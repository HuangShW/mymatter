> The inclusion of the Level Control cluster on this device is recommended to provide a consistent
>
> user experience when the device is grouped with additional dimmable lights and the “with on/off” commands are used. For this device, since its only states are on or off, if the Level Control cluster is implemented, it SHALL NOT have any effect on the actual light level except for those commands that cause an on/off state change, that is, the “with on/off” commands. In addition, if the Level Con­ trol cluster is implemented, the device SHALL accept and process Level Control cluster commands, adjusting the value of the CurrentLevel attribute accordingly and, where necessary, adjusting the On/Off cluster OnOff attribute.

> The inclusion of the Level Control cluster on this device is recommended to provide a consistent user experience when the device is grouped with additional dimmable lights and the “with on/off” commands are used. For this device, since its only states are on or off, if the Level Control cluster is implemented, it SHALL NOT have any effect on the actual light level except for those commands that cause an on/off state change, that is, the “with on/off” commands. In addition, if the Level Con­ trol cluster is implemented, the device SHALL accept and process Level Control cluster commands, adjusting the value of the CurrentLevel attribute accordingly and, where necessary, adjusting the On/Off cluster OnOff attribute.

### Cluster Restrictions

#### On/Off Cluster (Server) Clarifications

> The actions carried out by a Pump device on receipt of commands are shown in the following.
>
> *Table 10. Pump Actions on Receipt for On/Off Commands*

| **Command** | **Action on Receipt** |
|----|----|
| Off | If the pump is powered on, store the current level then immediately power it off. |
| On | If the pump is powered off, power it on and move immediately to the level stored by a previ­ ous Off command. If no such level has been stored, move immediately to the maximum level allowed for the pump. |
| Toggle | If the pump is powered on, proceed as for the Off command. If the device is powered off, pro­ ceed as for the On command. |

#### Level Control Cluster (Server) Clarifications

> The Level Control cluster SHALL allow controlling the pump setpoints. However, the transition time is always ignored.
>
> The setpoint of the pump is a percentage related to the level according to the following table.
>
> *Table 11. Relationship between Level and Setpoint*

| **Level** | **Setpoint**           | **Meaning**               |
|-----------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| 0         | N/A                    | Pump is stopped.          |
| 1–200     | Level / 2 (0.5–100.0%) | Pump setpoint in percent. |
| 201–255   | 100.0%                 | Pump setpoint is 100.0%   |

#### Identify Cluster

> This cluster is used to identify the device.

#### Valve Configuration and Control Cluster

> This cluster is used to configure and control (Open/Close) the valve.

#### Flow Measurement Cluster

> The cluster server, if present, SHALL be used to report the measured flow through the valve.
>
> The cluster client, if present, MAY be used via binding to close a control loop of flow through the valve.

### Device implementation recommendations

#### Start Up Behavior

> The start up behavior of a device with this device type, is currently not specified and is considered manufacturer specific. This means that the start up behavior and what is considered the "safe state", most suitable for the specific device, is defined by the manufacturer.

#### Firmware Update

> When a device with this device type needs to update its firmware (or restart for another reason), it is strongly recommended to only perform the update/restart when the valve is in its closed state, as well as ignoring any open request during this update/restart, given the chance a valve can uninten­ tionally be left in the open state, for longer periods of time.

# Chapter 6. Switches and Controls Device Types

> This Chapter specifies a number of "controller" device types like On/Off Light Switch and Dimmer Switch. Some products implementing these device types are intended to replace legacy switches or dimmers that directly control the power to a load. For such products, manufacturers are encour­ aged to implement an additional endpoint on the same product holding an "actuator" device type like an On/Off Light (or On/Off Plug-in Unit) or Dimmable Light (or Dimmable Plug-in Unit), consis­ tent with the type of control it can provide to the load. In case product can control multiple loads separately, multiple such endpoints to each hold a device type for each load.
>
> Additionally, having a central control function allows much richer automation triggered by a press of a switch. In such case, a switch works more like a sensor. For this, the Generic Switch device type is defined. See [Section 6.6, “Generic Switch”](#generic-switch). Manufacturers are encouraged to implement the Generic Switch device type as well in products that are generically referred to as switches. See [Sec­](#relation-with-other-switch-device-types-informative) [tion 6.6.5, “Relation with other Switch device types (informative)”](#relation-with-other-switch-device-types-informative) for examples how these device types can be combined.

#### Instantaneous reporting

> The generic mechanism for subscriptions and events might not ensure that detected interactions with the switch will be delivered "instantaneously" to the Switch client cluster in the interested party (they might be sent only after some time, e.g. due to batching of events and the Min Interval behavior for subscriptions). In order to achieve a good user experience, a device of this device type SHALL send updates of attributes and events defined in the Switch cluster without delay to sub­ scribed parties.

#### Labeling for multi-switch devices

> A Node which contains multiple switches will need to expose multiple endpoints each hosting an instance of this device type and the associated Switch cluster. This means the [Duplicate](#duplicate-condition) condition in Matter base device requirements applies, so a TagList SHALL be included in the Descriptor cluster on each such endpoint. The tag(s) in this TagList are used to indicate orientation (e.g. left and right for a two-button switch) or labeling (e.g. "dim up" and "dim down" icons printed on the buttons) rel­ evant to the user. A client SHOULD use these tags to convey such information to the user (e.g. show­ ing it in a user interface), to help the user identify which endpoint maps to a certain orientation or labeling.
>
> For the case where a server indicates tags from the Common Number Namespace, and the client presents entities related to the endpoints (e.g. icons for the various switches), it SHOULD present them in numerical order as indicated by the tags from the Common Number Namespace.
>
> For a Node which has only one endpoint hosting an instance of this device type and the associated Switch cluster, a TagList MAY be used. This can be beneficial in cases where the switch has some user-recognizable labeling.
>
> The TagList can contain a combination of tags from the namespaces defined in the Matter Semantic Tag Namespaces, including the namespace for switches (section 12 of that document) as well as tags from a manufacturer-specific namespace.
>
> In case the buttons have an intended function (e.g. engraved icon), the semantic tags from the Switches Namespace (section 12) SHALL be used where applicable. If there is no corresponding tag, a manufacturer-specific tag with a string Label SHOULD be used (see Example 2 below).
>
> To identify the location of a button on the device (e.g. top button of a two-button device), the seman­ tic tags from the Common Position Namespace (section 9) SHALL be used where applicable.
>
> For devices where these are not applicable or not sufficient (e.g. a switch device with four buttons in a row), the semantic tags from the Common Number Namespace (section 8) SHALL be used to enumerate the position of the buttons on the device, in left to right, top to bottom order, starting with Number.One for the first button.
>
> For devices to control a Closure, the semantic tags from the Common Closure Namespace (section 2)
>
> SHALL be used where applicable.
>
> Example 1: a device with two rocker switches (mounted side by side), which has two endpoints (11,12) for the switch-related functionality

- endpoint 11 has device type Generic Switch and contains

  - cluster Switch (feature flags: LS) exposing the state and events of the left button

  - cluster Descriptor with its TagList containing two tags: Position.Left and Number.One

- endpoint 12 has device type Generic Switch and contains

  - cluster Switch (feature flags: LS) exposing the state and events of the right button

  - cluster Descriptor with its TagList containing two tags: Position.Right and Number.Two

> If this device were to have labeling on the buttons like an "up" and "down" icon, the TagList would have a third tag (from the Switches Namespace) with values Switches.Up and Switches.Down respectively.
>
> Example 2: a device with four push buttons (mounted in a square), each labeled with an icon for a certain scene setting, which has four endpoints (21,22,23,24) for the switch-related functionality

- endpoint 21 has device type Generic Switch and contains

  - cluster Switch (feature flags: MS) exposing the events of the top-left button

  - cluster Descriptor with its TagList containing four tags: Position.Top, Position.Left, Num­ ber.One and (Tag=Switches.Custom, Label="watch tv")

    - This last tag is a Switches.Custom tag accompanied with a label (the other three tags do not need a Label field).

- endpoint 22 has device type Generic Switch and contains

  - cluster Switch (feature flags: MS) exposing the events of the top-right button

  - cluster Descriptor with its TagList containing four tags: Position.Top, Position.Right, Num­ ber.Two and (Tag=Switches.Custom, Label="dinner")

- endpoint 23 has device type Generic Switch and contains

  - cluster Switch (feature flags: MS) exposing the events of the bottom-left button

  - cluster Descriptor with its TagList containing four tags: Position.Bottom, Position.Left, Num­ ber.Three and (Tag=Switches.Custom, Label="reading")

- endpoint 24 has device type Generic Switch and contains

  - cluster Switch (feature flags: MS) exposing the events of the bottom-right button

  - cluster Descriptor with its TagList containing four tags: Position.Bottom, Position.Right, Number.Four and (Tag=Switches.Custom, Label="nightlight")

### Relation with other Switch device types (informative)

> The Generic Switch device type and the On/Off Light Switch device type both convey information about interactions with a switch to another device.

- The On/Off Light Switch will send On/Off/Toggle commands from its On/Off (client) cluster to a device implementing the On/Off (server) cluster to control the on/off functionality of that device. An On/Off Light Switch device can also implement Groups and Scenes Management clus­ ters and thus send group and scene commands. Basically, it is targeted at directly sending con­ trol commands to other devices. The binding table is used to tell the device where to send the commands.

- The Generic Switch device type will send updates of attributes (for Latching Switch only) and events to subscribed parties which implement the Switch client cluster, as indications of inter­ action with the switch - leaving the interpretation (e.g. which device should be actuated because of the interaction) to the subscribed party. So it can be compared to a sensor-type device.

> This allows a more comprehensive controller to combine the information from the switch with other inputs or information sources (e.g. time of day, user presence) to determine which control commands (e.g. on/off, scene recall, attribute change) are sent to other devices in the network.
>
> A device manufacturer MAY implement both device types on the same switch device, to allow it to be used for both types of control, as in this example for a rocker switch which implements:

- endpoint 31 with device type On/Off Light Switch which contains

  - (client) cluster On/Off exposing the On/Off/Toggle commands

- endpoint 32 with device type Generic Switch which contains

  - (server) cluster Switch (feature flags: LS) exposing the state and events of the switch

> When this device is used in a particular setup, binding tables and subscriptions can be used to determine how it is used:

- used as an On/Off Light Switch (no subscriptions to endpoint 32)

- used as a Generic Switch (no bindings on endpoint 31)

- used as both at the same time. In this case, an interaction with the switch would result in an On/Off/Toggle command being sent to devices listed in the binding table of endpoint 31, as well as attribute update and events being sent towards devices having a subscription with endpoint 32.

### Multi-modality sensors

> The Occupancy Sensing cluster defines multiple modalities that can be employed to sense occu­ pancy. A device implementing multiple such modalities (exposed in the feature flags) can be imple­ mented in two ways:

- A single endpoint with an Occupancy Sensing cluster which has two or more of these feature bits set to 1.

  - This requires reporting the combination the sensing results as a single bit in the Occupancy attribute (and the OccupancyChanged event, when supported), with a single set of timing parameters applied.

  - Sensitivity setting (via a Boolean State Configuration cluster on the same endpoint) applies to all the sensing modalities together via a manufacturer-specific mapping.

- Multiple endpoints each hosting an Occupancy Sensing cluster (each with one feature bit set):

  - The sensing result of each modality is reported separately in the Occupancy attribute (and the OccupancyChanged event, when supported) of each endpoint, governed by the set of timing parameters provided in the cluster on that endpoint.

    - This implies some of these attributes can have a different values than their counterparts on other endpoints and that a client MAY have to combine these values if it wants to derive a single value.

  - Each modality can be provided with an independent sensitivity setting via a Boolean State Configuration cluster located on one or more of the endpoints.

> Please see the Base Device Type definition for conformance tags.

### Device Type Requirements

> A fan MAY expose elements of its functionality through one or more additional device types on dif­ ferent endpoints. All devices used in compositions SHALL adhere to the disambiguation require­ ments of the System Model. Other device types, not explicitly listed in the table, MAY also be included in device compositions but are not considered part of the core functionality of the device.

### Cluster Restrictions

#### On/Off Cluster (Server) Clarifications

> The On/Off cluster is independent from the Fan Control Cluster’s FanMode attribute, which also includes an Off setting.
>
> If the FanMode attribute of the Fan Control cluster is set to a value other than Off when the OnOff
>
> attribute of the On/Off cluster transitions from TRUE to FALSE, it may be desirable to restore the FanMode, SpeedSetting and PercentSetting attribute values of the Fan Control cluster when the OnOff attribute of the On/Off cluster later transitions from FALSE to TRUE. If the FanMode is set to Off when the device is turned off, this information is lost, as the SpeedSetting and PercentSetting will be set to zero. Using the On/Off cluster alongside the Fan Control cluster allows the FanMode, SpeedSetting and PercentSetting to remain unchanged when the device is turned off. In this case, the On/Off cluster would be set to Off, and the SpeedCurrent and PercentCurrent set to zero, without changing FanMode, SpeedSetting and PercentSetting.

### Cluster Restrictions

#### On/Off Cluster (Server) Clarifications

> The On/Off cluster is independent from the Fan Control Cluster’s FanMode attribute, which also includes an Off setting.
>
> If the FanMode attribute of the Fan Control cluster is set to a value other than Off when the OnOff attribute of the On/Off cluster transitions from TRUE to FALSE, it may be desirable to restore the FanMode, SpeedSetting and PercentSetting attribute values of the Fan Control cluster when the OnOff attribute of the On/Off cluster later transitions from FALSE to TRUE. If the FanMode is set to Off when the device is turned off, this information is lost, as the SpeedSetting and PercentSetting will be set to zero. Using the On/Off cluster alongside the Fan Control cluster allows the FanMode, SpeedSetting and PercentSetting to remain unchanged when the device is turned off. In this case, the On/Off cluster would be set to Off, and the SpeedCurrent and PercentCurrent set to zero, without changing FanMode, SpeedSetting and PercentSetting.

# Chapter 10. Media Device Types

## Video Player Architecture

### Introduction

> A Video Player endpoint (either Casting Video Player or Basic Video Player) represents a device that is able to play media to a physical output or to a display screen which is part of the device. For example, a Video Player can be a traditional TV device, a physical media playback device such as a DVD Player, a TV Set Top Box, or a content streaming device that provides input to another device like a TV or computer monitor.
>
> Video Player features can be categorized into **basic** and **content launching**.
>
> The **basic** features include (conceptually): On/Off, Volume Control, Playback Control, Channel Change, Input Control, Output Control, Sleep/Wake, Target Navigation and Keypad Navigation.
>
> The **content launching** features include: discovery and launch of Content Apps, search and launch of content by content name and by URL.
>
> A Basic Video Player is a **commissionable node** and supports these basic features which include, at a minimum, media playback controls (Media Playback cluster server) and remote controls (Keypad Input cluster server).
>
> A Casting Video Player is a **commissioner** and supports both the Basic Video Player features and content launching features which include, at a minimum, the ability to launch content (Content Launcher cluster server).
>
> A Content App is usually an application built by a Content Provider and exists as a separate end­ point on a Casting Video Player with a Content App Platform.
>
> When a Casting Video Player includes a Content App Platform, it can launch Content Apps (Applica­ tion Launcher cluster server) and represent these apps as separate endpoints on the Node.
>
> A Video Remote Control is a **commissionable node** used to control basic features including, at a minimum, the ability to initiate keypad navigation (Keypad Input cluster client) and media play­ back (Media Playback cluster client).
>
> A Casting Video Client is a **commissionable node** which extends the Video Remote Control features with the ability to initiate content launching (Content Launcher cluster client). A Casting Video Client is often associated with a Content App built by a specific Content Provider - for example, the Vendor Id of the Content App’s Application Basic cluster will match the Vendor Id of the Casting Video Client.

> *Figure 1. Video Player Device Types*

### Clients of a Casting Video Player

> The clients for a Video Player device can be categorized into 2 high-level groups.

1.  Clients controlling the Video Player endpoint such as a remote control (eg : Video Remote device type)

2.  Clients controlling specific Content App(s) such as a Phone App casting to a corresponding Con­ tent App (eg : Casting Video Client device type)

### Endpoint Composition for Content Apps of a Casting Video Player

> A Casting Video Player with a Content App Platform SHALL represent each Content App as its own dedicated endpoint where each is identified using the Device ID 0x0024 for "Content App".
>
> The requirements for allocating and deallocating an endpoint address for a Content App SHALL be as described in the System Model specification (see "Dynamic Endpoint allocation").
>
> The following diagram shows a Video Player device containing 3 separate Content Apps:
>
> ![](media/image4.png)
>
> *Figure 2. Endpoint Composition for Video Player Device*

### Commissioning

> A Basic Video Player SHALL be commissioned like any commissionable node.
>
> A Casting Video Player SHALL be a Commissioner. The primary reason for this requirement is to enable the Casting Video Player to verify, using device attestation, the vendor of a Client for the pur­ pose of controlling content on the Casting Video Player, and to ensure that only clients authorized by a Content App can control it. In this way, a Commissionee associated with a Content App on the Casting Video Player can be commissioned by the Casting Video Player and granted access to the endpoint associated with that Content App.
>
> When a Casting Video Player commissions a Client, such as a Video Remote Control or a Casting Video Client, the Casting Video Player SHALL determine the Content App access for the given Client following the rules defined in this section. Since the Client is being commissioned by the Casting Video Player, the Client, which may be a phone app, SHALL include attestation credentials which are used by the Casting Video Player to determine its Vendor ID.

3.  A Casting Video Player SHOULD allow each Content App to specify which clusters it implements, and reflect these clusters in the corresponding endpoint for the given Content App. The method for conveying this information between the Content App and the Casting Video Player is specific to the vendor of the Casting Video Player.

4.  A Casting Video Player SHALL allow each Content App to specify values for fields in the Applica­ tion Basic cluster, such as Vendor ID and Application Name. A Casting Video Player SHALL also use this information to determine access control for Clients commissioned by the Casting Video Player. The method for conveying this information between the Content App and the Casting Video Player is specific to the vendor of the Casting Video Player.

5.  A Casting Video Player device SHALL allow each Content App to provide an Allowed Controller Vendor ID list. The Allowed Controller Vendor ID list specifies a list of Vendor IDs for Clients that SHALL be granted access to the endpoint for the given Content App. The Casting Video Player device SHALL use the Allowed Controller Vendor ID list to determine access control for Clients commissioned by the Casting Video Player. Only Clients with a Vendor ID in the Allowed Con­ troller Vendor ID list SHALL be granted access to the given Content App endpoint. The method for conveying this information between the Content App and the Casting Video Player is specific to the vendor of the Casting Video Player. When a Client is commissioned, its attested Vendor ID is used to determine access to Content App endpoints. The Allowed Controller Vendor ID list is contained in the AllowedVendorList attribute of the Application Basic cluster.

> A Casting Video Player MAY enable a commissioning flow, which avoids Setup PIN entry by the user, when the following conditions are met:

1.  The Client’s Vendor ID and a Rotating ID (used as a TempAccountIdentifier) are present in its commissionable node advertisement, or present in a User Directed Commissioning message sent by the Client to initiate commissioning with the Casting Video Player.

2.  The Casting Video Player is able to determine an endpoint corresponding to the given Vendor ID which contains the Account Login cluster (for example, a Content App endpoint).

3.  The Account Login cluster’s GetSetupPIN command returns a SetupPIN which is then used suc­ cessfully to commission the Client.

> A Casting Video Player MAY enable a Content App account login flow, which avoids login name and password entry by the user, when the following conditions are met:

1.  The Client’s Vendor ID and a Rotating ID (used as a TempAccountIdentifier) are present in its commissionable node advertisement, or present in a User Directed Commissioning message sent by the Client to initiate commissioning with the Casting Video Player.

2.  The Casting Video Player is able to determine an endpoint corresponding to the given Vendor ID which contains the Account Login cluster (for example, a Content App endpoint).

3.  The Account Login cluster’s Login command returns successfully.

> In these flows, when the Account Login cluster is located on a Content App endpoint, the Account Login cluster will often be implemented by a different vendor from the Casting Video Player itself. See AccountLoginCluster for further details on the use of these commands.
>
> Since a Client commissioned by the Casting Video Player will only have access to one or more Con­ tent App endpoints and the Speaker endpoint (when present), it will not have the ability to access the Application Launcher cluster on the Casting Video Player endpoint. If they do not already exist, the Casting Video Player device SHALL create endpoints for each Content App to which the Client has access and notify the Client of such access by adding an entry for each Content App to the Bind­ ing cluster of the Client. The Casting Video Player device SHALL automatically launch the Content
>
> App upon commands targeted to a Content App endpoint.
>
> The following steps are performed by a Casting Video Player when granting and removing Client access to Content App endpoints:

1.  Upon commissioning a Client and granting it access to a Content App endpoint, the Casting Video Player SHALL invoke the Login command of the AccountLogin cluster on the Content App endpoint (when implemented by the Content App) in order to notify the Content App endpoint of the Client.

    1.  If the Client is a Casting Video Client and it implements the Content App Observer server cluster, and if the Content App endpoint implements both the Binding server cluster and the Content App Observer client cluster, then the Casting Video Player SHALL create a binding on the Content App endpoint which specifies the Node and Endpoint of the Casting Video Client’s Content App Observer server cluster. The Casting Video Player SHALL provide a way for the Content App to send a Content App Observer cluster ContentAppMessage command to the Casting Video Client and to receive a ContentAppMessageResponse in return.

2.  Upon removing access to a Content App endpoint for a Client, the Casting Video Player SHALL invoke the Logout command of the AccountLogin cluster on the Content App endpoint (when implemented by the Content App) in order to notify the Content App endpoint that Client access has been removed.

    1.  If the Casting Video Player created a binding on the Content App endpoint corresponding to the Casting Video Client’s Content App Observer server cluster, then the Casting Video Player SHALL remove this binding.

> When the Content App endpoint generates a LoggedOut event, the Casting Video Player SHALL remove access to the Node specified to the given Content App endpoint.

#### NOTE

> A Client commissioned by the Casting Video Player is able to determine if the corre­ sponding Content App is visible to the user using the **Status** attribute on the Appli­ cation Basic cluster for the Content App endpoint. This ensures that the Client can­ not access foreground Content App information about any other Content App to which it does not have access. It also ensures that such a client will only need access to specific Content App endpoints and the Speaker endpoint (when present).

### Determining Context

> A client that controls multiple aspects of the Video Player functionality (like a voice assistant) may have access to multiple endpoints on the Video Player. To determine the current context on the Video Player when the user interacts with the client (for example, when the user interacts with the device using voice), the client can look at the state in the various clusters on the Casting Video Player.
>
> Specifically:

1.  Media Input cluster (when CurrentInput does NOT have type INTERNAL, then Video Player is displaying content from a physical input)

2.  Application Launcher cluster (CurrentApp indicates the current application endpoint - which

> may be the Video Player endpoint when no Content App is in the foreground).

3.  Target Navigator cluster on current application endpoint (indicates which navigation target the user is in)

> The Video Player SHOULD provide a way for the user to view the list of clients with access to con­ trol the screen and SHOULD provide a way for the user to revoke this access.

### Basic Video Player Features

#### On/Off/Toggle

> This feature turns on/off the user-visible power state of the device, corresponding to the on/off/tog­ gle button usually found on a remote or button on the device.
>
> An On/Off cluster on the Video Player endpoint SHALL be used for this feature.

#### Volume Control

> This feature controls the speaker volume of the device.
>
> A Speaker endpoint SHALL be used for this feature when the device controls a speaker.

#### Media Playback Control

> This feature controls media playback on the device which includes functionality such as Play, Pause, Stop, Rewind, and Fast Forward.
>
> The Media Playback cluster SHALL be used for this functionality.

#### Channel Change

> This feature controls channel control functionality on the device which includes functionality such as lineup discovery, change and skip channels.
>
> The Channel cluster SHALL be used for this functionality.

#### Media Input Control

> The Media Input cluster SHALL be used for this functionality.

#### Audio Output Control

> This feature controls audio output selection on the device which includes functionality such as out­ put discovery, selection and naming.
>
> The Audio Output cluster SHALL be used for this functionality.
>
> Note that when the current output is set to an output of type HDMI, adjustments to volume via a
>
> Speaker endpoint on the same node MAY cause HDMI volume up/down commands to be sent to the given HDMI output.

#### Sleep/Wake

> This feature controls low power mode on the device which includes functionality such as sleep, and declaration of protocols supported for Wakeup.
>
> The Low Power cluster SHALL be used for putting a device into low power (sleep) mode.
>
> The WakeOnLAN cluster SHALL be used for declaring that a device supports the WakeOnLAN pro­ tocol.

#### Target Navigation

> This feature controls on-screen navigation to custom-named targets, for example, "Settings", "On Demand" and "Search". A list of named targets can be provided for the Video Player endpoint itself, as well as for Content App represented as endpoints.
>
> The Target Navigator cluster SHALL be used for listing navigation targets, invoking navigation to a target, and tracking the current target.

#### Keypad Navigation

> This feature controls on-screen navigation, commonly referred to as D-Pad navigation, and includes navigation commands such as UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, SELECT, BACK, EXIT, MENU.
>
> The Keypad Input cluster SHALL be used for this functionality.

#### Account Login

> This cluster provides commands that facilitate user account login on an application or a node. The Account Login cluster SHALL be used for this functionality.

### Content Launching Features

> Many Video Player devices (traditional TVs, Set Top Boxes, Content Streamers) have advanced fea­ tures that MAY include any of the following:

- the ability to search for and playback content such as movies and TV shows

- a platform for Content Apps that can themselves be launched, and instructed to search and playback content such as movies and TV shows

- the ability to download and playback basic content referenced by URL

#### Discover and Launch Content App from another Device

> This feature allows a client to discover the Content App identification catalogs supported by a Video Player device, and launch an Application based upon a Content App identifier within a given cata­ log. An example Content App identification catalog is the DIAL registry ([http://www.dial-multi­](http://www.dial-multiscreen.org/)
>
> [screen.org/](http://www.dial-multiscreen.org/)).
>
> The Application Launcher cluster SHALL be used for this functionality.

#### Launch Content from another Device

> Content search and launch is defined by the Content Launcher cluster which includes feature flags for Content Search and URL Playback which are used to indicate which of these features is sup­ ported.
>
> The Content Launcher cluster SHALL be used for this functionality.

## Basic Video Player

> This defines conformance to the Basic Video Player device type.
>
> A Video Player (either Basic or Casting) represents a device that is able to play media to a physical output or to a display screen which is part of the device.
>
> A Basic Video Player has playback controls (play, pause, etc.) and keypad remote controls (up, down, number input), but is not able to launch content and is not a content app platform (the Cast­ ing Video Player device type is used for these functions).
>
> For example, a Basic Video Player can be a traditional TV device a physical media playback device such as a DVD Player, or a device that provides input to another device like a TV or computer moni­ tor.
>
> Please see [Video Player Architecture](#video-player-architecture) for additional Basic Video Player requirements relating to Video Player device endpoint composition, commissioning, feature representation in clusters, and UI context.

## Speaker

> This defines conformance to the Speaker device type. This feature controls the speaker volume of the device.
>
> To control unmute/mute, the On/Off cluster SHALL be used. A value of TRUE for the OnOff attribute SHALL represent the volume on (not muted) state, while a value of FALSE SHALL represent the vol­ ume off (muted) state. For volume level control, the Level cluster SHALL be used.
>
> A dedicated endpoint is needed because the On/Off cluster can also be used for other purposes, such as for power control.
>
> The decision to use Level and On/Off clusters for volume (rather than defining a new audio control cluster) was made in order to treat volume in a fashion consistent with lighting which also uses these clusters and has matching functional requirements.

### Cluster Usage

> This section describes how to control and monitor the operation of a Robotic Vacuum Cleaner device. This information is meant to clarify how the data dependencies within the device type’s cluster composition are to be used.
>
> Note that the device operations may also be the result of, or affected by, out-of-band actions such as robot physical button presses, internally scheduled events, vendor application requests, commands sent from other fabrics, internal device timeouts, etc. For example, a user may pause the robot dur­ ing cleaning by using a Matter client and then resume cleaning by using a physical button of the device, or a robot may stop cleaning after an internal timeout occurs, and so forth.
>
> The RVC Operational State cluster’s OperationalState attribute SHALL be updated according to the state of the device, and therefore it SHOULD be used for monitoring purposes. Note that while the robot is in a cleaning cycle it may automatically seek the charger, recharge, and then resume clean­ ing.
>
> The sections below describe various operational flows with preconditions and actions. The behav­ ior in case the preconditions are not met is described in the corresponding cluster descriptions.

#### Starting Cleaning

1.  **Preconditions**

> Cleaning can only be started when the RVC Run Mode cluster’s CurrentMode attribute is set to a mode that has the Idle mode tag associated with it, and the RVC Operational State cluster’s Opera­ tionalState attribute is set to the Stopped, Paused, Docked or Charging state.
>
> Note that if the RVC Clean Mode cluster is implemented, it determines the type of cleaning.

2.  **Actions**

> To attempt starting a cleaning operation, the RVC Run Mode cluster can be sent a ChangeToMode command with the NewMode field set to a mode that has the Cleaning mode tag associated with it.

#### Pausing Cleaning

3.  **Preconditions**

> Cleaning can only be paused when the RVC Operational State cluster’s OperationalState attribute is set to a Pause-compatible state. See the Pause Compatibility table and the RVC Pause Compatibility Table.
>
> Note that even if the Pause command is not implemented, the RVC Operational State cluster’s Oper­ ationalState attribute MAY report that the device is in the Paused state due to an out-of-band action, such as the user pressing a physical button on the device.

4.  **Actions**

> To attempt pausing a cleaning operation, the RVC Operational State cluster can be sent a Pause com­ mand.

#### Resuming Cleaning

5.  **Preconditions**

> Cleaning can only be resumed if the RVC Operational State cluster’s OperationalState attribute is set to a Resume-compatible state (see Resume Compatibility table and the RVC Resume Compatibility table), and the RVC Run Mode cluster’s CurrentMode is set to a mode with the Cleaning mode tag.
>
> Note that even if the Resume command is not implemented, the RVC Operational State cluster’s OperationalState attribute MAY indicate that the device transitioned from the Paused state to the Running state due to an out-of-band action, such as the user pressing a physical button on the device.

6.  **Actions**

> To attempt resuming a cleaning operation, the RVC Operational State cluster can be sent a Resume command.

#### Stopping Cleaning

7.  **Preconditions**

> Stopping cleaning can only happen if the RVC Run Mode cluster’s CurrentMode attribute is set to a mode that has the Cleaning mode tag associated with it.

8.  **Actions**

> To attempt stopping a cleaning operation, the RVC Run Mode cluster can be sent a ChangeToMode command with the NewMode field set to a mode that has the Idle mode tag associated with it.

9.  **Side Effects**

> Note that the device MAY seek the charger after successfully switching the RVC Run Mode cluster to an Idle mode. The OperationalState attribute indicates whether the device is seeking the charger, stopped, charging, docked etc.

#### Other Device Operations

> The RVC Run Mode cluster’s SupportedModes attribute list MAY include modes that have neither the Idle nor the Cleaning mode tags, for example the Mapping mode tag.
>
> Starting, pausing, resuming and stopping these other operations have similar preconditions, actions and side effects as those described above for the cleaning operations.

#### Device Error Handling

> When in an error condition, as indicated by the RVC Operational State cluster’s OperationalState attribute, out-of-band action will be required to clear that condition.
>
> If an error occurs while the device operates, such as while cleaning or while mapping, the device MAY pause and set the RVC Operational State cluster’s OperationalState attribute to Error. If the operation can be resumed after the error is cleared, the device SHALL set the RVC Operational State
>
> cluster’s OperationalState attribute to Paused and MAY be resumed either via a Resume command, if implemented, or by out-of-band actions, such as by pressing the robot’s physical buttons.
>
> Note that certain errors may not pause or disable the device. For example, a dual-function device, that can both vacuum and mop, may report a WaterTankEmpty error but may still be able to be used if it has a vacuum only cleaning mode. Certain modes of the RVC Run Mode and the RVC Clean­ ing Mode clusters MAY become unavailable and the ChangeToModeResponse commands' Status­ Code SHALL be set to InvalidInMode, when attempting to switch to those modes.

### Cluster Restrictions

#### On/Off Cluster (Server) Clarifications

> As indicated in the Element Requirements section below, the DF (Dead Front) feature is required for the On/Off cluster in this device type. See the "DeadFrontBehavior feature" section in the On/Off cluster description for detailed requirements. The "dead front" state is linked to the OnOff attribute in the On/Off cluster having the value False. Thus, the Off command of the On/Off cluster SHALL move the device into the "dead front" state, the On command of the On/Off cluster SHALL bring the device out of the "dead front" state, and the device SHALL adhere with the associated requirements on subscription handling and event reporting.

#### Best Effort Attribute Values in "Dead Front" State

> When in "dead front", should the operational values of the cluster attributes not be available or accessible, the following are the RECOMMENDED best effort values for per cluster attributes when responding to a new subscription request or a read request. Attributes not listed have no change in their defined or expected values.

## Refrigerator

> A refrigerator represents a device that contains one or more cabinets that are capable of chilling or freezing food. Examples of consumer products that MAY make use of this device type include refrig­ erators, freezers, and wine coolers.

### Refrigerator Architecture

> A Refrigerator is always defined via endpoint composition. See the [Section 13.2.5, “Device Type](#device-type-requirements-6) [Requirements”](#device-type-requirements-6) section for more details.
>
> A Refrigerator MAY include a semantic tag in the TagList attribute of the Descriptor cluster to describe the primary function of the device, e.g., "Refrigerator" or "Freezer".
>
> An example of a Refrigerator with multiple cabinets is illustrated below.

### Cluster Restrictions

#### On/Off Cluster (Server) Clarifications

> As indicated in the Element Requirements section below, the DF (Dead Front) feature is required for the On/Off cluster in this device type. See the "DeadFrontBehavior feature" section in the On/Off cluster description for detailed requirements. The "dead front" state is linked to the OnOff attribute in the On/Off cluster having the value False. Thus, the Off command of the On/Off cluster SHALL move the device into the "dead front" state, the On command of the On/Off cluster SHALL bring the device out of the "dead front" state, and the device SHALL adhere with the associated requirements on subscription handling and event reporting.

#### Best Effort Attribute Values in "Dead Front" State

> When in "dead front", should the operational values of the cluster attributes not be available or accessible, the following are the RECOMMENDED best effort values for per cluster attributes when responding to a new subscription request or a read request. Attributes not listed have no change in their defined or expected values.

### Conditions

### Device Type Requirements

> A Cooktop SHALL be composed of zero or more endpoints with the Cook Surface device type as defined by the conformance below.
>
> A cooktop falls under strict regulatory control in some regions. One of these restrictions for non- induction cooktops is that the only remote commands available are to turn off the entire device or read out the temperature setting. This one scenario for allowed remote operation is specifically to address the use case of a device that is left on after a user leaves the home. The individual cooking surfaces cannot be shut off. This leads to a model of a cooktop that has 0 controllable cooking sur­ faces. For example, the requirements that exist for a gas cooktop would result in zero Cook Surface instances being exposed.
>
> If the Cooktop contains more than one instance of a Cook Surface, those instances SHALL include a semantic tag in the TagList attribute of the Descriptor cluster to disambiguate the cook surface, e.g., "front", "left", or "back". Such a semantic tag SHALL be from the Common namespaces.

### Cluster Usage

> This section describes how to control and monitor the operation of a Microwave Oven device. This information is meant to clarify how the data dependencies within the device type’s cluster composi­ tion are to be used.
>
> Note that the device operations may also be the result of, or affected by, out-of-band actions such as physical button presses on the device, internally scheduled events, vendor application requests, commands invoked via other fabrics, internal device timeouts, etc. For example, a user may pause the oven during operation by opening the door to check on the food.

#### Starting the Oven

> The oven operational attributes are set by sending the SetCookingParameters command of the Microwave Oven Control cluster with the values as intended by the user via a client. Oven opera­ tion can be started by sending the Start command via the Operational State cluster or one of its
>
> derivatives, if supported, or within the SetCookingParameters command via the StartAfterSetting attribute, if supported.
>
> Upon setting the CookTime attribute via the SetCookingParameters command, the CountdownTime attribute of the Operational State cluster or one of its derivatives , if supported, is set to the same value as the CookTime attribute.
>
> Once oven operation is started, the values previously sent by the SetCookingParameters command are used to control the oven operation and the CountdownTime attribute of the Operational State cluster or one of its derivatives begins counting down.

#### During Operation

> While the oven is in the Running state, the CountdownTime attribute of the Operational State clus­ ter or one of its derivatives counts down and the CookTime attribute of the Microwave Oven Con­ trol cluster remains fixed.

#### Stopping the Oven

> Oven operation will end when either the Stop command of the Operational State cluster or one of its derivatives, if supported, is sent, the CountdownTime value reaches zero, or the oven is stopped via an out-of-band method.
>
> It is recommended that when the oven enters the Stopped state of the Operational State cluster or one of its derived clusters, the attribute values of the Microwave Oven Control cluster be set to their default values by the server.

#### Adding More Time

> When time is added to the CookTime attribute using the AddMoreTime command of the Microwave Oven Control cluster, the same amount of time is also added to the CountdownTime attribute of the Operational State cluster or one of its derivatives. See the CookTime attribute constraints and AddMoreTime command for more details.

## Water Heater Device Type

> A water heater is a device that is generally installed in properties to heat water for showers, baths etc.

### Water Heater Architecture

> A Water Heater is always defined via endpoint composition.
>
> If a Water Heater supports multiple temperature measurement sensors as child elements, it SHALL include a separate endpoint for each sensor. Each endpoint SHALL include a semantic tag in the TagList attribute of the Descriptor cluster to describe the relevant position of the sensor. Such a semantic tag SHALL be from the defined Common Position namespace (i.e. Top, Middle, Bottom etc).
>
> For basic control features the Water Heater re-uses the Thermostat cluster with the **HEAT** and **SCH** features. This allows it to have daily schedules set as to when the hot water heating is enabled, as well as setting the desired setpoint of the hot water.
>
> Additional features of the Water Heater (such as reporting estimated hot water content, and smart reheating functions) are provided by the Water Heater application cluster.
>
> In order to add energy management capability, the Device Energy Management cluster may be optionally supported, and if so, the Electrical Power Measurement and Electrical Energy Measure­ ment clusters are supported via the Electrical Sensor device type.
>
> An example of a Water Heater device is illustrated below.

## Battery Storage Device Type

> A Battery Storage device is a device that allows a DC battery, which can optionally be comprised of a set parallel strings of battery packs and associated controller, and an AC inverter, to be monitored and controlled by an Energy Management System in order to manage the peaks and troughs of sup­ ply and demand, and/or to optimize cost of the energy consumed in premises. It is not intended to be used for a UPS directly supplying a set of appliances, nor for portable battery storage devices.

# Chapter 15. Network Infrastructure Device Types

## Introduction

> Matter aims to build a universal IPv6-based communication protocol for smart home devices, and in principle almost any IPv6-bearing Wi-Fi, Thread, or Ethernet network is suitable for Matter deployment (see *Network Topology* in [\[MatterCore\]](#_bookmark4)).
>
> The Network Infrastructure device types defined in this chapter are designed to provide a reliable, secure, and performant connectivity experience for Matter devices and their users. To achieve this, these device types expose Matter application clusters for the purposes of network management, diagnostics, and configuration. They also include requirements on lower layers (including the net­ work and physical layers) that contribute to the desired connectivity experience.
>
> Note that Matter devices and applications cannot rely on the presence of Matter-certified Network Infrastructure Devices, or the presence of network features mandated by these device types, for their correct operation.

## Network Infrastructure Manager Device Type

> A Network Infrastructure Manager provides interfaces that allow for the management of the Wi-Fi, Thread, and Ethernet networks underlying a Matter deployment, realizing the *Star Network Topol­ ogy* described in [\[MatterCore\]](#_bookmark4).
>
> Examples of physical devices that implement the Matter Network Infrastructure Manager device type include Wi-Fi gateway routers.
>
> Relevant hardware and software requirements for Network Infrastructure Manager devices are defined in [Section 15.2.6, “Other Requirements”](#other-requirements) and within the clusters mandated by this device type.
>
> A Network Infrastructure Manager device MAY be managed by a service associated with the device vendor, for example, an Internet Service Provider. Sometimes this managing service will have poli­ cies that require the use of the Managed Device feature of the Access Control Cluster (see [Section](#access-control-mngd-conformance-1) [15.2.5.1, “Access Control MNGD Conformance”](#access-control-mngd-conformance-1)). Consequently, Commissioners of this device type should be aware of this feature and its use.

|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0x001F | Access Con­ trol | Feature | MNGD |  |  | desc |

#### Access Control MNGD Conformance

> A Network Infrastructure Manager device MAY utilize the Managed Device (MNGD) feature flag of the Access Control Cluster on the device’s Root Node endpoint (i.e. Endpoint 0).
>
> Please refer to the "Managed Device Feature Usage Restrictions" section in the Access Control Clus­ ter chapter of the Matter Core Specification for the complete set of limitations on use of this feature on endpoints with the Network Infrastructure Manager device type.

#### NOTE

> The conformance of this element crosses endpoints. It is expressed against the Root Node endpoint and there SHALL NOT be a separate AccessControl cluster on the
>
> endpoint having the Network Infrastructure Manager device type.

### Other Requirements

> The device SHALL implement a bridged Wi-Fi / Ethernet hub network, enabling IPv6 connectivity between Matter Nodes across transports.

#### Ethernet Requirements

> The device SHALL provide an Ethernet LAN interface that is part of the bridged hub network.
>
> The Root Node endpoint of the device MAY include a Network Commissioning cluster associated with this Ethernet interface.

#### Wi-Fi Requirements

> The device SHALL support the operation of an IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi network (ESS) and provide access to the SSID and credentials of this network via the Wi-Fi Network Management cluster. The mecha­ nisms by which this network is configured are outside the scope of this specification. The device SHALL support concurrently operating BSSs for this ESS in the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands; it MAY support operating additional BSSs for this ESS in other frequency bands such as 6 GHz or sub-1 GHz. All BSSs in this ESS SHALL be part of the bridged hub network, i.e. bridged to each other and to the Ethernet interface.
>
> The device MAY support operating additional Wi-Fi networks (e.g. a "guest network"); the require­ ments above do not apply to any such additional networks.
>
> The device SHOULD NOT include any Network Commissioning cluster instances associated with the Wi-Fi Access Point interface.
>
> The device SHALL be certified by the Wi-Fi Alliance in the Access Point role for Wi-Fi 6 or above. It SHALL additionally be certified in the Access Point role for Wi-Fi 6E if it supports operating in the 6 GHz band, and for Wi-Fi HaLow if it supports operating in the sub-1 GHz band.

#### Thread Requirements

> The Network Infrastructure Manager device SHALL be certified by the Thread Group as *Built on Thread: Border Router* based on Thread 1.3.0 or above. It SHOULD be certified based on Thread
>
> 1.4.0 or above.
>
> **NOTE** Certification based on Thread 1.4.0 or above will become mandatory in Matter 1.5.
>
> The device SHALL implement a Thread Border Router as described by the Thread specification, and provide connectivity between the Thread network and the Wi-Fi / Ethernet hub network. The Thread Interface associated with the Border Router SHALL be exposed via the Thread Border Router Management cluster.
>
> The device SHOULD NOT include any Network Commissioning cluster instances associated with the Thread Border Router.

#### Discovery and Commissioning

> A Network Infrastructure Manager device SHOULD implement Extended Discovery in order to be discoverable by entities on the local IP network, even when not in Commissioning Mode, and SHOULD populate the optional *device type* subtype (e.g., \_T144) to allow for filtering of discovery results to find only Nodes that match the Network Infrastructure Manager device type (see Commis­ sioning Subtypes).
>
> A Network Infrastructure Manager SHOULD populate the following DNS-SD TXT record key/value pairs in the Commissionable Node Discovery response: Commissioning Pairing Hint, and Commission­ ing Pairing Instruction so that the Commissioner can guide the user through the steps needed to put the Commissionee into Commissioning Mode. If the Network Infrastructure Manager provides its own app or website which includes a UX for putting the device into Commissioning Mode, then the device SHOULD populate the Commissioning VID/PID key/value pair and SHOULD set bit 1 of the Pairing Hint (Device Manufacturer URL), so that the Commissioner can utilize the URL specified in the CommissioningCustomFlowUrl of the DeviceModel schema entry indexed by the Vendor ID and Prod­ uct ID in the Distributed Compliance Ledger and utilize flows described in Custom Commissioning Flow to redirect the user to a custom app or website specified by the device vendor, and receive the user back following the callback flow which contains the onboarding payload. This flow is described in detail in the Initiating Commissioning section of the Matter Core specification, under the User Journey titled User-Initiated Beacon Detection, Already Commissioned Device.

## Thread Border Router Device Type

> A Thread Border Router device type provides interfaces for querying and configuring the associ­ ated Thread network.
>
> Instances of physical devices categorized as Thread Border Routers encompass standalone Thread Border Routers, conventional application devices like smart speakers, media streamers, and light­ ing fixtures equipped with a Thread Border Router, as well as Wi-Fi Routers incorporating Thread Border Router functionality.
>
> The necessary hardware and software prerequisites are detailed within the clusters that are man­ dated by this device type.

### Usage

> The Thread Border Router Device Type provides the Thread Border Router Management Cluster with the goal of ensuring a seamless user experience when adding a new Border Router to form a new Thread network or join an existing one. This section presents informative configuration sequences that a Fabric Admin can set up to improve coverage and Internet access redundancy for Thread networks using the Thread Border Router device type. Four use cases are covered:

- Initial configuration of a Thread Border Router when no PAN exists

- Joining an existing PAN

- Sharing an existing PAN

- Moving to a new PAN

#### Initial configuration of Thread Border Router

> In this use case, there is initially no PAN at the user’s home. The user installs a Matter certified Thread Border Router to use Thread connectivity for their Matter devices.

![](media/image49.png)

> After installation, the PAN configured by Admin A on the Thread Border Router is used to install the Thread Matter device on Fabric A.

#### Joining an existing PAN

> In this use case, there is already a PAN in the user’s home that is managed by a Fabric A with TBR1 (e.g. as a result of the above sequence diagram applied previously between Admin 1 and TBR1). The user installs a Matter-certified Thread Border Router (TBR2) to extend the Thread coverage and Internet access redundancy of Thread networks for their Matter devices.

![](media/image50.png)

> After installation, a single Thread PAN is shared by all Border Routers.

#### Share an existing PAN

> In this use case, there is already a PAN in the user’s home that is managed by Fabric A with TBR1 (e.g. as a result of the above sequence diagram applied previously between Admin 1 and TBR1). The user wants to use the Thread connectivity provided by the Matter-certified Thread Border Router managed by Fabric A with Fabric B to share its connectivity.
>
> ![](media/image51.png)
>
> After the installation, the Thread PAN is shared by Fabric A and B.
>
> Note: The user must use the Multiple Fabrics feature process between Fabrics A and B to onboard the Thread Border Router from Fabric A to Fabric B.

#### Merging to a new PAN

> This use case is a specific configuration where the user already has 2 PANs. One is managed by a Fabric A through a Matter Thread Border Router (TBR1) and the other is managed by a Fabric B through another Matter Thread Border Router (TBR2).
>
> The user wishes to merge the existing Thread connectivity provided by the two Matter certified Thread Border Routers to share their connectivity to extend the Thread coverage and Internet access redundancy of the Thread networks for their Matter devices.
>
> ![](media/image52.jpeg)
>
> After installation, the Thread PAN is shared between Fabrics A and B.
>
> Note 1 : Activation of the pending dataset is Thread stack dependent and propagation of the new dataset to all Matter devices may fail, for example if devices are disconnected during the process.
>
> Note 2 : This configuration should remain very rare if the previous installations followed the previ­ ous use cases.
