# Introduction

> The Matter Application Cluster specification defines generic interfaces that are sufficiently general to be of use across a wide range of application domains.

## Scope and Purpose

> This document specifies the Matter Application Cluster Library (MACL). The MACL is a repository for cluster functionality that is developed by the Connectivity Standards Alliance, and is a working library with regular updates as new functionality is added. A developer constructing a new applica­ tion should use the MACL to find relevant cluster functionality that can be incorporated into the new application. Correspondingly, new clusters that are defined for applications should be consid­ ered for inclusion in the MACL.
>
> The MACL consists of a number of sets of clusters. Clusters that are generally useful across many application domains are included in the General set. Clusters that are intended for use mainly in specific application domains are grouped together in domain oriented sets.

##### IdentifyTime Attribute

> This attribute SHALL represent the remaining length of time, in seconds, that the endpoint will con­ tinue to identify itself.
>
> If this attribute is set to a value other than 0 then the device SHALL enter its identification state, in order to indicate to an observer which of several nodes and/or endpoints it is. It is RECOMMENDED that this state consists of flashing a light with a period of 0.5 seconds. The IdentifyTime attribute SHALL be decremented every second while in this state.
>
> If this attribute reaches or is set to the value 0 then the device SHALL terminate its identification state.

##### IdentifyType Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate how the identification state is presented to the user.
>
> This attribute SHALL contain one of the values defined in [IdentifyTypeEnum](#identifytypeenum-type). The value None SHALL NOT be used if the device is capable of presenting its identification state using one of the other methods defined in [IdentifyTypeEnum](#identifytypeenum-type).

|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0x00 | **Identify** | client ⇒ server | Y | M | M |
| 0x40 | **TriggerEffect** | client ⇒ server | Y | M | O |

##### Identify Command

> This command starts or stops the receiving device identifying itself. This command SHALL have the following data fields:

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **Identify­ Time** | uint16 | all |  |  | M |

> **1.2.6.1.1. Effect on Receipt**
>
> On receipt of this command, the device SHALL set the IdentifyTime attribute to the value of the IdentifyTime field. This then starts, continues, or stops the device’s identification state as detailed in [IdentifyTime](#identifytime-attribute).

##### TriggerEffect Command

> This command allows the support of feedback to the user, such as a certain light effect. It is used to allow an implementation to provide visual feedback to the user under certain circumstances such as a color light turning green when it has successfully connected to a network. The use of this com­ mand and the effects themselves are entirely up to the implementer to use whenever a visual feed­ back is useful but it is not the same as and does not replace the identify mechanism used during commissioning.
>
> This command SHALL have the following data fields:

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **EffectIden­ tifier** | [EffectIdenti­](#effectidentifierenum-type) [fierEnum](#effectidentifierenum-type) | desc |  |  | M |
| 1 | **EffectVari­ ant** | [EffectVari­](#effectvariantenum-type) [antEnum](#effectvariantenum-type) | desc |  |  | M |

1.  **EffectIdentifier Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the identify effect to use and SHALL contain one of the non-reserved val­ ues in [EffectIdentifierEnum](#effectidentifierenum-type).
>
> All values of the [EffectIdentifierEnum](#effectidentifierenum-type) SHALL be supported. Implementors MAY deviate from the example light effects in [EffectIdentifierEnum](#effectidentifierenum-type), but they SHOULD indicate during testing how they handle each effect.

2.  **EffectVariant Field**

> This field SHALL indicate which variant of the effect, indicated in the EffectIdentifier field, SHOULD be triggered. If a device does not support the given variant, it SHALL use the default variant. This field SHALL contain one of the values in [EffectVariantEnum](#effectvariantenum-type).

3.  **Effect on Receipt**

> On receipt of this command, the device SHALL execute the trigger effect indicated in the EffectIden­ tifier and EffectVariant fields. If the EffectVariant field specifies a variant that is not supported on the device, it SHALL execute the default variant.

## Groups Cluster

> The Groups cluster manages, per endpoint, the content of the node-wide Group Table that is part of the underlying interaction layer.
>
> In a network supporting fabrics, group IDs referenced by attributes or other elements of this cluster are scoped to the accessing fabric.
>
> The Groups cluster is scoped to the endpoint. Groups cluster commands support discovering the endpoint membership in a group, adding the endpoint to a group, removing the endpoint from a group, removing endpoint membership from all groups. All commands defined in this cluster SHALL only affect groups scoped to the accessing fabric.
>
> When group names are supported, the server stores a name string, which is set by the client for each assigned group and indicated in response to a client request.
>
> Note that configuration of group addresses for outgoing commands is achieved using the Message Layer mechanisms where the Group Table is not involved. Hence this cluster does not play a part in that.

5.  **GroupName Field**

> This field MAY be set to a human-readable name for the group. If the client has no name for the group, the GroupName field SHALL be set to the empty string.
>
> Support of group names is optional and is indicated by the FeatureMap and NameSupport attribute.

6.  **Effect on Receipt**

> If the server does not support group names, the GroupName field SHALL be ignored.
>
> On receipt of the AddGroup command, the server SHALL perform the following procedure:

1.  If the command fields are not within constraints, the status SHALL be CONSTRAINT_ERROR, and the server continues from step 6.

2.  If the receiving node requires security material to support the group ID and that material does not exist for this group ID, the status SHALL be UNSUPPORTED_ACCESS and the server contin­ ues from step 6.

3.  If the server endpoint is a member of the group indicated by the GroupID, the group name SHALL be updated (if supported) to GroupName, the status SHALL be SUCCESS, and the server continues from step 6.

4.  If there are no available resources to add the membership for the server endpoint, the status SHALL be RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED, and the server continues from step 6.

5.  The server SHALL add the server endpoint as a member of the group indicated by the GroupID, the group name SHALL be updated (if supported) to GroupName, and the status SHALL be SUC­ CESS.

> a\. If the GroupID had already been added to the Group Table because of a previous AddGroup or AddGroupIfIdentifying command and a GroupName is provided and the server supports GroupName storage, then the GroupName associated with the GroupID in the Group Table SHALL be updated to reflect the new GroupName provided for the Group, such that subse­ quent ViewGroup commands yield the same name for all endpoints which have a group association to the given GroupID.

6.  If the AddGroup command was received as a unicast, the server SHALL generate an AddGroupResponse command with the Status field set to the evaluated status. If the AddGroup command was received as a groupcast, the server SHALL NOT generate an AddGroupResponse command.

> See [AddGroupResponse](#addgroupresponse-command) for a description of the response command.

> On receipt of the GetGroupMembership command, the server SHALL respond with group member­ ship information using the GetGroupMembershipResponse command as follows:
>
> If the GroupList field is empty, the server SHALL respond with all group IDs indicating the groups of which the server endpoint is a member.
>
> If the GroupList field contains at least one group ID indicating a group of which the server endpoint is a member, the server SHALL respond with each group ID indicating a group of which the server endpoint is a member that matches a group in the GroupList field.
>
> If the GroupList field contains one or more group IDs but does not contain any group ID indicating a group of which the server endpoint is a member, the server SHALL only respond if the command is unicast. The response SHALL return with an empty GroupList field.

##### RemoveGroup Command

> The RemoveGroup command allows a client to request that the server removes the membership for the server endpoint, if any, in a particular group.

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **GroupID** | group-id | min 1 |  |  | M |

9.  **Effect on Receipt**

> On receipt of the RemoveGroup command, the server SHALL perform the following procedure:

1.  If the command fields are not within constraints, the status SHALL be CONSTRAINT_ERROR and the server continues from step 4.

2.  If the server endpoint is a member of the group indicated by the GroupID, the server SHALL remove the server endpoint membership in the group, the status SHALL be SUCCESS, and the server continues from step 4.

3.  Else the status SHALL be NOT_FOUND.

4.  If the RemoveGroup command was received as a unicast, the server SHALL generate a Remove­ GroupResponse command with the Status field set to the evaluated status. If the RemoveGroup command was received as a groupcast, the server SHALL NOT generate a RemoveGroupRe­ sponse command.

> See [RemoveGroupResponse](#removegroupresponse-command) for a description of the response command.
>
> Additionally, if the Scenes Management cluster is supported on the same endpoint, scenes associ­ ated with the indicated group SHALL be removed on that endpoint.

##### RemoveAllGroups Command

> The RemoveAllGroups command allows a client to direct the server to remove all group associa­ tions for the server endpoint.

10. **Effect on Receipt**

> On receipt of this command, the server SHALL remove all group memberships for the server end­ point from the Group Table. If the RemoveAllGroups command was received as unicast and a response is not suppressed, the server SHALL generate a response with the Status field set to SUC­ CESS.
>
> Additionally, if the Scenes Management cluster is supported on the same endpoint, all scenes, except for scenes associated with group ID 0, SHALL be removed on that endpoint.

##### AddGroupIfIdentifying Command

> The AddGroupIfIdentifying command allows a client to add group membership in a particular group for the server endpoint, on condition that the endpoint is identifying itself. Identifying func­ tionality is controlled using the Identify cluster, (see [Identify Cluster](#identify-cluster)).
>
> For correct operation of the AddGroupIfIdentifying command, any endpoint that supports the Groups server cluster SHALL also support the Identify server cluster.
>
> This command might be used to assist configuring group membership in the absence of a commis­ sioning tool.

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **GroupID** | group-id | min 1 |  |  | M |
| 1 | **GroupName** | string | max 16 |  |  | M |

11. **GroupID Field**

> This field SHALL be used to identify the group and any associated key material to which the server endpoint is to be added.

12. **GroupName Field**

> This field MAY be set to a human-readable name for the group. If the client has no name for the
>
> group, the GroupName field SHALL be set to the empty string.
>
> Support of group names is optional and is indicated by the FeatureMap and NameSupport attribute.

13. **Effect on Receipt**

> If the server does not support group names, the GroupName field SHALL be ignored.
>
> On receipt of the AddGroupIfIdentifying command, the server SHALL perform the following proce­ dure:

1.  The server verifies that it is currently identifying itself. If the server it not currently identifying itself, the status SHALL be SUCCESS, and the server continues from step 7.

2.  If the command fields are not within constraints, the status SHALL be CONSTRAINT_ERROR and the server continues from step 7.

3.  If the receiving node requires security material to support the group ID, and that material does not exist for this group ID, the status SHALL be UNSUPPORTED_ACCESS and the server contin­ ues from step 7.

4.  If the server endpoint is a member of the group indicated by the GroupID, the status SHALL be SUCCESS and the server continues from step 7.

5.  If there are no available resources to add the membership for the server endpoint, the status SHALL be RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED and the server continues from step 7.

6.  The server SHALL add the server endpoint as a member of the group indicated by the GroupID, the group name SHALL be updated (if supported) to GroupName, and the status SHALL be SUC­ CESS.

> a\. If the GroupID had already been added to the Group Table because of a previous AddGroup or AddGroupIfIdentifying command and a GroupName is provided and the server supports GroupName storage, then the GroupName associated with the GroupID in the Group Table SHALL be updated to reflect the new GroupName provided for the Group, such that subse­ quent ViewGroup commands yield the same name for all endpoints which have a group association to the given GroupID.

7.  If the AddGroupIfIdentifying command was received as unicast and the evaluated status is not SUCCESS, or if the AddGroupIfIdentifying command was received as unicast and the evaluated status is SUCCESS and a response is not suppressed, the server SHALL generate a response with the Status field set to the evaluated status.

##### AddGroupResponse Command

> The AddGroupResponse is sent by the Groups cluster server in response to an AddGroup command.

##### GetGroupMembershipResponse Command

> The GetGroupMembershipResponse command is sent by the Groups cluster server in response to a GetGroupMembership command.
>
> The GetGroupMembershipResponse command SHALL have the following data fields:

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **Capacity** | uint8 | all | X |  | M |
| 1 | **GroupList** | list\[group-id\] | all\[min 1\] |  |  | M |

17. **Capacity Field**

> This field SHALL contain the remaining capacity of the Group Table of the node. The following val­ ues apply:

- 0 - No further groups MAY be added.

- 0 \< Capacity \< 0xFE - Capacity holds the number of groups that MAY be added.

- 0xFE - At least 1 further group MAY be added (exact number is unknown).

- null - It is unknown if any further groups MAY be added.

  1.  **GroupList Field**

> The GroupList field SHALL contain either the group IDs of all the groups in the Group Table for which the server endpoint is a member of the group (in the case where the GroupList field of the received GetGroupMembership command was empty), or the group IDs of all the groups in the Group Table for which the server endpoint is a member of the group *and* for which the group ID was included in the the GroupList field of the received GetGroupMembership command (in the case where the GroupList field of the received GetGroupMembership command was not empty).
>
> Zigbee: If the total number of groups will cause the maximum payload length of a frame to be exceeded, then the GroupList field SHALL contain only as many groups as will fit.

##### RemoveGroupResponse Command

> The RemoveGroupResponse command is generated by the server in response to the receipt of a RemoveGroup command.

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |

3.  **GroupID Field**

> This field is set to the GroupID field of the received RemoveGroup command.

## 1.4. Scenes Management Cluster

> The Scenes Management cluster provides attributes and commands for setting up and recalling scenes. Each scene corresponds to a set of stored values of specified attributes for one or more clus­ ters on the same end point as the Scenes Management cluster.
>
> In most cases scenes are associated with a particular group identifier. Scenes MAY also exist with­ out a group, in which case the value 0 replaces the group identifier. Note that extra care is required in these cases to avoid a scene identifier collision, and that commands related to scenes without a group MAY only be unicast, i.e., they SHALL NOT be multicast or broadcast.
>
> **NOTE** Support for Scenes Management cluster is provisional.

### Revision History

> The global ClusterRevision attribute value SHALL be the highest revision number in the table below.

| **Revision** | **Description** |
|----|----|
| 1 | Based on the ZCL Scenes Cluster, Updated the Cluster ID to 0x0062, the name to Scenes Man­ agement, removed the provisional status; Removed attributes SceneCount, CurrentScene, CurrentGroup, SceneValid, and NameSupport; Removed Explicit, TableSize and FabricScenes features; Removed EnhancedAddScene, EnhancedAddSceneResponse, Enhanced­ ViewScene, EnhancedViewSceneResponse; Tran­ sitionTime field changed milliseconds in AddScene, ViewSceneResponse and RecallScene |

### Features

> This cluster SHALL support the FeatureMap bitmap attribute as defined below.

| **Bit** | **Code** | **Feature** | **Conformance** | **Summary** |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **SN** | SceneNames | O | The ability to store a name for a scene. |

> The following sections describe each feature in some detail. Further details are found within the specification.

##### SceneNames Feature

> This feature indicates the ability to store a name for a scene when a scene is added.

### Dependencies

> Any endpoint that implements the Scenes Management server cluster SHALL also implement the Groups server cluster.
>
> Note that the [RemoveGroup command](#removegroup-command) and the [RemoveAllGroups command](#removeallgroups-command) of the [Groups cluster](#groups-cluster) also remove scenes.

### Handling of fabric-scoping

> Attributes and commands for this cluster are scoped to the accessing fabric and SHALL only affect or reflect data related to the accessing fabric, with the exception of the [SceneValid Field](#_bookmark70) of the Fab­ ricSceneInfo attribute.
>
> The following constraints apply in addition to any other stated requirements in individual data model elements:

- Any attribute read, attribute write or command invoked on the server when no accessing fabric is available SHALL fail with a status code of UNSUPPORTED_ACCESS returned to the client.

- When accessing scene information, implementations SHALL ensure that scenes with identical Group ID and Scene ID across fabrics will only access the data for the accessing fabric, so that the same identifier values used by different accessing fabrics do not cause mixing or overwrit­ ing of another fabric’s scenes.

- Upon leaving a fabric with the RemoveFabric command of the Operational Credentials Cluster, all scenes data for the associated fabric SHALL be removed from the Scene Table.

- The Scene Table capacity for a given fabric SHALL be less than half (rounded down towards 0) of the Scene Table entries (as indicated in the SceneTableSize attribute), with a maximum of 253 entries (to allow expressing it in the GetSceneMembershipResponse command). If the Scene Ta­ ble capacity is about to be exceeded by adding or storing a scene, then the resource exhaustion behavior of the associated command SHALL apply.

### Data Types

##### CopyModeBitmap Type

| 4 | **Remain­ ingCapac­ ity** | uint8 | max 253 |  | MS |  | M |

1.  **SceneCount Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the number of scenes currently used in the server’s Scene Table on the endpoint where the Scenes Management cluster appears.
>
> This only includes the count for the associated fabric.

2.  **CurrentScene Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the scene identifier of the scene last invoked on the associated fabric. If no scene has been invoked, the value of this field SHALL be 0xFF, the undefined scene identifier.

3.  **CurrentGroup Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the group identifier of the scene last invoked on the associated fabric, or 0 if the scene last invoked is not associated with a group.

4.  **SceneValid Field**

> This field SHALL indicate whether the state of the server corresponds to that associated with the CurrentScene and CurrentGroup fields of the SceneInfoStruct they belong to. TRUE indicates that these fields are valid, FALSE indicates that they are not valid.
>
> This field SHALL be set to False for all other fabrics when an attribute with the Scenes ("S") designa­ tion in the Quality column of another cluster present on the same endpoint is modified or when the current scene is modified by a fabric through the [RecallScene](#recallscene-command) or [StoreScene](#storescene-command) commands, regardless of the fabric-scoped access quality of the command.
>
> In the event where the SceneValid field is set to False for a fabric, the CurrentScene and Current­ Group fields SHALL be the last invoked scene and group for that fabric. In the event where no scene was previously invoked for that fabric, the CurrentScene and CurrentGroup fields SHALL be their default values.

5.  **RemainingCapacity Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the remaining capacity of the [Scene Table](#logical-scene-table) on this endpoint for the access­ ing fabric. Note that this value may change between reads, even if no entries are added or deleted on the accessing fabric, due to other clients associated with other fabrics adding or deleting entries that impact the resource usage on the device.

##### AttributeValuePairStruct Type

> This data type indicates a combination of an identifier and the value of an attribute.

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Access** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|

1.  **AttributeID Field**

> This field SHALL be present for all instances in a given [ExtensionFieldSetStruct](#extensionfieldsetstruct-type).
>
> Which Value\* field is used SHALL be determined based on the data type of the attribute indicated by AttributeID, as described in [the Value\* Fields subsection](#_bookmark72).
>
> The AttributeID field SHALL NOT refer to an attribute without the Scenes ("S") designation in the Quality column of the cluster specification.

2.  **ValueUnsigned8, ValueSigned8, ValueUnsigned16, ValueSigned16, ValueUnsigned32, ValueSigned32, ValueUnsigned64, ValueSigned64 Fields**

> These fields SHALL indicate the attribute value as part of an extension field set, associated with a given AttributeID under an ExtensionFieldSetStruct’s ClusterID. Which of the fields is used SHALL
>
> be determined by the type of the attribute indicated by AttributeID as follows:

- Data types bool, map8, and uint8 SHALL map to ValueUnsigned8.

- Data types int8 SHALL map to ValueSigned8.

- Data types map16 and uint16 SHALL map to ValueUnsigned16.

- Data types int16 SHALL map to ValueSigned16.

- Data types map32, uint24, and uint32 SHALL map to ValueUnsigned32.

- Data types int24 and int32 SHALL map to ValueSigned32.

- Data types map64, uint40, uint48, uint56 and uint64 SHALL map to ValueUnsigned64.

- Data types int40, int48, int56 and int64 SHALL map to ValueSigned64.

- For derived types, the mapping SHALL be based on the base type. For example, an attribute of type percent SHALL be treated as if it were of type uint8, whereas an attribute of type per­ cent100ths SHALL be treated as if it were of type uint16.

- For boolean nullable attributes, any value that is not 0 or 1 SHALL be considered to have the null value.

- For boolean non-nullable attributes, any value that is not 0 or 1 SHALL be considered to have the value FALSE.

- For non-boolean nullable attributes, any value that is not a valid numeric value for the attribute’s type after accounting for range reductions due to being nullable and constraints SHALL be considered to have the null value for the type.

- For non-boolean non-nullable attributes, any value that is not a valid numeric value for the attribute’s type after accounting for constraints SHALL be considered to be the valid attribute value that is closest to the provided value.

  - In the event that an invalid provided value is of equal numerical distance to the two closest valid values, the lowest of those values SHALL be considered the closest valid attribute value.

> If the used field does not match the data type of the attribute indicated by AttributeID, the Attribut­ eValuePairStruct SHALL be considered invalid.
>
> Examples of processing are:

- ColorControl cluster CurrentX (AttributeID 0x0003) has a type of uint16 and is not nullable.

  - ValueUnsigned16 of 0xAB12 would be used as-is, as it is in range.

  - ValueUnsigned16 of 0xFF80 is outside of the range allowed for attribute CurrentX, and would be saturated to the closest valid value, which is the maximum of the attribute’s con­ straint range: 0xFEFF.

- LevelControl cluster CurrentLevel (AttributeID 0x0000) has a type of uint8 and is nullable.

  - ValueUnsigned8 of 0xA1 would be used as-is, as it is in range.

  - ValueUnsigned8 of 0xFF is outside the range allowed for nullable attribute CurrentLevel, and would be considered as the null value.

##### ExtensionFieldSetStruct Type

> This data type indicates for a given cluster a set of attributes and their values.

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Access** | **Confor­ mance** |

1.  **ClusterID Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the cluster-id of the cluster whose attributes are in the AttributeValueList field.

2.  **AttributeValueList Field**

> This field SHALL indicate a set of attributes and their values which are stored as part of a scene.
>
> Attributes which do not have the Scenes ("S") designation in the Quality column of their cluster specification SHALL NOT be used in the AttributeValueList field.

3.  **Form of ExtensionFieldSetStruct**

> The AttributeValuePairStructs in the AttributeValueList MAY be in any order.
>
> The AttributeValueList SHOULD contain all the attributes with the Scenes ("S") quality as the specifi­ cation of the cluster identified by ClusterID describes, but AttributeValuePairStruct MAY be omitted.
>
> An example using the Color Control cluster:

- Attribute 0x0001, CurrentSaturation, S quality, optional, implemented

- Attribute 0x0003, CurrentX, S quality, optional based on feature, implemented

- Attribute 0x0004, CurrentY, S quality, optional based on feature, implemented

- Attribute 0x0007, ColorTemperatureMireds, S quality, optional based on feature, implemented

- Attribute 0x4000, EnhancedCurrentHue, S quality, optional based on feature, implemented

- Attribute 0x4001, EnhancedColorMode, S quality, mandatory, implemented

- Attribute 0x4002, ColorLoopActive, S quality, optional based on feature, NOT implemented

- Attribute 0x4003, ColorLoopDirection, S quality, optional based on feature, NOT implemented

- Attribute 0x4004, ColorLoopTime, S quality, optional based on feature, NOT implemented

> An ExtensionFieldSetStruct containing an invalid AttributeValuePairStruct SHALL be considered invalid.

##### Logical Scene Table

> The Scene Table is used to store information for each scene capable of being invoked on the server. Each scene is defined for a particular group. The Scene Table is defined here as a conceptual illus­ tration to assist in understanding the underlying data to be stored when scenes are defined. Though the Scene Table is defined here using the data model architecture rules and format, the design is not normative.
>
> The Scene table is logically a list of fabric-scoped structs. The logical fields of each Scene Table entry struct are illustrated below. An ExtensionFieldSetStruct MAY be present for each Scenes-supporting cluster implemented on the same endpoint.

| **Quality: Fabric Scoped** |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

4.  **SceneGroupID Field**

> This field is the group identifier for which this scene applies, or 0 if the scene is not associated with a group.

5.  **SceneID Field**

> This field is unique within this group, which is used to identify this scene.

6.  **SceneName Field**

> The field is the name of the scene.
>
> If scene names are not supported, any commands that write a scene name SHALL simply discard the name, and any command that returns a scene name SHALL return an empty string.

7.  **SceneTransitionTime Field**

> This field is the amount of time, in milliseconds, it will take for a cluster to change from its current state to the requested state.

8.  **ExtensionFields Field**

> See the Scene Table Extensions subsections of individual clusters. A Scene Table Extension SHALL only use attributes with the Scene quality. Each ExtensionFieldSetStruct holds a set of values of these attributes for a cluster implemented on the same endpoint where the Scene ("S") designation appears in the quality column. A scene is the aggregate of all such fields across all clusters on the endpoint.

### Attributes

##### LastConfiguredBy Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the Node ID of the node that last configured the Scene Table.
>
> The null value indicates that the server has not been configured, or that the identifier of the node that last configured the Scenes Management cluster is not known.
>
> The Node ID is scoped to the accessing fabric.

##### SceneTableSize Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the number of entries in the [Scene Table](#logical-scene-table) on this endpoint. This is the total across all fabrics; note that a single fabric cannot use all those entries (see [Handling of fabric-](#handling-of-fabric-scoping) [scoping](#handling-of-fabric-scoping)). The minimum size of this table, (i.e., the minimum number of scenes to support across all fabrics per endpoint) SHALL be 16, unless a device type in which this cluster is used, defines a larger value in the device type definition.

##### FabricSceneInfo Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate a list of fabric scoped information about scenes on this endpoint.
>
> The number of list entries for this attribute SHALL NOT exceed the number of supported fabrics by the device.

> It is not mandatory for an extension field set to be included in the command for every cluster on that endpoint that has a defined extension field set. Extension field sets MAY be omitted, including the case of no extension field sets at all.

1.  **GroupID Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the group identifier in the Group Table.

2.  **SceneID Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the scene identifier in the Scene Table.

3.  **TransitionTime Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the transition time of the scene, measured in milliseconds.

4.  **SceneName Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the name of the scene.

5.  **ExtensionFieldSetStructs Field**

> This field SHALL contains the list of extension fields.

6.  **Effect on Receipt**

> On receipt of this command, the server SHALL perform the following procedure:

1.  If the value of the GroupID field is non-zero, the server verifies that the endpoint has an entry for that GroupID in the Group Table. If there is no such entry in the Group Table, the status SHALL be INVALID_COMMAND and the server continues from step 5.

2.  If the ExtensionFieldSetStructs list is formatted in a way deemed invalid according to the Exten­ sionFieldSetStruct structure definition (see [ExtensionFieldSetStruct](#extensionfieldsetstruct-type)), then the status SHALL be INVALID_COMMAND in the AddSceneResponse, and the server continues from step 5.

3.  If a scene already exists under the same group/scene identifier pair, in step 4 the already exist­ ing scene entry SHALL be replaced with the new scene being added. Otherwise, if a scene can­ not be created due to the lack of Scene Table capacity for the given fabric, the status SHALL be RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED and the server continues from step 5.

4.  The server adds the scene entry into its Scene Table with fields copied from the AddScene com­ mand data fields and the status SHALL be SUCCESS.

    1.  Any ExtensionFieldSetStruct referencing a ClusterID that is not implemented on the end­ point MAY be omitted during processing.

    2.  Any AttributeValuePairStruct referencing an AttributeID from the referenced cluster that is not implemented on the endpoint MAY be omitted during processing.

    3.  If the ExtensionFieldSetStructs list has multiple entries listing the same ClusterID, the last one within the list SHALL be the one recorded.

    4.  Within a single entry of the ExtensionFieldSetStructs list, if an ExtensionFieldSet contains the same AttributeID more than once, the last one within the ExtensionFieldSet SHALL be the one recorded.

5.  If the AddScene command was received as a unicast, the server SHALL then generate an AddSceneResponse command with the Status field set to the evaluated status.

> The SceneTransitionTime field of the Scene Table SHALL be updated with the value of the Transi­ tionTime.

3.  **TransitionTime Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the transition time of the scene, measured in milliseconds.

4.  **Effect on Receipt**

> On receipt of this command, the server SHALL perform the following procedure:

1.  If the value of the GroupID field is non-zero, the server verifies that the endpoint has an entry for that GroupID in the Group Table. If there is no such entry in the Group Table, the status SHALL be INVALID_COMMAND and the server continues from step 4.

2.  The server verifies that the scene entry corresponding to the GroupID and SceneID fields exists in its Scene Table. If there is no such entry in its Scene Table, the status SHALL be NOT_FOUND and the server continues from step 4.

3.  The server retrieves the requested scene entry from its Scene Table. For each other cluster implemented on the endpoint, it SHALL retrieve any corresponding extension field sets from the Scene Table and set the attributes and corresponding state of the cluster accordingly. If there is no extension field set for a cluster, the state of that cluster SHALL remain unchanged. If an extension field set omits the values of any attributes, the values of these attributes SHALL remain unchanged. If an extension field set would cause an unknown or missing attribute to be set for any reason, that attribute SHALL be skipped. The status SHALL be SUCCESS.

4.  If the RecallScene command was received as a unicast, the server SHALL then generate a response with the Status field set to the evaluated status.

> If the TransitionTime data field is present in the command and its value is not equal to null, this field SHALL indicate the transition time in milliseconds. In all other cases (command data field not present or value equal to null), the SceneTransitionTime field of the Scene Table entry SHALL indi­ cate the transition time. The transition time determines how long the transition takes from the old cluster state to the new cluster state. It is recommended that, where possible (e.g., it is not possible for attributes with Boolean data type), a gradual transition SHOULD take place from the old to the new state over this time. However, the exact transition algorithm is implementation-defined.

9.  **Effect on Receipt**

> On receipt of this command, the server SHALL perform the following procedure:

1.  If the value of either the GroupIdentifierFrom field or the Group Identifier To field is non-zero, the server verifies that the endpoint has an entry for these non-zero group identifiers in the Group Table. If there are no such entries in the Group Table, the status SHALL be INVALID\_­ COMMAND and the server continues from step 5.

2.  If the CopyAllScenes sub-field of the Mode field is set to 0, the server verifies that the scene entry corresponding to the GroupIdentifierFrom and SceneIdentifierFrom fields exists in its Scene Table. If there is no such entry in its Scene Table, the status SHALL be NOT_FOUND and the server continues from step 5.

3.  If the CopyAllScenes sub-field of the Mode field is set to 1, the server SHALL copy all its avail­ able scenes with group identifier equal to the GroupIdentifierFrom field under the group identi­ fier specified in the GroupIdentifierTo field, leaving the scene identifiers the same. In this case, the SceneIdentifierFrom and SceneIdentifierTo fields SHALL be ignored.

> If the CopyAllScenes sub-field of the Mode field is set to 0, the server SHALL copy the Scene Ta­ ble entry corresponding to the GroupIdentifierFrom and SceneIdentifierFrom fields to the Scene Table entry corresponding to the GroupIdentifierTo and SceneIdentifierTo fields.
>
> Regardless of the value of the CopyAllScenes subfield, if a scene already exists under the same group/scene identifier pair, it SHALL be replaced with the scene being copied.
>
> Regardless of the value of the CopyAllScenes subfield, if a scene cannot be copied due to the lack of Scene Table capacity for the given fabric, the status SHALL be RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED and the server continues from step 5. In this case, scenes already copied SHALL be kept.

##### Lighting Feature

> This cluster is used for a lighting application.
>
> On receipt of a Level Control cluster command that causes the OnOff attribute to be set to FALSE, the OnTime attribute SHALL be set to 0.
>
> On receipt of a Level Control cluster command that causes the OnOff attribute to be set to TRUE, if the value of the OnTime attribute is equal to 0, the server SHALL set the OffWaitTime attribute to 0.

##### DeadFrontBehavior Feature

> When this feature is supported, the device exposing this server cluster exhibits "dead front" behav­ ior when the "OnOff" attribute is FALSE (Off). This "dead front" behavior includes:

- clusters other than this cluster that are also exposed MAY respond with failures to Invoke and Write interactions. Such failure responses when in a "dead front" SHALL be with an INVALID_IN_STATE status code.

- clusters other than this cluster MAY change the values of their attributes to best-effort values, due to the actual values not being defined or available in this state. Device type specifications that require support for the DF feature SHOULD define what these best-effort values are.

- Report Transactions SHALL continue to be generated. Such transactions MAY include best-effort values as noted above.

- Event generation logic for clusters other than this cluster is unchanged (noting possible use of best-effort attribute values as in the preceding bullets).

> When this feature is supported and the OnOff attribute changes from TRUE to FALSE (e.g. when receiving an Off Command, or due to a manual interaction on the device), it SHALL start executing this "dead front" behavior.
>
> When this feature is supported and the OnOff attribute changes from FALSE to TRUE (e.g. when receiving an On Command, or due to a manual interaction on the device), it SHALL stop executing this "dead front" behavior.
>
> When this feature is supported, and any change of the "dead front" state leads to changes in attrib­ utes of other clusters due to the "dead front" feature, these attribute changes SHALL NOT be skipped or omitted from the usual processing associated with attribute changes. For example, if an attribute changes from value 4 to null on "dead front" behavior due to an Off command being received, this change SHALL be processed for reporting and subscriptions.

##### OffOnly Feature

> When this feature is supported, the [Off](#off-command) command SHALL be supported and the [On](#on-command) and [Toggle](#toggle-command) com­ mands SHALL NOT be supported.
>
> This feature is useful for devices which can be turned off via the [Off](#off-command) command received by an instance of this cluster but cannot be turned on via commands received by an instance of this clus­ ter due to regulatory requirements.

##### Scene Table Extensions

> If the Scenes Management server cluster is implemented on the same endpoint, the following attribute SHALL be part of the ExtensionFieldSetStruct of the Scene Table.

- OnOff

##### OnOff Attribute

> This attribute indicates whether the device type implemented on the endpoint is turned off or turned on, in these cases the value of the OnOff attribute equals FALSE, or TRUE respectively.

##### GlobalSceneControl Attribute

> In order to support the use case where the user gets back the last setting of a set of devices (e.g. level settings for lights), a global scene is introduced which is stored when the devices are turned off and recalled when the devices are turned on. The global scene is defined as the scene that is stored with group identifier 0 and scene identifier 0.
>
> This attribute is defined in order to prevent a second Off command storing the all-devices-off situa­ tion as a global scene, and to prevent a second On command destroying the current settings by going back to the global scene.
>
> This attribute SHALL be set to TRUE after the reception of a command which causes the OnOff attribute to be set to TRUE, such as a standard On command, a MoveToLevel(WithOnOff) command, a RecallScene command or a [OnWithRecallGlobalScene](#onwithrecallglobalscene-command) command.
>
> This attribute is set to FALSE after reception of a OffWithEffect command.
>
> These concepts are illustrated in [Explanation of the Behavior of Store and Recall Global Scene func­](#_bookmark100) [tionality using a State Diagram](#_bookmark100).

>
> Note 1: Any command which causes the OnOff attribute to be set to TRUE except OnWithRecallGlobalScene, e.g. On or Toggle.
>
> *Figure 1. Explanation of the Behavior of Store and Recall Global Scene functionality using a State Diagram*

##### OnTime Attribute

> This attribute specifies the length of time (in 1/10ths second) that the On state SHALL be maintained before automatically transitioning to the Off state when using the OnWithTimedOff command. This attribute can be written at any time, but writing a value only has effect when in the Timed On state. See [OnWithTimedOff](#onwithtimedoff-command) for more details.

##### OffWaitTime Attribute

> This attribute specifies the length of time (in 1/10ths second) that the Off state SHALL be guarded to prevent another OnWithTimedOff command turning the server back to its On state (e.g., when leav­ ing a room, the lights are turned off but an occupancy sensor detects the leaving person and attempts to turn the lights back on). This attribute can be written at any time, but writing a value only has an effect when in the Timed On state followed by a transition to the Delayed Off state, or in the Delayed Off state. See [OnWithTimedOff](#onwithtimedoff-command) for more details.

##### StartUpOnOff Attribute

> This attribute SHALL define the desired startup behavior of a device when it is supplied with power and this state SHALL be reflected in the OnOff attribute. If the value is null, the OnOff attribute is set to its previous value. Otherwise, the behavior is defined in the table defining [StartUpOnOf­](#startuponoffenum-type) [fEnum](#startuponoffenum-type).
>
> This behavior does not apply to reboots associated with OTA. After an OTA restart, the OnOff attribute SHALL return to its value prior to the restart.

If the value of the OnOff attribute is equal to TRUE, the server SHALL set the OnTime attribute to 0.

##### OffWithEffect Command

> The OffWithEffect command allows devices to be turned off using enhanced ways of fading. The OffWithEffect command SHALL have the following data fields:

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|

3.  **Effect on Receipt**

> On receipt of the OffWithEffect command the server SHALL check the value of the GlobalSceneCon­ trol attribute.
>
> If the GlobalSceneControl attribute is equal to TRUE, the server SHALL store its settings in its global scene then set the GlobalSceneControl attribute to FALSE, then set the OnOff attribute to FALSE and if the OnTime attribute is supported set the OnTime attribute to 0.
>
> If the GlobalSceneControl attribute is equal to FALSE, the server SHALL only set the OnOff attribute to FALSE.

>
> On receipt of the OnWithRecallGlobalScene command, if the GlobalSceneControl attribute is equal to TRUE, the server SHALL discard the command.
>
> If the GlobalSceneControl attribute is equal to FALSE, the Scenes Management cluster server on the same endpoint SHALL recall its global scene, updating the OnOff attribute accordingly. The OnOff server SHALL then set the GlobalSceneControl attribute to TRUE.
>
> Additionally, when the OnTime and OffWaitTime attributes are both supported, if the value of the OnTime attribute is equal to 0, the server SHALL set the OffWaitTime attribute to 0.

##### OnWithTimedOff Command

> This command allows devices to be turned on for a specific duration with a guarded off duration so that SHOULD the device be subsequently turned off, further OnWithTimedOff commands, received during this time, are prevented from turning the devices back on. Further OnWithTimedOff com­ mands received while the server is turned on, will update the period that the device is turned on.
>
> The OnWithTimedOff command SHALL have the following data fields:

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **OnOffCon­ trol** | [OnOffCon­](#onoffcontrolbitmap-type) [trolBitmap](#onoffcontrolbitmap-type) | 0 to 1 |  |  | M |

##### AcceptOnlyWhenOn Bit

> This bit specifies whether the OnWithTimedOff command is to be processed unconditionally or only when the OnOff attribute is equal to TRUE. If this sub-field is set to 1, the OnWithTimedOff command SHALL only be accepted if the OnOff attribute is equal to TRUE. If this sub-field is set to 0, the OnWithTimedOff command SHALL be processed unconditionally.

2.  **OnTime Field**

> This field is used to adjust the value of the OnTime attribute.

3.  **OffWaitTime Field**

> This field is used to adjust the value of the OffWaitTime attribute.

4.  **Effect on Receipt**

> On receipt of this command, if the AcceptOnlyWhenOn sub-field of the OnOffControl field is set to 1, and the value of the OnOff attribute is equal to FALSE, the command SHALL be discarded.
>
> If the value of the OffWaitTime attribute is greater than zero and the value of the OnOff attribute is equal to FALSE, then the server SHALL set the OffWaitTime attribute to the minimum of the OffWaitTime attribute and the value specified in the OffWaitTime field.
>
> In all other cases, the server SHALL set the OnTime attribute to the maximum of the OnTime attribute and the value specified in the OnTime field, set the OffWaitTime attribute to the value
>
> specified in the OffWaitTime field and set the OnOff attribute to TRUE.
>
> If the values of the OnTime and OffWaitTime attributes are both not equal to 0xFFFF, the server SHALL then update these attributes every 1/10^(th) second until both the OnTime and OffWaitTime attributes are equal to 0, as follows:

- If the value of the OnOff attribute is equal to TRUE and the value of the OnTime attribute is greater than zero, the server SHALL decrement the value of the OnTime attribute. If the value of the OnTime attribute reaches 0, the server SHALL set the OffWaitTime and OnOff attributes to 0 and FALSE, respectively.

- If the value of the OnOff attribute is equal to FALSE and the value of the OffWaitTime attribute is greater than zero, the server SHALL decrement the value of the OffWaitTime attribute. If the value of the OffWaitTime attribute reaches 0, the server SHALL terminate the update.

### State Description

> The operation of the On/Off cluster with respect to the On, Off, and OnWithTimedOff commands is illustrated in [On/Off Cluster Operation State Machine](#_bookmark109). In this diagram, the values X and Y corre­ spond to the OnTime and OffWaitTime fields, respectively, of the OnWithTimedOff command. In the Timed On state, the OnTime attribute is decremented every 1/10^(th) second, unless its value equals 0xFFFF. Similarly, in the Delayed Off state, the OffWaitTime attribute is decremented every 1/10^(th) second, unless its value equals 0xFFFF.
>
> OnWithTimedOff(x,y) / OnTime:=**max**(x,OnTime); OffWaitTime:=y;
>
> OnWithTimedOff(x,y) / OffWaitTime:=**min**(y,OffWaitTime);
>
> Off1 : Any command which causes the OnOff attribute to be set to FALSE, e.g. Off, Toggle or OffWithEffect.
>
> On2 : Any command which causes the OnOff attribute to be set to TRUE, e.g. On, Toggle or OnWithRecallGlobalScene.

| **Bit** | **Code** | **Feature** | **Default** | **Conformance** | **Summary** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **OO** | OnOff | 1 | O | Dependency with the On/Off cluster |
| 1 | **LT** | Lighting | 0 | O | Behavior that supports light­ ing applica­ tions |
| 2 | **FQ** | Frequency | 0 | P | Supports fre­ quency attrib­ utes and behavior. |

> The following sections describe each feature in some detail. Further details are found within the specification.

##### On/Off Feature

> For many applications, a close relationship between this cluster and the On/Off cluster is needed. This section describes the dependencies that are required when an endpoint that implements this server cluster and also implements the On/Off server cluster. Before the On/Off feature bit in the FeatureMap existed, there was a dependency between this cluster and the On/Off cluster.
>
> The OnOff attribute of the On/Off cluster and the CurrentLevel attribute of the Level Control cluster are intrinsically independent variables, as they are on different clusters. However, when both clus­ ters are implemented on the same endpoint, dependencies MAY be introduced between them. Facil­ ities are provided to introduce dependencies if required.

1.  **Effect of On/Off Commands on the CurrentLevel attribute**

> The [OnLevel](#onlevel-attribute) attribute determines whether commands of the On/Off cluster have a permanent effect on the CurrentLevel attribute or not. If this attribute is defined (i.e., implemented and not equal to null) they do have a permanent effect, otherwise they do not. There is always a temporary effect, due to fading up / down.
>
> The effect on the Level Control cluster on receipt of the various commands of the On/Off cluster are as detailed in the [Effect of On/Off Commands when associated with Level Control](#_bookmark116) table. In this ta­ ble, and throughout this cluster specification, 'level' means the value of the CurrentLevel attribute.
>
> *Table 2. Effect of On/Off Commands when associated with Level Control*

[TABLE]

> Intention of the actions described in the table above is that CurrentLevel, which was in effect before any of the On, Off or Toggle commands were issued, SHALL be restored, after the transition is completed. If another of these commands is received, before the transition is completed, the orig­ inally stored CurrentLevel SHALL be preserved and restored.

2.  **Effect of Level Control Commands on the OnOff Attribute**

> There are two sets of commands provided in the Level Control cluster. These are identical, except that the first set (MoveToLevel, Move and Step commands) SHALL NOT affect the OnOff attribute, whereas the second set ('with On/Off' variants) SHALL.
>
> The first set is used to maintain independence between the CurrentLevel and OnOff attributes, so changing CurrentLevel has no effect on the OnOff attribute. As examples, this represents the behav­ ior of a volume control with a separate mute button, or a 'turn to set level and press to turn on/off' light dimmer.
>
> The second set is used to link the CurrentLevel and OnOff attributes. When the level is reduced to its minimum the OnOff attribute is automatically turned to FALSE, and when the level is increased above its minimum the OnOff attribute is automatically turned to TRUE. As an example, this repre­ sents the behavior of a light dimmer with no independent on/off switch.
>
> For the Stop command, the StopWithOnOff is included solely for symmetry, to allow easy choice of one or other set of commands – both Stop commands are identical, because the dependency on On/Off is determined by the original command that is being stopped.

3.  **Effect of Level Control Commands Depends on OnOff**

> Before the Options attribute was introduced, all commands except those postfixed with ‘with On/Off’, had no effect if the OnOff attribute of the On/Off cluster, on the same endpoint, was FALSE. Even if the On/Off (OO) feature set bit is set to zero, this is still true. To allow such commands to function, please see the Options attribute below.

4.  **GlobalSceneControl and Commands with On/Off**

> If a MoveToLevel(WithOnOff), Move(WithOnOff) or Step(WithOnOff) command is received that causes a change to the value of the OnOff attribute of the On/Off cluster, the value of the Glob­ alSceneControl attribute of the On/Off cluster SHALL be updated according to section [Glob­](#globalscenecontrol-attribute) [alSceneControl](#globalscenecontrol-attribute).

##### Lighting Feature

> This feature supports an interface for controlling the level of a light source. For the CurrentLevel attribute:
>
> A value of 0x00 SHALL NOT be used.
>
> A value of 0x01 SHALL indicate the minimum level that can be attained on a device. A value of 0xFE SHALL indicate the maximum level that can be attained on a device. A value of null SHALL represent an undefined value.
>
> All other values are application specific gradations from the minimum to the maximum level.

##### Frequency Feature

> **NOTE** The Frequency feature is provisional.

##### Scene Table Extensions

> If the Scenes Management server cluster is implemented on the same endpoint, the following attributes SHALL be part of the ExtensionFieldSetStruct of the Scene Table. If the implicit form of the ExtensionFieldSetStruct is used, the order of the attributes in the AttributeValueList is in the given order, i.e., the attribute listed as 1 is added first:

1.  CurrentLevel

2.  CurrentFrequency

> Attributes in the scene table that are not supported by the device (according to the FeatureMap
>
> attribute) SHALL be present in the scene table but ignored. An extension field set value outside of the accepted values of the corresponding MoveTo\<Target\> command, e.g. a null value for the Cur­ rentLevel attribute, corresponding to the MoveToLevel command, SHALL be ignored.

##### CurrentLevel Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the current level of this device. The meaning of 'level' is device dependent.
>
> Changes to this attribute SHALL only be marked as reportable in the following cases:

- At the end of the movement/transition, or

- When it changes from null to any other value and vice versa.

##### RemainingTime Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the time remaining until the current command is complete - it is specified in 1/10ths of a second.
>

- When it changes from 0 to any value higher than 10, or

- When it changes, with a delta larger than 10, caused by the invoke of a command, or

- When it changes to 0.

> For commands with a transition time or changes to the transition time less than 1 second, changes to this attribute SHALL NOT be reported.
>
> As this attribute is not being reported during a regular countdown, clients SHOULD NOT rely on the reporting of this attribute in order to keep track of the remaining duration.

##### MinLevel Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the minimum value of CurrentLevel that is capable of being assigned.

##### MaxLevel Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the maximum value of CurrentLevel that is capable of being assigned.

>
> The Options attribute is a bitmap that determines the default behavior of some cluster commands. Each command that is dependent on the Options attribute SHALL first construct a temporary Options bitmap that is in effect during the command processing. The temporary Options bitmap has the same format and meaning as the Options attribute, but includes any bits that may be overrid­ den by command fields.
>
> This attribute is meant to be changed only during commissioning.
>
> Command execution SHALL NOT continue beyond the Options processing if all of these criteria are true:

- The command is one of the ‘without On/Off’ commands: Move, Move to Level, Step, or Stop.

- The On/Off cluster exists on the same endpoint as this cluster.

- The OnOff attribute of the On/Off cluster, on this endpoint, is FALSE.

- The value of the ExecuteIfOff bit is 0.

1.  **ExecuteIfOff Bit**

> If this bit is set, commands in this cluster are executed and potentially change the CurrentLevel attribute when the OnOff attribute of the On/Off cluster is FALSE.

2.  **CoupleColorTempToLevel Bit**

> If this bit is set, changes to the CurrentLevel attribute SHALL be coupled with the color temperature set in the Color Control cluster.
>
> When not supporting the Lighting feature, this bit SHALL be zero and ignored.

##### OnOffTransitionTime Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the time taken to move to or from the target level when On or Off commands are received by an On/Off cluster on the same endpoint. It is specified in 1/10ths of a sec­ ond.
>
> The actual time taken SHOULD be as close to OnOffTransitionTime as the device is able. Please note that if the device is not able to move at a variable rate, the OnOffTransitionTime attribute SHOULD NOT be implemented.

##### OnLevel Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the value that the CurrentLevel attribute is set to when the OnOff attribute of an On/Off cluster on the same endpoint is set to TRUE, as a result of processing an On/Off cluster command. If the OnLevel attribute is not implemented, or is set to the null value, it has no effect. For more details see [Effect of On/Off Commands on the CurrentLevel attribute](#_bookmark115).
>
> OnLevel represents a mandatory field that was previously not present or optional. Implementers should be aware that older devices may not implement it.

##### OnTransitionTime Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the time taken to move the current level from the minimum level to the maximum level when an On command is received by an On/Off cluster on the same endpoint. It is specified in 1/10ths of a second. If this attribute is not implemented, or contains a null value, the OnOffTransitionTime SHALL be used instead.

##### OffTransitionTime Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the time taken to move the current level from the maximum level to the minimum level when an Off command is received by an On/Off cluster on the same endpoint. It is specified in 1/10ths of a second. If this attribute is not implemented, or contains a null value, the OnOffTransitionTime SHALL be used instead.

##### DefaultMoveRate Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the movement rate, in units per second, when a Move command is received with a null value Rate parameter.

##### StartUpCurrentLevel Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the desired startup level for a device when it is supplied with power and this level SHALL be reflected in the CurrentLevel attribute. The values of the StartUpCur­ rentLevel attribute are listed below:

| **Value** | **Action on power up** |
|----|----|
| 0 | Set the CurrentLevel attribute to the minimum value permitted on the device |

| **Value**    | **Action on power up**                               |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| null         | Set the CurrentLevel attribute to its previous value |
| other values | Set the CurrentLevel attribute to this value         |

> This behavior does not apply to reboots associated with OTA. After an OTA restart, the CurrentLevel attribute SHALL return to its value prior to the restart.

> **1.6.7.1.1. Effect on Receipt**
>
> The OptionsMask and OptionsOverride fields SHALL both be present. Default values are provided to interpret missing fields from legacy devices. A temporary Options bitmap SHALL be created from
>
> the Options attribute, using the OptionsMask and OptionsOverride fields. Each bit of the temporary Options bitmap SHALL be determined as follows:
>
> Each bit in the Options attribute SHALL determine the corresponding bit in the temporary Options bitmap, unless the OptionsMask field is present and has the corresponding bit set to 1, in which case the corresponding bit in the OptionsOverride field SHALL determine the corresponding bit in the temporary Options bitmap.
>
> The resulting temporary Options bitmap SHALL then be processed as defined in the [Options](#options-attribute) attribute.
>
> On receipt of this command, a device SHALL move from its current level to the value given in the Level field. The meaning of ‘level’ is device dependent – e.g., for a light it MAY mean brightness level.
>
> The movement SHALL be as continuous as technically practical, i.e., not a step function, and the time taken to move to the new level SHALL be equal to the value of the TransitionTime field, in tenths of a second, or as close to this as the device is able.
>
> If the TransitionTime field takes the value null then the time taken to move to the new level SHALL instead be determined by the OnOffTransitionTime attribute. If OnOffTransitionTime, which is an optional attribute, is not present, the device SHALL move to its new level as fast as it is able.
>
> If the device is not able to move at a variable rate, the TransitionTime field MAY be disregarded.

1.  **MoveMode Field**

> This field SHALL be one of the non-reserved values in [MoveModeEnum](#movemodeenum-type).

2.  **Rate Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the rate of movement in units per second. The actual rate of movement SHOULD be as close to this rate as the device is able. If the Rate field is null, then the value of the DefaultMoveRate attribute SHALL be used if that attribute is supported and its value is not null. If the Rate field is null and the DefaultMoveRate attribute is either not supported or set to null, then the device SHOULD move as fast as it is able. If the device is not able to move at a variable rate, this
>
> field MAY be disregarded.

3.  **Effect on Receipt**

> On receipt of this command, if the Rate field has a value of zero, the command has no effect and a response SHALL be returned with the status code set to INVALID_COMMAND.
>
> Otherwise, a device SHALL first create and process a temporary Options bitmap as described in the [MoveToLevel](#movetolevel-command) command.
>
> On receipt of this command, a device SHALL move from its current level in an up or down direction in a continuous fashion, as detailed below.

| **MoveMode** | **Action on Receipt** |
|----|----|
| Up | Increase the device’s level at the rate given in the Rate field. If the level reaches the maximum allowed for the device, stop. |
| Down | Decrease the device’s level at the rate given in the Rate field. If the level reaches the minimum allowed for the device, stop. |

##### Step Command

1.  **StepMode Field**

> This field SHALL be one of the non-reserved values in [StepModeEnum](#stepmodeenum-type).

2.  **StepSize Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the change to CurrentLevel.

3.  **TransitionTime Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the time that SHALL be taken to perform the step, in tenths of a second. A step is a change in the CurrentLevel of StepSize units. The actual time taken SHOULD be as close to
>
> this as the device is able. If the TransitionTime field is equal to null, the device SHOULD move as fast as it is able.
>
> If the device is not able to move at a variable rate, the TransitionTime field MAY be disregarded.

4.  **Effect on Receipt**

> On receipt of this command, if the StepSize field has a value of zero, the command has no effect and a response SHALL be returned with the status code set to INVALID_COMMAND.
>
> Otherwise, a device SHALL first create and process a temporary Options bitmap as described in the [MoveToLevel](#movetolevel-command) command.
>
> On receipt of this command, a device SHALL move from its current level in an up or down direction as detailed below.

| **StepMode** | **Action on Receipt** |
|----|----|
| Up | Increase CurrentLevel by StepSize units, or until it reaches the maximum level allowed for the device if this reached in the process. In the latter case, the transition time SHALL be proportion­ ally reduced. |
| Down | Decrease CurrentLevel by StepSize units, or until it reaches the minimum level allowed for the device if this reached in the process. In the latter case, the transition time SHALL be proportion­ ally reduced. |

##### Stop Command

| 1 | **OptionsOve rride** | [Options­](#optionsbitmap-type) [Bitmap](#optionsbitmap-type) | desc |  | 0 | M |

> **1.6.7.4.1. Effect of Receipt**
>
> On receipt of this command, a device SHALL first create and process a temporary Options bitmap as described in the [MoveToLevel](#movetolevel-command) command.
>
> Upon receipt of this command, any MoveToLevel, Move or Step command (and their 'with On/Off' variants) currently in process SHALL be terminated. The value of CurrentLevel SHALL be left at its value upon receipt of the Stop command, and RemainingTime SHALL be set to zero.
>
> This command has two entries in the [Commands](#commands-4) list, one for the MoveToLevel, Move and Step com­ mands, and one for their 'with On/Off' counterparts. This is solely for symmetry, to allow easy
>
> choice of one or other set of commands – the Stop commands are identical, because the dependency on On/Off is determined by the original command that is being stopped.

##### MoveToClosestFrequency Command

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **Frequency** | uint16 | all |  | 0 | M |

> **1.6.7.5.1. Effect of Receipt**
>
> Upon receipt of this command, the device SHALL change its current frequency to the requested fre­ quency, or to the closest frequency that it can generate. If the device cannot approximate the fre­ quency, then it SHALL return a default response with an error code of CONSTRAINT_ERROR. Deter­ mining if a requested frequency can be approximated by a supported frequency is a manufacturer- specific decision.

##### 'With On/Off' Commands

> The MoveToLevelWithOnOff, MoveWithOnOff and StepWithOnOff commands have identical data fields compared to the MoveToLevel, Move and Step commands respectively. They also have the same effects, except for the following additions.
>
> Before commencing any command that has the effect of setting the CurrentLevel attribute above the minimum level allowed by the device, the OnOff attribute of the On/Off cluster on the same end­ point, if implemented, SHALL be set to TRUE (‘On’).
>
> If any command that has the effect of setting the CurrentLevel attribute to the minimum level allowed by the device, the OnOff attribute of the On/Off cluster on the same endpoint, if imple­ mented, SHALL be set to FALSE (‘Off’).
>
> The StopWithOnOff command has identical data fields compared to the Stop command. Both Stop commands are identical, because the dependency on On/Off is determined by the original com­ mand that is being stopped.

### State Change Table for Lighting

> Below is a table of examples of state changes when Level Control and On/Off clusters are on the same endpoint and the Lighting feature is set.

### Features

> This cluster SHALL support the FeatureMap bitmap attribute as defined below.

| **Bit** | **Code** | **Feature** | **Conformance** | **Summary** |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **VIS** | Visual | O | Supports visual alarms |
| 1 | **AUD** | Audible | O | Supports audible alarms |
| 2 | **SPRS** | AlarmSuppress | \[VIS \| AUD\] | Supports ability to suppress or acknowledge alarms |
| 3 | **SENSLVL** | SensitivityLevel | O | Supports ability to set sensor sensitiv­ ity |

##### AlarmSuppress Feature

> This feature SHALL indicate that the device is able to suppress the supported alarm modes, when the user acknowledges the alarm. This is intended to stop visual and/or audible alarms, when the user has become aware that the sensor is triggered, but it is no longer desired to have the alarm modes active on the device, e.g.:

- The triggering cause have been resolved by the user, but the sensor has not yet stopped detect­ ing the triggering cause.

- The user is not able to address the triggering cause, but is aware of the alarm and sup­ press/acknowledge it be addressed at a later point.

> Acknowledge of alarms will for the remainder of this cluster be referred to as suppress.
>
> A suppressed alarm is still considered active and will remain so unless it is actively disabled or the triggering condition is not longer present. The action of suppressing an alarm mode is only applica­ ble to and is intended to stop the physical alarming, e.g. emitting a sound or blinking a light; it does not impact alarm reporting in AlarmsActive.

## Mode Select Cluster

> This cluster provides an interface for controlling a characteristic of a device that can be set to one of several predefined values. For example, the light pattern of a disco ball, the mode of a massage chair, or the wash cycle of a laundry machine.
>
> The server allows the client to set a mode on the server. A mode is one of a list of options that may be presented by a client for a user choice, or understood by the client, via the semantic tags on the
>
> mode.
>
> A semantic tag is either a standard tag within a standard category namespace, or a manufacturer specific tag, within the namespace of the vendor ID of the manufacturer. If there is no semantic tag, the mode is anonymous, and the selection is made by the user solely based on the Label string.
>
> Each cluster ID that indicates this specification SHALL define a distinct purpose for the cluster instance. For example: A LightBlinking cluster ID supports blinking modes for a light (and is described that way).
>
> An anonymous mode SHALL support the derived cluster purpose. A manufacturer specific seman­ tic tag SHALL support the derived cluster purpose. An anonymous mode SHALL NOT replace the meaning of a standard semantic tag, when one exists, for the cluster purpose.

### Data Types

##### SemanticTagStruct Type

> A Semantic Tag is meant to be interpreted by the client for the purpose the cluster serves.

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Access** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **MfgCode** | vendor-id | desc | F |  |  | M |
| 1 | **Value** | enum16 | all | F |  |  | M |

1.  **Value Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the semantic tag within a semantic tag namespace which is either manu­ facturer specific or standard. For semantic tags in a standard namespace, see [Standard Namespace](#standardnamespace-attribute).

2.  **MfgCode Field**

> This field SHALL indicate a manufacturer code (Vendor ID), and the Value field SHALL indicate a semantic tag defined by the manufacturer. Each manufacturer code supports a single namespace of values. The same manufacturer code and semantic tag value in separate cluster instances are part of the same namespace and have the same meaning. For example: a manufacturer tag meaning "pinch", has the same meaning in a cluster whose purpose is to choose the amount of sugar, or amount of salt.

##### ModeOptionStruct Type

> This is a struct representing a possible mode of the server.

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Access** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **Label** | string | max 64 | F | MS |  | M |

| 2 | **Semantic­ Tags** | list\[[Seman­](#semantictagstruct-type) [tic­](#semantictagstruct-type) [TagStruct](#semantictagstruct-type)\] | max 64 | F | MS |  | M |

1.  **Label Field**

> This field is readable text that describes the mode option that can be used by a client to indicate to the user what this option means. This field is meant to be readable and understandable by the user.

2.  **Mode Field**

> The Mode field is used to identify the mode option. The value SHALL be unique for every item in the SupportedModes attribute.

3.  **SemanticTags Field**

> This field is a list of semantic tags that map to the mode option. This MAY be used by clients to determine the meaning of the mode option as defined in a standard or manufacturer specific name­ space. Semantic tags can help clients look for options that meet certain criteria. A semantic tag SHALL be either a standard tag or manufacturer specific tag as defined in each [SemanticTagStruct](#semantictagstruct-type) list entry.
>
> A mode option MAY have more than one semantic tag. A mode option MAY be mapped to a mixture of standard and manufacturer specific semantic tags.
>
> All standard semantic tags are from a single namespace indicated by the StandardNamespace attribute.
>
> For example: A mode labeled "100%" can have both the HIGH (MS) and MAX (standard) semantic tag. Clients seeking the option for either HIGH or MAX will find the same option in this case.

##### Description Attribute

> This attribute describes the purpose of the server, in readable text.
>
> For example, a coffee machine may have a Mode Select cluster for the amount of milk to add, and another Mode Select cluster for the amount of sugar to add. In this case, the first instance can have the description Milk and the second instance can have the description Sugar. This allows the user to tell the purpose of each of the instances.

##### StandardNamespace Attribute

> This attribute, when not null, SHALL indicate a single standard namespace for any standard seman­
>
> tic tag value supported in this or any other cluster instance with the same value of this attribute. A null value indicates no standard namespace, and therefore, no standard semantic tags are provided in this cluster instance. Each standard namespace and corresponding values and value meanings SHALL be defined in another document.

##### SupportedModes Attribute

> This attribute is the list of supported modes that may be selected for the CurrentMode attribute. Each item in this list represents a unique mode as indicated by the Mode field of the ModeOption­ Struct. Each entry in this list SHALL have a unique value for the Mode field.

##### CurrentMode Attribute

> This attribute represents the current mode of the server.
>
> The value of this field must match the Mode field of one of the entries in the SupportedModes
>
> attribute.

##### StartUpMode Attribute

> The StartUpMode attribute value indicates the desired startup mode for the server when it is sup­ plied with power.
>
> If this attribute is not null, the CurrentMode attribute SHALL be set to the StartUpMode value, when the server is powered up, except in the case when the OnMode attribute overrides the StartUpMode attribute (see [OnModeWithPowerUp](#_bookmark162)).
>
> This behavior does not apply to reboots associated with OTA. After an OTA restart, the CurrentMode attribute SHALL return to its value prior to the restart.
>
> The value of this field SHALL match the Mode field of one of the entries in the SupportedModes
>
> attribute.
>
> If this attribute is not implemented, or is set to the null value, it SHALL have no effect.

##### OnMode Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the value of CurrentMode that depends on the state of the On/Off cluster on the same endpoint. If this attribute is not present or is set to null, it SHALL NOT have an effect, otherwise the CurrentMode attribute SHALL depend on the OnOff attribute of the On/Off cluster as described in the table below:

| **OnOff Change** | **CurrentMode Change**       |
|------------------|------------------------------|
| ON → OFF         | No change                    |

> The value of this field SHALL match the Mode field of one of the entries in the SupportedModes
>
> attribute.
>
> **1.9.6.6.1. OnMode with Power Up**
>
> If the On/Off feature is supported and the On/Off cluster attribute [StartUpOnOff](#startuponoff-attribute) is present, with a value of On (turn on at power up), then the CurrentMode attribute SHALL be set to the OnMode attribute value when the server is supplied with power, except if the OnMode attribute is null.

- A mode named "100%" can have both the High (manufacturer specific) and Max (standard) mode tag. Clients seeking the mode for either High or Max will find the same mode in this case.

- A mode that includes a LowEnergy tag can be displayed by the client using a widget icon that shows a green leaf.

- A mode that includes a LowNoise tag may be used by the client when the user wishes for a lower level of audible sound, less likely to disturb the household’s activities.

- A mode that includes a LowEnergy tag (standard, defined in this cluster specification) and also a Delicate tag (standard, defined in the namespace of a Laundry Mode derived cluster).

- A mode that includes both a generic Quick tag (defined here), and Vacuum and Mop tags, (defined in the RVC Clean cluster that is a derivation of this cluster).

| 0x40 to 0x7F | **DerivedClusterCodes** | Derived cluster specific stan­ dard values defined in the derived Mode Base cluster spec­ ification. |
| 0x80 to 0xBF | **MfgCodes** | Manufacturer specific values. For the derived Mode Base clus­ ter instances, these are manu­ facturer specific under the derived cluster. |

> The set of Status field values defined in each of the generic or derived Mode Base cluster specifica­ tions is called StatusCode.

##### Mode Base Status CommonCodes Range

> The following table defines the common StatusCode values.

| **Status Code** | **Name** | **Summary** |
|----|----|----|

| 0x01 | **UnsupportedMode** | The value of the NewMode field doesn’t match any entries in the SupportedModes attribute. |

| **Status Code** | **Name** | **Summary** |
|----|----|----|
| 0x02 | **GenericFailure** | Generic failure code, indicating that switching to the mode indi­ cated by the NewMode field is not allowed or not possible. |
| 0x03 | **InvalidInMode** | The received request cannot be handled due to the current mode of the device |

> The derived cluster code definitions SHALL NOT duplicate the common code definitions. For exam­ ple, a derived cluster specification SHALL NOT define a status code with the same semantic as the common code of 0x01 (UnsupportedMode).
>
> If the Status field is set to Success, the StatusText field is optional.
>
> If the Status field is set to UnsupportedMode, the StatusText field SHALL be an empty string.
>
> If the Status field is not set to Success or UnsupportedMode, the StatusText field SHALL include a vendor-defined error description which can be used to explain the error to the user. For example, if the Status field is set to InvalidInMode, the StatusText field SHOULD indicate why the transition to the requested mode is not allowed, given the current mode of the device, which may involve other clusters.

### Mode Namespace

> This section provides the definitions of the mode tag ranges and of the common standard mode tag values available in the instances of this cluster.

> This cluster would be supported on an endpoint that represents a physical device with a low power mode. This cluster provides a sleep() command to allow clients to manually put the device into low power mode. There is no command here to wake up a sleeping device because that operation often involves other protocols such as [Wake On LAN](#_bookmark28). Most devices automatically enter low power mode based upon inactivity.
>
> The cluster server for Low Power is implemented by a device that supports a low power mode, such as a TV, Set-top box, or Smart Speaker.

##### NOTE

> We have considered a “DisableLowPowerMode” command but have not added it due to suspected issues with energy consumption regulations. This can be added in the future.

## Wake On LAN Cluster

> This cluster provides an interface for managing low power mode on a device that supports the Wake On LAN or Wake On Wireless LAN (WLAN) protocol (see \[[Wake On LAN](#_bookmark28)\]).
>
> This cluster would be supported on IP devices that have a low power mode AND support the ability to be woken up using the Wake on LAN or Wake on WLAN protocol. This cluster provides the device MAC address which is a required input to the Wake on LAN protocol. Besides the MAC address, this cluster provides an optional link-local IPv6 address which is useful to support "Wake on Direct Packet" used by some Ethernet and Wi-Fi devices.
>
> Acting on the MAC address or link-local IPv6 address information does require the caller to be in the same broadcast domain as the destination. To wake the destination up, the caller sends a multi­ cast-based magic UDP packet that contains destination’s MAC address in the UDP payload to FF02::1, the IPv6 all-nodes link-local multicast group address. If the optional link-local address is provided by the destination through this cluster, the caller also sends the magic UDP packet in unicast to that link-local address. This unicast-based method is particularly useful for Wi-Fi devices, since due to lack of MAC layer retransmission mechanism, multicast over Wi-Fi is not as reliable as unicast. If a device provides the link-local address in this cluster, its Ethernet controller or Wi-Fi radio SHALL respond to the IPv6 neighbor solicitation message for the link-local address without the need to wake host CPU up. In order to receive the magic or neighbor solicitation packets in multicast, the Wi-Fi devices must support Group Temporal Key (GTK) rekey operation in low power mode.

> The cluster server for Wake on LAN or Wake on WLAN is implemented by a device that supports the Wake on LAN/WLAN protocol, such as a TV, Set-top Box, or Smart Speaker.

[TABLE]

##### MACAddress Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the current MAC address of the device. Only 48-bit MAC Addresses SHALL be used for this attribute as required by the Wake on LAN protocol.
>
> Format of this attribute SHALL be an upper-case hex-encoded string representing the hex address, like 12345678ABCD.

##### LinkLocalAddress Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the current link-local address of the device. Only 128-bit IPv6 link- local addresses SHALL be used for this attribute.

##### NOTE

> Some companies may consider MAC Address to be protected data subject to PII han­ dling considerations and will therefore choose not to include it or read it. The MAC Address can often be determined using ARP in IPv4 or NDP in IPv6.

## Switch Cluster

> This cluster exposes interactions with a switch device, for the purpose of using those interactions by other devices.
>
> Two types of switch devices are supported: latching switch (e.g. rocker switch) and momentary switch (e.g. push button), distinguished with their feature flags.
>
> Interactions with the switch device are exposed as attributes (for the latching switch) and as events (for both types of switches).
>
> An interested client MAY subscribe to these attributes/events and thus be informed of the interac­ tions, and can perform actions based on this, for example by sending commands to perform an action such as controlling a light or a window shade.

##### LatchingSwitch Feature

> This feature flag is for a switch that maintains its position after being pressed (or turned).

##### MomentarySwitch Feature

> This feature flag is for a switch that does not maintain its position after being pressed (or turned). After releasing, it goes back to its idle position.

##### MomentarySwitchRelease Feature

> This feature flag is for a momentary switch that can distinguish and report release events.

##### MomentarySwitchLongPress Feature

> This feature flag is for a momentary switch that can distinguish and report long presses from short presses.

##### MomentarySwitchMultiPress Feature

> This feature flag is for a momentary switch that can distinguish and report double press and poten­ tially multiple presses with more events, such as triple press, etc.

##### ActionSwitch Feature

> This feature flag indicates simplified handling of events for multi-press-capable switches. See [Multi](#sequence-of-events-for-multipress) [Press Details](#sequence-of-events-for-multipress).

##### NumberOfPositions Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the maximum number of positions the switch has. Any kind of switch has a minimum of 2 positions. Also see [Multi Position Details](#multi-position-details) for the case NumberOfPositions\>2.

##### CurrentPosition Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the position of the switch. The valid range is zero to NumberOfPositions - 1.
>
> CurrentPosition value 0 SHALL be assigned to the default position of the switch: for example the "open" state of a rocker switch, or the "idle" state of a push button switch.

##### MultiPressMax Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate how many consecutive presses can be detected and reported by a momentary switch which supports multi-press (MSM feature flag set).
>
> For example, a momentary switch supporting single press, double press and triple press, but not quad press and beyond, would return the value 3.
>
> When more than MultiPressMax presses are detected within a multi-press sequence:

- The server for cluster revision \< 2 SHOULD generate a MultiPressComplete event with the Total­ NumberOfPressesCounted field set to the value of the MultiPressMax attribute, and avoid gener­ ating any further InitialPress and MultiPressOngoing events until the switch has become fully idle (i.e. no longer in the process of counting presses within the multipress).

- The server for cluster revision \>= 2 SHALL generate a MultiPressComplete event with the Total­ NumberOfPressesCounted field set to zero (indicating an aborted sequence), and SHALL NOT generate any further InitialPress and MultiPressOngoing events until the switch has become fully idle (i.e. no longer in the process of counting presses within the multipress).

> This approach avoids unintentionally causing intermediate actions where there is a very long sequence of presses beyond MultiPressMax that MAY be taken in account specially by switches (e.g. to trigger special behavior such as factory reset for which generating events towards the client is not appropriate).

##### SwitchLatched Event

> This event SHALL be generated, when the latching switch is moved to a new position. It MAY have been delayed by debouncing within the switch.
>
> The data of this event SHALL contain the following information:

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **NewPosi­ tion** | uint8 | 0 to Num­ berOfPosi­ tions-1 |  |  | M |

> **1.13.6.1.1. NewPosition Field**
>
> This field SHALL indicate the new value of the CurrentPosition attribute, i.e. after the move.

##### InitialPress Event

> This event SHALL be generated, when the momentary switch starts to be pressed (after debounc­ ing).
>
> The data of this event SHALL contain the following information:

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **NewPosi­ tion** | uint8 | 0 to Num­ berOfPosi­ tions-1 |  |  | M |

> **1.13.6.2.1. NewPosition Field**
>
> This field SHALL indicate the new value of the CurrentPosition attribute, i.e. while pressed.

##### LongPress Event

> This event SHALL be generated when the momentary switch has been pressed for a "long" time. The time interval constituting a "long" time is manufacturer-determined, since it depends on the switch physics.

- When the AS feature flag is set, this event:

  - SHALL NOT be generated during a multi-press sequence (since a long press is a separate cycle from any multi-press cycles);

  - SHALL only be generated after the first InitialPress following a MultiPressComplete when a long press is detected after the idle time.

- Else, when the MSM feature flag is set, this event:

  - SHALL NOT be generated during a multi-press sequence (since a long press is a separate cycle from any multi-press cycles);

  - SHALL only be generated after the first InitialPress following a MultiPressComplete when a long press is detected after the idle time;

  - SHALL NOT be generated after a MultiPressOngoing event without an intervening Multi­ PressComplete event.

> The above constraints imply that for a given activity detection cycle of a switch having MSM and/or MSL feature flags set, the entire activity is either a single long press detection cycle of (InitialPress, LongPress, LongRelease), or a single multi-press detection cycle (ending in MultiPressComplete), where presses that would otherwise be reported as long presses are instead reported as a counted press in the MultiPressComplete event, and as InitialPress/ShortRelease pairs otherwise (where applicable).
>
> The rationale for this constraint is the ambiguity of interpretation of events when mixing long presses and multi-press events.
>
> The data of this event SHALL contain the following information:

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |

> **1.13.6.3.1. NewPosition Field**
>
> This field SHALL indicate the new value of the CurrentPosition attribute, i.e. while pressed.

##### ShortRelease Event

> If the server has the Action Switch (AS) feature flag set, this event SHALL NOT be generated at all, since setting the Action Switch feature flag forbids the Momentary Switch ShortRelease (MSR) fea­ ture flag from being set. Otherwise, the following paragraphs describe the situations where this event is generated.
>
> This event SHALL be generated, when the momentary switch has been released (after debouncing).

- If the server has the Momentary Switch LongPress (MSL) feature flag set, then this event SHALL be generated when the switch is released if ***no*** LongPress event had been generated since the previous InitialPress event.

- If the server does not have the Momentary Switch LongPress (MSL) feature flag set, this event SHALL be generated when the switch is released - even when the switch was pressed for a long time.

- Also see [Section 1.13.7, “Sequence of generated events”](#sequence-of-generated-events).

> **1.13.6.4.1. PreviousPosition Field**

##### LongRelease Event

> This event SHALL be generated, when the momentary switch has been released (after debouncing) and after having been pressed for a long time, i.e. this event SHALL be generated when the switch is released if a LongPress event has been generated since the previous InitialPress event. Also see [Section 1.13.7, “Sequence of generated events”](#sequence-of-generated-events).

>
> This event SHALL be generated to indicate how many times the momentary switch has been pressed in a multi-press sequence, *during* that sequence. See [Multi Press Details](#sequence-of-events-for-multipress) below.

1.  **NewPosition Field**

- a value of 2 when the second press of a multi-press sequence has been detected,

- a value of 3 when the third press of a multi-press sequence has been detected,

- a value of N when the N^(th) press of a multi-press sequence has been detected.

##### MultiPressComplete Event

> This event SHALL be generated to indicate how many times the momentary switch has been pressed in a multi-press sequence, after it has been detected that the sequence has *ended*. See [Multi](#sequence-of-events-for-multipress) [Press Details](#sequence-of-events-for-multipress).

> The PreviousPosition field SHALL indicate the previous value of the CurrentPosition attribute, i.e. just prior to release.
>
> The TotalNumberOfPressesCounted field SHALL contain:

- a value of 0 when there was an aborted multi-press sequence, where the number of presses goes beyond MultiPressMax presses,

- a value of 1 when there was exactly one press in a multi-press sequence (and the sequence has ended), i.e. there was no double press (or more),

- a value of 2 when there were exactly two presses in a multi-press sequence (and the sequence has ended),

- a value of 3 when there were exactly three presses in a multi-press sequence (and the sequence has ended),

- a value of N when there were exactly N presses in a multi-press sequence (and the sequence has ended).

##### NOTE

> The introduction of TotalNumberOfPressesCounted supporting the value 0 MAY impact clients of switches using cluster revision 1 since such servers would not use this value of TotalNumberOfPressesCounted to indicate an aborted sequence. Clients SHOULD always act using the TotalNumberOfPressesCounted field taken into account since for values from 1 to MultiPressMax, the user action that led to the event was different depending on the count.

### Sequence of generated events

> This section describes the sequence of events that will be generated by three types of momentary switches (distinguished by their feature flags). For each switch type, we will define the sequence of generated events for these three interactions:

1.  Sequence for a switch which is pressed briefly.

2.  Sequence for a switch pressed for a long time.

3.  Sequence for a switch pressed for a very long time.

> In the three interactions described in the subsections below, if the NumberOfPositions attribute is equal to 2, the InitialPress and LongPress events have the NewPosition field set to 1 and the Short­ Release and LongRelease events have the PreviousPosition field set to 1. For larger values of the NumberOfPositions attribute, see [Multi Position Details](#multi-position-details).

##### Switches with long-press detection support (MSL feature flag set)

> This switch (with feature flags MS & MSL both set) SHALL generate either a sequence of two or three (depending on how long the switch is pressed) events for one interaction cycle, in the order given below and illustrated in the figure below.

- Upon a short press:

  - Generate InitialPress

  - If the MSR feature flag is set and the AS feature flag is NOT set, generate ShortRelease after the previous event, when release is detected.

    - ![](media/image4.png)![](media/image5.png)If the MSM feature flag is set, generate MultiPressComplete(1) after the previous event(s).

&nbsp;

- Upon a long press (or very long press):

  - Generate InitialPress

  - Generate LongPress after the previous event, when long press is detected

  - Generate LongRelease (and NOT MultiPressComplete(1)) after the previous event, when switch release is detected.

> A LongPress event SHALL be generated exactly once for this case and SHALL NOT be repeated, irre­ spective how long the switch is pressed.
>
> The image shows a time representation of the state of the switch (low=not pressed, high=pressed) with the colored dots indicating the various events generated at that moment in time.

![](media/image6.png)

> ![](media/image7.png)![](media/image9.png)*Figure 3. Switch device with MSL feature flag set (single press case)*

##### Switches without long-press detection support (MSL feature flag not set)

> This switch (with feature flags states MS & !MSL) SHALL NOT generate LongPress and LongRelease events and therefore it SHALL generate a sequence of two events for one interaction cycle, irre­ spective of how long the switch is pressed, in the order given and illustrated below, based on whether the MSM, AS and MSR flags are set.

- Any press length:

1.  Generate InitialPress

2.  If the MSR feature flag is set and the AS feature flag is NOT set, generate ShortRelease after the previous event, when the release is detected.

3.  If the MSM feature flag is set, generate MultiPressComplete(1) after the previous event(s).

##### NOTE

> Even after a "long" period being pressed, the release event is never LongRelease. A device without the MSL feature flag SHALL NOT generate the LongPress and Lon­ gRelease events.

##### Switches with most basic MS-only feature flag set, not (MSR \| MSL \| MSM \| AS)

> This switch (with feature flags states MS & !MSR & !MSL & !MSM & !AS) SHALL generate a single Ini­ tialPress event for one interaction cycle, irrespective of how long the switch is pressed, as illus­ trated in the figure below.
>
> A device with this set of feature flags SHALL NOT generate any of the ShortRelease, LongPress and LongRelease events.

### Sequence of events for MultiPress

> Multi-press detection is a feature of momentary switches (indicated with feature flag MSM being set, with optional AS feature flag set) that they can count and report sequences of press-release cycles within a certain time frame, for example to indicate that the user has pressed the switch once, twice or three (or even more) times in succession. The definition of the time window for this detection is manufacturer-specific since it depends on the switch physics. The maximum number of presses which can be detected and reported SHALL be indicated in attribute MultiPressMax. The minimum value and default value for MultiPressMax are both 2.
>
> A switch supporting MultiPress SHALL set feature flags MS & MSM, and MAY optionally, according to conformance rules of each flag, set flags MSL, MSR, and AS.
>
> The ActionSwitch (AS) feature flag is a behavior selector which, when set, reduces the number of events generated by the switch.
>
> A press cycle when MSM is set is **either** a long-press cycle (if MSL set), **or** a multi-press cycle.

- If the MSL feature flag is set and the cycle is deemed "long" during the first press cycle after Ini­ tialPress, then the switch SHALL react as described in [Section 1.13.7.1, “Switches with long-press](#switches-with-long-press-detection-support-msl-feature-flag-set) [detection support (MSL feature flag set)”](#switches-with-long-press-detection-support-msl-feature-flag-set), and SHALL NOT consider this to be the start of a multi-press sequence (see penultimate case illustrated in [Figure 7, “Switch device with MSM and](#_bookmark199)

> [!AS feature flags (multi-press case)”](#_bookmark199)).

- If the MSL feature flag is not set or if the first button press cycle is short, then the switch SHALL count presses until the switch becomes sufficiently idle, and SHALL NOT generate LongPress and LongRelease events for intermediate presses within the multi-press cycle that are "long".

##### Multi-press behavior when ActionsSwitch (AS) feature flag is not set

> A switch with the MSM feature flag set but the AS flag unset:

- SHALL generate an InitialPress event at the start of every button press within a button multi- press cycle;

- SHALL generate a ShortRelease event at the end of every button press within a button multi- press cycle if MSR is set;

- SHALL generate a MultiPressOngoing event after the InitialPress event of the second and subse­ quent presses of a button multi-press cycle;

- SHALL generate a MultiPressComplete at the end of a multi-press cycle, including single presses;

- SHALL NOT (for cluster revision \>=2) or SHOULD NOT (for cluster revision \<2) generate any LongPress and LongRelease events within the multi-press cycle.

> The MultiPressOngoing event is provided for parties interested in keeping track of the actual presses during the multi-press sequence. The MultiPressComplete event is provided for parties interested in the outcome of the whole sequence: after the multi-press sequence has ended, they will receive the MultiPressComplete event indicating how many times the switch was pressed.
>
> In the figure below, several sequences of user interaction are indicated:

- Single press sequence: after the press and release moments, the InitialPress SHALL be gener­ ated, and ShortRelease events SHALL be generated if the MSR feature flag is set. After some fur­ ther time, when the switch has detected that there is no second press, it SHALL generate Multi­ PressComplete(1) since it has detected that the sequence consisted of one press. No MultiPres­ sOngoing event SHALL be generated for this case.

- Double press sequence: after each of the press and release moments, the InitialPress SHALL be generated, and ShortRelease events SHALL be generated if the MSR feature flag is set. Addition­ ally, when the switch is pressed for the second time, the MultiPressOngoing(2) event SHALL be generated, as the switch has detected the second press. Note that this event coincides with the second InitialPress event; both SHALL be generated. After some further time, when the switch has detected that there is no third press, it SHALL generate MultiPressComplete(2) since it has detected that the sequence consisted of two presses.

- Triple press sequence: after each press and release moments, the InitialPress SHALL be gener­ ated, and ShortRelease events SHALL be generated if the MSR feature flag is set. Additionally, when the switch is pressed for the second time, the MultiPressOngoing(2) event SHALL be gen­ erated, as the switch has detected the second press. Note that this event coincides with the sec­ ond InitialPress event; both SHALL be generated. Additionally, when the switch is pressed for the third time, the MultiPressOngoing(3) event SHALL be generated, as the switch has detected the third press. Note that this event coincides with the third InitialPress event; both SHALL be generated. After some further time, when the switch has detected that there is no fourth press, it SHALL generate MultiPressComplete(3) since it has detected that the sequence consisted of three presses.

  - This case specifically does NOT generate LongPress and LongRelease events within the sequence (even though the figure below illustrates a longer press duration for the second

> press in one of the cases), since multi-press sequences SHOULD/SHALL NOT generate Long­ Press and LongRelease events within the sequence (see [Section 1.13.6.3, “LongPress Event”](#longpress-event) for more details).

- N presses starting with a long press (if MSL feature flag is set): this starts with a long press sequence wish SHALL be considered according to [Section 1.13.7.1, “Switches with long-press](#switches-with-long-press-detection-support-msl-feature-flag-set) [detection support (MSL feature flag set)”](#switches-with-long-press-detection-support-msl-feature-flag-set). Then it is a sequence similar to triple press, with N presses instead of 3.

> For the above cases where multiple events need to be generated at the same time, the MultiPres­ sOngoing event SHALL be generated directly after the InitialPress event.

##### NOTE

> The numbers in parentheses in the bulleted text above and in the figure below indi­ cate the value of the CurrentNumberOfPressesCounted resp. TotalNumberOfPress­ esCounted field in the event data.

##### NOTE

> As with the other figures, sufficient debounce time needs to be take into account for the detection of press and release events. This is included in the figure, and has been left out of the description above for readability, but SHALL be applied.

##### NOTE

> Several of the events require very low congestion and latency in the final system to be usable for real-time control and use cases. Care must be taken during design not to rely on very low latency and real-time event timestamps if the low-latency assumptions do not hold.

##### Multi-press behavior when ActionsSwitch (AS) feature flag is set

> When the ActionSwitch feature flag is set, the behavior for all presses:

- The switch SHALL only generate an InitialPress event at the start of every button press cycle (whether long or not);

- The switch SHALL NOT generate ShortRelease events;

- The switch SHALL NOT generate MultiPressOngoing events.

> Because of these simplifications, clients can decide to act purely on the following to determine user action:

- LongRelease (if MSL feature flag is set) to determine the end of a long press.

  - InitialPress and LongPress (if MSL feature flag is set), if needed, to detect the start of the press and long-press periods so that actions such as "do action X while long pressed and stop on release" can be supported.

- MultiPressComplete to determine the end of a series of presses (0 .. MultiPressMax)

  - Only the final count of presses detected by the switch is provided.

  - The value of 0 indicates an aborted press (e.g. maybe too many presses in a row, button held down for too long, etc).

  - The value of 1 indicates a single press, 2 a double-press, etc.

> Because of the omission of ShortRelease, MultiPressOngoing and the "inner" InitialPress events, less network traffic is generated, while not missing the overall "action" intent from the end-user.
>
> In the figure below, several sequences of user interaction are indicated:

- Single press sequence: after the initial press detection, the InitialPress event is generated. After some further time, when the switch has detected that there is no second press, and the press is not a long press (if MSL feature flag is set), it generates the MultiPressComplete(1) event since it has detected that the sequence consisted of one press.

- Double press sequence: after the initial press detection, the InitialPress event is generated. After some further time, when the switch has detected that there is no third press, it generates the MultiPressComplete(2) event since it has detected that the sequence consisted of two presses.

- N-press sequence: after the initial press detection, the InitialPress event is generated. Addition­ ally, when the switch is pressed for the second time, we note that the press is long, but there is not a LongPress or LongRelease event, since long presses inside (not at the start) of a multi-press sequence are treated as short presses. After some further time, when the switch has detected that there are no further presses beyond N presses, it generates a MultiPressComplete(N) event since it has detected that the sequence consisted of N presses.

- Long press sequence followed by N-press sequence:

  - This case contains to two separate sequences, since a long press sequence is always an inde­ pendent sequence, and does not get reported as "long" within multi-presses (see previous example case).

  - The first sequence is a Long Press sequence of: InitialPress, LongPress, and finally, LongRe­ lease.

  - The second sequence, whether immediate or not, is a N-press sequence of: InitialPress, and finally, MultiPressComplete(N).

&nbsp;

- ![](media/image25.png)![](media/image33.png)![](media/image34.png)![](media/image35.png)![](media/image36.png)N-press sequence with N \> MultiPressMax: after the initial press detection, the InitialPress event is generated. After some further time, when the switch has detected that there are no further presses beyond N presses, it generates a MultiPressComplete(0) event since it has detected that the multi-press sequence is done, but since there were more presses than MultiPressMax, the sequence uses 0 for TotalNumberOfPressesCounted to indicate invalid complete sequence.

### Summary of cases for MS feature flag

> Given the variety of situations that may arise due to the different switch capabilities, the following describes the edges that would unambiguously convey user action intents:

- MS & !MSR & !MSM: Every action cycle is only a single InitialPress event.

- MS & !MSM: Every action cycle ends on ShortRelease or LongRelease (if MSL feature flag is set), depending on long or short press and whether MSR/MSL feature flags are set.

- MS & MSM: Every action cycle ends on either LongRelease (if MSL feature flag is set and first press was long) or MultiPressComplete.

  - The AS feature flag does not change the outcome of which events can be used for action detection.

  - The AS feature flag is backwards-compatible with previous revisions of this cluster.

  - The AS feature flag primarily offers a reduction of events generated.

> The above list is relevant for the case of a client which does not use the events indicating progress during the action cycle (i.e. ShortRelease, MultiPressOngoing, repeated InitialPress) for its opera­ tion.

### Multi Position Details

> This section will discuss some archetypes of switch devices with more than 2 positions and how they SHALL set attribute values and generate events matching their characteristics.
>
> For the SwitchLatched, InitialPress, LongPress and MultiPressOngoing events, the field NewPosition SHALL be set to the value corresponding to the new position to which the switch was moved. For the ShortRelease, LongRelease and MultiPressComplete events, the field PreviousPosition SHALL be set to the value corresponding to the position of the switch just preceding the (latest) release.

##### Latching Switch with N stable positions (N\>2) with fixed sequence

> With such a device, the user can move the switch from a position M to positions M-1 and M+1 (either with a wraparound between the end positions, or fixed stop at the end positions).
>
> On each interaction with the switch device, it SHALL generate a SwitchLatched event with the New­ Position field set to the value associated with the new position.
>
> Due to the physical constraints, such an event will have a NewPosition field which is equal to the previous NewPosition field plus or minus 1 (modulo NumPositions if the switch does not have end stops).
>
> In a first example, a switch has 3 positions, associated with values 0, 1 and 2. In this case, wrap­ around is not possible: from position 0 it can only be moved to position 1.

> pos C =\> report 2
>
> *Figure 8. Rotary switch device with 3 positions*
>
> In another example, a switch has 8 positions, associated with values 0 through 7. In this case, the physics of the switch allow wraparound: from position 0 it can be moved to position 1 or to position 7.

> *Figure 9. Rotary switch device with 8 positions and wraparound*

##### Latching Switch with N stable positions (N\>2) with random sequence (example: radio buttons)

> With such a device, the user can press any of the available buttons, so this switch does not show the incrementing or decrementing behavior of NewPosition which we discussed for the latching switch with fixed sequence. In the example in the figure below, the 5 buttons are labeled "A" through "E" for the user and are associated with values 0 through 4. The user first presses the "A" button, and the switch device generates a SwitchLatched event with NewPosition set to 0. Then the user first presses the "D" button, and the switch device generates a SwitchLatched event with NewPosition set to 4.
>
> button A pressed =\> report 0 button D pressed =\> report 4
>
> *Figure 10. Switch device with radio buttons*

##### Momentary Switch with 2 or more non-stable positions

> For a Momentary Switch with more than 1 stable position, it depends on the physics of the switch device which sequence of events will be generated.

##### NOTE

> In this section we will mention only the InitialPress and ShortRelease events. The switch device could also generate the other events defined above for a momentary switch, depending on the capabilities of the switch device and the interaction with the switch device.
>
> The first variant (figure below, example: up/down control for window blinds) shows a switch in neutral position (left figure) which corresponds to CurrentPosition=0. The user can press the top
>
> side (position value 1) or the bottom side (position value 2). It is not possible to go directly from position 1 to position 2 or vice versa - the switch will always need to go through the neutral position 0.
>
> So when the user presses the top side of the switch, the InitialPress (NewPosition=1) event will be generated. When they release the top side, the ShortRelease (PreviousPosition=1) event will be gen­ erated. The user continues to press the bottom side, and the event InitialPress (NewPosition=2) is generated. Upon release of the bottom side, the event ShortRelease (PreviousPosition=2) is gener­ ated.
>
> neutral position (0) top side pressed (1) bottom side pressed (2)
>
> *Figure 11. Up/down control switch device*
>
> Another variant (figure below, example: joystick) has a control handle with a neutral position in the middle (left figure) which corresponds to CurrentPosition=0. The handle can be moved along the dotted lines.
>
> In the middle figure, the user moves the handle to the East position and then releases it (which makes it return to the neutral middle position). This generates this sequence of events:
>
> In the righthand figure, the user moves the handle to the SouthWest position, then to the South position and then releases it (which makes it return to the neutral middle position). This generates this sequence of events:

>
> then release (to middle position)
>
> *Figure 12. Switch device with joystick*
>
> Therefore, in the "joystick" variation, there could be a succession of InitialPress events without an intermediate ShortRelease events - unlike the "window blinds control" variation which will always have such an intermediate ShortRelease event.

## Operational State Cluster

> This cluster supports remotely monitoring and, where supported, changing the operational state of any device where a state machine is a part of the operation.
>
> This cluster defines common states, scoped to this cluster (e.g. Stopped, Running, Paused, Error). A derived cluster specification may define more states scoped to the derivation. Manufacturer spe­ cific states are supported in this cluster and any derived clusters thereof. When defined in a derived instance, such states are scoped to the derivation.
>
> Actual state transitions are dependent on both the implementation, and the requirements that may additionally be imposed by a derived cluster.
>
> An implementation that supports remotely starting its operation can make use of this cluster’s Start command to do so. A device that supports remote pause or stop of its currently selected operation can similarly make use of this cluster’s Pause and Stop commands to do so. The ability to remotely pause or stop is independent of how the operation was started (for example, an operation started by using a manual button press can be stopped by using a Stop command if the device supports remotely stopping the operation).
>
> Additionally, this cluster provides events for monitoring the operational state of the device.

##### PhaseList Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate a list of names of different phases that the device can go through for the selected function or mode. The list may not be in sequence order. For example in a washing machine this could include items such as "pre-soak", "rinse", and "spin". These phases are manufac­ turer specific and may change when a different function or mode is selected.
>
> A null value indicates that the device does not present phases during its operation. When this attribute’s value is null, the CurrentPhase attribute SHALL also be set to null.

##### CurrentPhase Attribute

> This attribute represents the current phase of operation being performed by the server. This SHALL be the positional index representing the value from the set provided in the PhaseList Attribute,
>
> where the first item in that list is an index of 0. Thus, this attribute SHALL have a maximum value that is "length(PhaseList) - 1".
>
> This attribute SHALL be null if the PhaseList attribute is null or if the PhaseList attribute is an empty list.

##### CountdownTime Attribute

> This attribute SHALL represent the estimated time left before the operation is completed, in sec­ onds.
>
> A value of 0 (zero) means that the operation has completed.
>
> A value of null represents that there is no time currently defined until operation completion. This MAY happen, for example, because no operation is in progress or because the completion time is unknown.
>
> Changes to this attribute SHALL only be marked as reportable in the following cases:

- If it has changed due to a change in the CurrentPhase or OperationalState attributes, or

- When it changes from 0 to any other value and vice versa, or

- When it changes from null to any other value and vice versa, or

- When it increases, or

- When there is any increase or decrease in the estimated time remaining that was due to pro­ gressing insight of the server’s control logic, or

- When it changes at a rate significantly different from one unit per second.

> Changes to this attribute merely due to the normal passage of time with no other dynamic change of device state SHALL NOT be reported.
>
> As this attribute is not being reported during a regular countdown, clients SHOULD NOT rely on the reporting of this attribute in order to keep track of the remaining duration.

##### OperationalStateList Attribute

> This attribute describes the set of possible operational states that the device exposes. An opera­ tional state is a fundamental device state such as Running or Error. Details of the phase of a device when, for example, in a state of Running are provided by the CurrentPhase attribute.
>
> All devices SHALL, at a minimum, expose the set of states matching the commands that are also supported by the cluster instance, in addition to Error. The set of possible device states are defined in the [OperationalStateEnum](#operationalstateenum-type). A device type requiring implementation of this cluster SHALL define the set of states that are applicable to that specific device type.

##### OperationalState Attribute

> This attribute specifies the current operational state of a device. This SHALL be populated with a valid OperationalStateID from the set of values in the OperationalStateList Attribute.

##### OperationalError Attribute

> This attribute SHALL specify the details of any current error condition being experienced on the device when the OperationalState attribute is populated with Error. Please see [ErrorStateStruct](#errorstatestruct-type) for general requirements on the population of this attribute.
>
> When there is no error detected, this SHALL have an ErrorStateID of NoError.

> Note that it is entirely possible due to regulatory or other reasons for an instance of this cluster to expose no possible commands. When that occurs, this cluster does not provide any ability to actu­ ate the device, instead it provides readable (and by extension, can be subscribed to) information as to the state of the device only. The commands that are supported SHALL be exposed by the device in the AcceptedCommandList global attribute.

##### Pause Command

> This command SHALL be supported if the device supports remotely pausing the operation. If this command is supported, the Resume command SHALL also be supported.
>
> On receipt of this command, the device SHALL pause its operation if it is possible based on the cur­ rent function of the server. For example, if it is at a point where it is safe to do so and/or permitted, but can be restarted from the point at which pause occurred.
>
> If this command is received when already in the Paused state the device SHALL respond with an [OperationalCommandResponse](#operationalcommandresponse-command) command with an ErrorStateID of NoError but take no further action.
>
> A device that receives this command in any state which is not Pause-compatible SHALL respond
>
> with an [OperationalCommandResponse](#operationalcommandresponse-command) command with an ErrorStateID of CommandInvalidInState and SHALL take no further action.
>
> States are defined as Pause-compatible as follows:

- For states defined in this cluster specification, in [Table 3, “Pause Compatibility”](#_bookmark214).

- For states defined by derived cluster specifications, in the corresponding specifications.

- For manufacturer-specific states, by the manufacturer.

> A device that is unable to honor the Pause command for whatever reason SHALL respond with an [OperationalCommandResponse](#operationalcommandresponse-command) command with an ErrorStateID of CommandInvalidInState but take no further action.
>
> Otherwise, on success:

- The OperationalState attribute SHALL be set to Paused.

- The device SHALL respond with an [OperationalCommandResponse](#operationalcommandresponse-command) command with an ErrorStateID of NoError.

> The following table defines the compatibility of this cluster’s states with the Pause command.

##### Stop Command

> This command SHALL be supported if the device supports remotely stopping the operation.
>
> On receipt of this command, the device SHALL stop its operation if it is at a position where it is safe to do so and/or permitted. Restart of the device following the receipt of the Stop command SHALL require attended operation unless remote start is allowed by the device type and any jurisdiction governing remote operation of the device.
>
> If this command is received when already in the Stopped state the device SHALL respond with an [OperationalCommandResponse](#operationalcommandresponse-command) command with an ErrorStateID of NoError but take no further action.
>
> A device that is unable to honor the Stop command for whatever reason SHALL respond with an [OperationalCommandResponse](#operationalcommandresponse-command) command with an ErrorStateID of CommandInvalidInState but take no further action.
>
> Otherwise, on success:

- The OperationalState attribute SHALL be set to Stopped.

  - The device SHALL respond with an [OperationalCommandResponse](#operationalcommandresponse-command) command with an ErrorStateID of NoError.

##### Start Command

> This command SHALL be supported if the device supports remotely starting the operation. If this command is supported, the 'Stop command SHALL also be supported.
>
> On receipt of this command, the device SHALL start its operation if it is safe to do so and the device is in an operational state from which it can be started. There may be either regulatory or manufac­ turer-imposed safety and security requirements that first necessitate some specific action at the device before a Start command can be honored. In such instances, a device SHALL respond with a status code of CommandInvalidInState if a Start command is received prior to the required on- device action.
>
> If this command is received when already in the Running state the device SHALL respond with an [OperationalCommandResponse](#operationalcommandresponse-command) command with an ErrorStateID of NoError but take no further action.
>
> A device that is unable to honor the Start command for whatever reason SHALL respond with an [OperationalCommandResponse](#operationalcommandresponse-command) command with an ErrorStateID of UnableToStartOrResume but take no further action.
>
> Otherwise, on success:

- The OperationalState attribute SHALL be set to Running.

- The device SHALL respond with an [OperationalCommandResponse](#operationalcommandresponse-command) command with an ErrorStateID of NoError.

##### Resume Command

> This command SHALL be supported if the device supports remotely resuming the operation. If this command is supported, the Pause command SHALL also be supported.
>
> On receipt of this command, the device SHALL resume its operation from the point it was at when it received the Pause command, or from the point when it was paused by means outside of this clus­ ter (for example by manual button press).
>
> If this command is received when already in the Running state the device SHALL respond with an [OperationalCommandResponse](#operationalcommandresponse-command) command with an ErrorStateID of NoError but take no further action.
>
> A device that receives this command in any state which is not Resume-compatible SHALL respond with an [OperationalCommandResponse](#operationalcommandresponse-command) command with an ErrorStateID of CommandInvalidInState and SHALL take no further action.
>
> States are defined as Resume-compatible as follows:

- For states defined in this cluster specification, in [Table 4, “Resume Compatibility”](#_bookmark215).

- For states defined by derived cluster specifications, in the corresponding specifications.

&nbsp;

- For manufacturer-specific states, by the manufacturer.

> The following table defines the compatibility of this cluster’s states with the Resume command.
>
> *Table 4. Resume Compatibility*

| 0x03            | **Error**      | N                     |

> A device that is unable to honor the Resume command for any other reason SHALL respond with an [OperationalCommandResponse](#operationalcommandresponse-command) command with an ErrorStateID of UnableToStartOrResume but take no further action.
>
> Otherwise, on success:

- The OperationalState attribute SHALL be set to the most recent non-Error operational state prior to entering the Paused state.

- The device SHALL respond with an [OperationalCommandResponse](#operationalcommandresponse-command) command with an ErrorStateID of NoError.

##### OperationalCommandResponse Command

> This command SHALL be supported by an implementation if any of the other commands defined by this cluster are supported (i.e. listed in the AcceptedCommandList global attribute). This command SHALL also be supported by an implementation of a derived cluster as a response to any com­ mands that MAY be additionally defined therein.
>
> This command SHALL be generated in response to any of the Start, Stop, Pause, or Resume com­ mands. The data for this command SHALL be as follows:

##### Latch Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate a bitmap where each bit set in the Latch attribute SHALL indicate that the corresponding alarm will be latched when set, and will not reset to inactive when the underlying condition which caused the alarm is no longer present, and so requires an explicit reset using the Reset command.

##### State Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate a bitmap where each bit SHALL represent the state of an alarm. The value of true means the alarm is active, otherwise the alarm is inactive.

##### Supported Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate a bitmap where each bit SHALL represent whether or not an alarm is supported. The value of true means the alarm is supported, otherwise the alarm is not supported.
>
> If an alarm is not supported, the corresponding bit in Mask, Latch, and State SHALL be false.

##### PresentMessagesRequest Command

> Upon receipt, this SHALL cause the [message](#messagestruct-type) in the passed fields to be appended to the [Messages](#messages-attribute) attribute.
>
> If appending the message would cause the number of messages to be greater than the capacity of the list, the device SHALL NOT append any message to [Messages](#messages-attribute), and SHALL return a status code of RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED.
>
> When displaying a message in response to this command, an indication (ex. visual) of the origin node of the command SHALL be provided. This could be in the form of a friendly name label which uniquely identifies the node to the user. This friendly name label is typically assigned by the Matter Admin at the time of commissioning and, when it’s a device, is often editable by the user. It might be a combination of a company name and friendly name, for example, ”Acme” or “Acme Streaming Service on Alice’s Phone”.

##### NOTE

> It is currently not specified where the friendly name label can be found on the node, meaning that clients SHOULD NOT rely on a certain method they happen to observe in a particular server instance, since other instances could employ a differ­ ent method.
>
> The device SHOULD make it possible for the user to view which nodes have access to this cluster and to individually remove privileges for each node.

## Service Area Cluster

> This cluster provides an interface for controlling the areas where a device should operate, for reporting the status at each area, and for querying the current area.
>
> The device MAY operate at one area at a time, as in the case of a mobile device, such as a robot. Other devices MAY operate at (service) multiple areas simultaneously, as in the case of a sensor that can monitor multiple areas. This cluster specification uses the term "operate" to describe both the operating and servicing actions, regardless of the device type.
>
> The cluster allows the client to select one or more areas on the server, to indicate where the device SHOULD attempt to operate. An area is one of a list of options that MAY be presented by a client for a user choice, or understood by the client, via the semantic data of the area.
>
> The area semantic data is a combination of semantic tags, indicating one or more of the following: the building floor, area type, landmark, and relative position.

### Revision History

> The global ClusterRevision attribute value SHALL be the highest revision number in the table below.

| **Revision** | **Description**  |

##### SelectWhileRunning Feature

> This feature indicates whether this device allows changing the selected areas, by using the SelectAr­ eas command, while operating.

### Data Types

##### LandmarkInfoStruct Type

> The data from this structure indicates a landmark and position relative to the landmark.

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Access** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **Land­ markTag** | tag | all |  |  |  | M |
| 1 | **Relative­ Position­ Tag** | tag | all | X |  |  | M |

1.  **LandmarkTag Field**

> This field SHALL indicate that the area is associated with a landmark.
>
> This field SHALL be the ID of a landmark semantic tag, located within the [Common Landmark](#_bookmark10) [Namespace](#_bookmark10). For example, this tag MAY indicate that the area refers to an area next to a table.

2.  **RelativePositionTag Field**

> This field SHALL identify the position of the area relative to a landmark. This is a static description of a zone known to the server, and this field never reflects the device’s own proximity or position relative to the landmark, but that of the zone.
>
> This field SHALL be the ID of a relative position semantic tag, located within the [Common Relative](#_bookmark10) [Position Namespace](#_bookmark10).
>
> If the RelativePositionTag field is null, this field indicates proximity to the landmark. Otherwise, the RelativePositionTag field indicates the position of the area relative to the landmark indicated by the LandmarkTag field. For example, this tag, in conjunction with the LandmarkTag field, MAY indicate that the area refers to a zone under a table.

##### AreaInfoStruct Type

> The data from this structure indicates the name and/or semantic data describing an area, as detailed below.

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Access** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **Location­ Info** | [location­](#_bookmark8) [desc](#_bookmark8) | all | X |  |  | M |
| 1 | **Land­ markInfo** | [Landmark­](#landmarkinfostruct-type) [InfoStruct](#landmarkinfostruct-type) | all | X |  |  | M |

> This data type includes the LocationInfo field, with the following fields: LocationName, FloorNum­ ber, AreaType. Additional semantic data MAY be available in the LandmarkInfo field.
>
> For an area description to be meaningful, it SHALL have at least one of the following:

- a non-empty name (LocationInfo’s LocationName field) OR

- some semantic data (one or more of these: FloorNumber, AreaType or LandmarkTag) The normative text from the remainder of this section describes these constraints.

> If the LocationInfo field is null, the LandmarkInfo field SHALL NOT be null. If the LandmarkInfo field is null, the LocationInfo field SHALL NOT be null.
>
> If LocationInfo is not null, and its LocationName field is an empty string, at least one of the follow­ ing SHALL NOT be null:

- LocationInfo’s FloorNumber field

- LocationInfo’s AreaType field

- LandmarkInfo field

> If all three of the following are null, LocationInfo’s LocationName field SHALL NOT be an empty string:

- LocationInfo’s FloorNumber field

- LocationInfo’s AreaType field

- LandmarkInfo field

1.  **LocationInfo Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the name of the area, floor number and/or area type. A few examples are provided below.

- An area can have LocationInfo’s LocationName field set to "blue room", and the AreaType field set to the ID of a "Living Room" semantic tag. Clients wishing to direct the device to operate in (or service) the living room can use this area.

- An area can have LocationInfo set to null, the LandmarkInfo’s LandmarkTag field set to the ID of the "Table" landmark semantic tag, and the RelativePositionTag field set to the ID of the "Under" position semantic tag. With such an area indication, the client can request the device to operate in (or service) the area located under the table.

2.  **LandmarkInfo Field**

> This field SHALL indicate an association with a landmark. A value of null indicates that the infor­ mation is not available or known. For example, this may indicate that the area refers to a zone next to a table.
>
> If this field is not null, that indicates that the area is restricted to the zone where the landmark is located, as indicated by the LandmarkTag and, if not null, by the RelativePositionTag fields, rather than to the entire room or floor where the landmark is located, if those are indicated by the Loca­ tionInfo field.

##### MapStruct Type

> This is a struct representing a map.

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Access** | **Confor­ mance** |

1.  **MapID Field**

> This field SHALL represent the map’s identifier.

2.  **Name Field**

> This field SHALL represent a human understandable map description. For example: "Main Floor", or "Second Level".

##### AreaStruct Type

> This is a struct representing an area known to the server.

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Access** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **AreaID** | uint32 |  |  | MS |  | M |

| 2 | **AreaInfo** | [AreaInfoS­](#areainfostruct-type) [truct](#areainfostruct-type) |  |  | MS |  | M |

1.  **AreaID Field**

> This field SHALL represent the identifier of the area.

2.  **MapID Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the map identifier which the area is associated with. A value of null indi­ cates that the area is not associated with a map.
>
> If the SupportedMaps attribute is not empty, this field SHALL match the MapID field of an entry from the SupportedMaps attribute’s list. If the SupportedMaps attribute is empty, this field SHALL be null.

3.  **AreaInfo Field**

> This field SHALL contain data describing the area.
>
> This SHOULD be used by clients to determine the name and/or the full, or the partial, semantics of a certain area.
>
> **NOTE** If any entries on the SupportedAreas attribute’s list have the AreaInfo field missing the semantic data, the client MAY remind the user to assign the respective data.

##### ProgressStruct Type

> This is a struct indicating the progress.

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Access** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|

| 3 | **Initial­ TimeEsti­ mate** | elapsed-s |  | X | MS |  | O |

1.  **AreaID Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the identifier of the area, and the identifier SHALL be an entry in the Sup­ portedAreas attribute’s list.

2.  **Status Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the operational status of the device regarding the area indicated by the AreaID field.

3.  **TotalOperationalTime Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the total operational time, in seconds, from when the device started to operate at the area indicated by the AreaID field, until the operation finished, due to completion or due to skipping, including any time spent while paused.
>
> A value of null indicates that the total operational time is unknown.
>
> There MAY be cases where the total operational time exceeds the maximum value that can be con­ veyed by this attribute, and in such instances this attribute SHALL be populated with null.
>
> This attribute SHALL be null if the Status field is not set to Completed or Skipped.

4.  **InitialTimeEstimate Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the estimated time for the operation, in seconds, from when the device will start operating at the area indicated by the AreaID field, until the operation completes, exclud­ ing any time spent while not operating in the area.
>
> A value of null indicates that the estimated time is unknown. If the estimated time is unknown, or if it exceeds the maximum value that can be conveyed by this attribute, this attribute SHALL be null.
>
> After initializing the [ProgressStruct](#progressstruct-type) instance, the server SHOULD NOT change the value of this field, except when repopulating the entire instance, to avoid excessive reporting of the Progress attribute changes.

##### OperationalStatusEnum Type

> This data type is derived from enum8.
>
> The following table defines the status values.

| **Value** | **Name** | **Summary** | **Conformance** |

[TABLE]

##### SupportedAreas Attribute

> This attribute SHALL contain the list of areas that can be included in the SelectedAreas attribute’s list. Each item in this list represents a unique area, as indicated by the AreaID field of [AreaStruct](#areastruct-type).
>
> Each entry in this list SHALL have a unique value for the AreaID field.
>
> If the SupportedMaps attribute is not empty, each entry in this list SHALL have a unique value for the combination of the MapID and AreaInfo fields.
>
> If the SupportedMaps attribute is empty, each entry in this list SHALL have a unique value for the AreaInfo field and SHALL have the MapID field set to null.
>
> An empty value indicates that the device is currently unable to provide the list of supported areas.

##### NOTE

> due to the maximum size of this list and to the fact that the entries MAY include strings (see LocationName), care must be taken by implementers to avoid creating a data structure that is overly large, which can result in significant latency in access­ ing this attribute.
>
> The value of this attribute MAY change at any time via an out-of-band interaction outside of the server, such as interactions with a user interface, or due to internal device changes.
>
> When removing entries in the SupportedAreas attribute list the server SHALL adjust the values of the SelectedAreas, CurrentArea, and Progress attributes such that they only reference valid entries in the updated SupportedAreas attribute list. These changes to the SelectedAreas, CurrentArea, and Progress attributes MAY result in the server setting some or all of them to empty (for SelectedAreas and Progress) or null (for CurrentArea), or updating them with data that matches the constraints from the description of the respective attributes. These actions are required to ensure having a con­ sistent representation of the maps and locations available to the clients.
>
> The SupportedAreas attribute list changes mentioned above SHOULD NOT be allowed while the device is operating, to reduce the impact on the clients, and the potential confusion for the users.
>
> A few examples are provided below. Valid list of areas:

- AreaID=0, LocationName="yellow bedroom", MapID=null

- AreaID=1, LocationName="orange bedroom", MapID=null Valid list of areas:

- AreaID=5, LocationName="hallway", MapID=1

- AreaID=3, LocationName="hallway", MapID=2

##### SupportedMaps Attribute

> This attribute SHALL contain the list of supported maps.
>
> A map is a full or a partial representation of a home, known to the device. For example:

- a single level home MAY be represented using a single map

- a two level home MAY be represented using two maps, one for each level

- a single level home MAY be represented using two maps, each including a different set of rooms, such as "map of living room and kitchen" and "map of bedrooms and hallway"

- a single level home MAY be represented using one map for the indoor areas (living room, bed­ rooms etc.) and one for the outdoor areas (garden, swimming pool etc.)

> Each map includes one or more areas - see the SupportedAreas attribute. In the context of this clus­ ter specification, a map is effectively a group label for a set of areas, rather than a graphical repre­ sentation that the clients can display to the users. The clients that present the list of available areas for user selection (see the SelectAreas command) MAY choose to filter the SupportedAreas list based on the associated map. For example, the clients MAY allow the user to indicate that the device is to operate on the first floor, and allow the user to choose only from the areas situated on that level.
>
> If empty, that indicates that the device is currently unable to provide this information. Each entry in this list SHALL have a unique value for the MapID field.
>
> Each entry in this list SHALL have a unique value for the Name field.

##### NOTE

> due to the maximum size of this list and to the fact that the entries MAY include strings (see the Name field of the MapStruct data type), care must be taken by imple­ menters to avoid creating a data structure that is overly large, which can result in significant latency in accessing this attribute.
>
> The value of this attribute MAY change at any time via an out-of-band interaction outside of the server, such as interactions with a user interface.
>
> When updating the SupportedMaps attribute list by deleting entries, or by setting the attribute to an empty list, the SupportedLocations attribute SHALL be updated such that all entries in that list meet the constraints indicated in the description of the SupportedLocations attribute. This MAY result in
>
> the server removing entries from the SupportedAreas attribute list. See the SupportedAreas attribute description for the implications of changing that attribute.
>
> The SupportedMaps attribute list changes mentioned above SHOULD NOT be allowed while the device is operating, to reduce the impact on the clients, and the potential confusion for the users.

##### SelectedAreas Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the set of areas where the device SHOULD attempt to operate.
>
> The mobile devices MAY travel without operating across any areas while attempting to reach the areas indicated by the SelectedAreas attribute. For example, a robotic vacuum cleaner MAY drive without cleaning when traveling without operating.
>
> If this attribute is empty, the device is not constrained to operate in any specific areas. If this attribute is not empty:

- each item in this list SHALL match the AreaID field of an entry in the SupportedAreas attribute’s list

- each entry in this list SHALL have a unique value

##### CurrentArea Attribute

> If the device is mobile, this attribute SHALL indicate the area where the device is currently located, regardless of whether it is operating or not, such as while traveling between areas.
>
> If the device is not mobile and can operate at multiple areas sequentially, this attribute SHALL indi­ cate the area which is currently being serviced, or the area which is currently traversed by the device. For example, a camera device MAY use this attribute to indicate which area it currently takes video of (serviced area) or which area it currently has in view but not taking video of (e.g. an area which is traversed while panning).
>
> **NOTE** A device MAY traverse an area regardless of the status of the area (pending, skipped, or completed).
>
> If a device can simultaneously operate at multiple areas, such as in the case of a sensor that can monitor multiple areas at the same time, the CurrentArea attribute SHALL NOT be implemented, since it doesn’t apply. Else this attribute SHALL be optionally implemented.
>
> A null value indicates that the device is currently unable to provide this information. For example, the device is traversing an unknown area, or the SupportedAreas attribute was updated and the area where the device is located was removed from that list.
>
> If not null, the value of this attribute SHALL match the AreaID field of an entry on the SupportedAr­ eas attribute’s list.

##### EstimatedEndTime Attribute

> This attribute SHALL represent the estimated Epoch time for completing operating at the area indi­
>
> cated by the CurrentArea attribute, in seconds.
>
> A value of 0 means that the operation has completed.
>
> When this attribute is null, that represents that there is no time currently defined until operation completion. This MAY happen, for example, because no operation is in progress or because the completion time is unknown.
>
> This attribute SHALL be null if the CurrentArea attribute is null.
>
> If the Progress attribute is available, and it contains an entry matching CurrentArea, the server MAY use the time estimate provided in the InitialTimeEstimate field of that entry to compute the EstimatedEndTime attribute.
>
> The value of this attribute SHALL only be reported in the following cases:

- when it changes to or from 0

- when it decreases

- when it changes to or from null

##### NOTE

> If the device is capable of pausing its operation, this attribute MAY be set to null, to indicate that completion time is unknown, or increment the value while being in the paused state.

##### Progress Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the operating status at one or more areas. Each entry in this list SHALL have a unique value for the AreaID field.
>
> For each entry in this list, the AreaID field SHALL match an entry on the SupportedAreas attribute’s list.
>
> When this attribute is empty, that represents that no progress information is currently available.
>
> If the SelectedAreas attribute is empty, indicating the device is not constrained to operate in any specific areas, the Progress attribute list MAY change while the device operates, due to the device adding new entries dynamically, when it determines which ones it can attempt to operate at.
>
> If the SelectedAreas attribute is not empty, and the device starts operating:

- the Progress attribute list SHALL be updated so each entry of SelectedAreas has a matching Progress list entry, based on the AreaID field

- the length of the Progress and SelectedAreas list SHALL be the same

- the entries in the Progress list SHALL be initialized by the server, by having their status set to Pending or Operating, and the TotalOperationalTime field set to null

> When the device ends operation unexpectedly, such as due to an error, the server SHALL update all Progress list entries with the Status field set to Operating or Pending to Skipped.
>
> When the device finishes operating, successfully or not, it SHALL NOT change the Progress attribute, except in the case of an unexpected end of operation as described above, or due to changes to the SupportedMaps or SupportedAreas attributes, so the clients can retrieve the progress information at that time.

##### NOTE

> if the device implements the Operational Status cluster, or a derivation of it, in case the device fails to service any locations in the SelectedAreas list before ending the operation, it SHOULD use the Operational Status cluster to indicate that the device was unable to complete the operation (see the UnableToCompleteOperation error from that cluster specification). The clients SHOULD then read the Progress attribute, and indicate which areas have been successfully serviced (marked as completed).

##### SelectAreas Command

> This command is used to select a set of device areas, where the device is to operate.
>
> On receipt of this command the device SHALL respond with a SelectAreasResponse command. This command SHALL have the following data fields:

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **NewAreas** | list\[uint32\] | desc |  |  | M |

1.  **NewAreas Field**

> This field indicates which areas the device is to operate at.
>
> If this field is empty, that indicates that the device is to operate without being constrained to any specific areas, and the operation will not allow skipping using the SkipArea Command, otherwise the field SHALL be a list of unique values that match the AreaID field of entries on the Support­ edAreas list.

2.  **Effect on Receipt**

> If the NewAreas field contains any duplicated entries, the device SHALL operate on only the first instance of an entry in the list.
>
> For example, if the list \[1, 2, 2, 3, 2\] were received, the device would ignore the duplicated instances of 2 in the list and operate as if the list \[1, 2, 3\] had been received instead.
>
> If the device determines that it can’t operate at all areas from the list, the SelectAreasResponse com­ mand’s Status field SHALL indicate InvalidSet.
>
> If at least one entry on the NewAreas field doesn’t match the AreaID field of any entry of the Sup­ portedAreas list, the SelectAreasResponse command’s Status field SHALL indicate Unsupport­ edArea.
>
> If the current state of the device doesn’t allow for the areas to be selected, the SelectAreasResponse command SHALL have the Status field set to InvalidInMode.
>
> Unless the SelectWhileRunning feature indicates that selecting areas is allowed while the device is in a non-idle state, such as operating or paused, the SelectAreasResponse command SHALL have the Status field set to InvalidInMode if this restriction prevents changing the selected areas.
>
> Otherwise, if the device accepts the request, the server will attempt to operate at the areas indi­ cated by the entries of the NewArea field, the SelectAreasResponse command SHALL have the Sta­ tus field set to Success, and the SelectedAreas attribute SHALL be set to the value of the NewAreas field.
>
> **NOTE** The device MAY start to operate immediately or wait until specifically requested to operate. The behavior of the device is manufacturer specific.
>
> If the NewAreas field is the same as the value of the SelectedAreas attribute the SelectAreasRe­ sponse command SHALL have the Status field set to Success and the StatusText field MAY be sup­ plied with a human readable string or include an empty string.

##### SelectAreasResponse Command

> This command is sent by the device on receipt of the SelectAreas command. This command SHALL have the following data fields:

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **Status** | SelectAre­ asStatus | all |  |  | M |
| 1 | **StatusText** | string | max 256 |  |  | M |

1.  **Status Field**

> If the Status field is set to Success or UnsupportedArea, the server MAY use a non-empty string for the StatusText field to provide additional information. For example, if Status is set to Unsupport­
>
> edArea, the server MAY use StatusText to indicate which areas are unsupported.
>
> If the Status field is not set to Success, or UnsupportedArea, the StatusText field SHALL include a vendor-defined error description which can be used to explain the error to the user. For example, if the Status field is set to InvalidInMode, the StatusText field SHOULD indicate why the request is not allowed, given the current mode of the device, which MAY involve other clusters.

##### SkipArea Command

> This command is used to skip the given area, and to attempt operating at other areas on the Sup­ portedAreas attribute list.
>
> This command SHALL NOT be implemented if the CurrentArea attribute and the Progress attribute are both not implemented. Else, this command SHALL be optionally implemented.
>
> On receipt of this command the device SHALL respond with a SkipAreaResponse command.

1.  **SkippedArea Field**

> The SkippedArea field indicates the area to be skipped.
>
> The SkippedArea field SHALL match an entry in the SupportedAreas list.

2.  **Effect on Receipt**

> If the SelectedAreas attribute is empty, the SkipAreaResponse command’s Status field SHALL indi­ cate InvalidAreaList.
>
> If the SkippedArea field does not match an entry in the SupportedAreas attribute, the SkipAreaRe­ sponse command’s Status field SHALL indicate InvalidSkippedArea.
>
> If the SkipArea command can not be handled by the device, e.g. due to the current state, the SkipAreaResponse command’s Status field SHALL indicate InvalidInMode.
>
> Otherwise, if the device accepts the request, the device SHALL return a SkipAreaResponse with the Status field set to Success and:

- If the device is currently operating at the area identified by SkippedArea, as indicated by either the CurrentArea or the Progress attributes, if implemented, the device SHALL stop operating at that area.

- If the Progress attribute is implemented, the entry corresponding to SkippedArea SHALL be updated to indicate that the area was skipped.

- The device SHALL attempt to operate only at the areas in the SelectedAreas attribute list where

> operating has not been skipped or completed, using a vendor defined order.

- If the device has either skipped or completed operating at all areas on the SelectedAreas attribute list, the server SHALL stop operating.

##### SkipAreaResponse Command

> This command is sent by the device on receipt of the SkipArea command. This command SHALL have the following data fields:

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |

> **1.17.7.4.1. Status Field**
>
> If the Status field is set to Success or InvalidAreaList, the server MAY use a non-empty string for the StatusText field to provide additional information. For example, if Status is set to InvalidAreaList, the server MAY use StatusText to indicate why this list is invalid.
>
> If the Status field is not set to Success or InvalidAreaList, the StatusText field SHALL include a ven­ dor defined error description which can be used to explain the error to the user. For example, if the Status field is set to InvalidInMode, the StatusText field SHOULD indicate why the request is not allowed, given the current mode of the device, which MAY involve other clusters.

##### Constraint

> Where MinMeasuredValue or MaxMeasuredValue attributes are mandatory the null value MAY be used to indicate that a limit is unknown.
>
> For any measurement cluster with MeasuredValue, MinMeasuredValue and MaxMeasuredValue attributes, the following SHALL be always be true:

- If MinMeasuredValue and MaxMeasuredValue are both known, then MaxMeasuredValue SHALL be greater than MinMeasuredValue.

- If MaxMeasuredValue is known, then MeasuredValue SHALL be less than or equal to MaxMea­ suredValue.

- If MinMeasuredValue is known, then MeasuredValue SHALL be greater than or equal to Min­ MeasuredValue.

### Measurement Accuracy

> Measurement clusters MAY express the accuracy of their measurements with a [Tolerance](#tolerance-attribute) attribute expressing a simple magnitude of error, or with a [MeasurementAccuracyStruct](#measurementaccuracystruct-type) expressing magni­ tude or percentage ranges of error for different ranges of measured values.

##### Tolerance Attribute

> For any measurement cluster with a MeasuredValue and Tolerance attribute, when Tolerance is implemented the following SHALL always be true:

- The Tolerance attribute SHALL indicate the magnitude of the possible error that is associated with MeasuredValue attribute, using the same units and resolution. The true value SHALL be in the range (MeasuredValue – Tolerance) to (MeasuredValue + Tolerance).

- If known, the true value SHALL never be outside the possible physical range. Some examples:

  - a temperature SHALL NOT be below absolute zero

  - a concentration SHALL NOT be negative

## Occupancy Sensing Cluster

> The server cluster provides an interface to occupancy sensing functionality based on one or more sensing modalities, including configuration and provision of notifications of occupancy status.

### Revision History

> The global ClusterRevision attribute value SHALL be the highest revision number in the table below.

| **Revision** | **Description** |
|----|----|
| 1 | Mandatory global ClusterRevision attribute added |
| 2 | Physical Contact Occupancy feature with mandatory OccupancySen­ sorTypeBitmap |
| 3 | New data model format and notation |
| 4 | Remove nullable from PhysicalContact delay attributes and ability to not report transitions |
| 5 | Rework to add modalities: radar-, ambient-sensing- and vision-based sensors; add sensitivity setting (via co-located BooleanStateConfiguration cluster on same end­ point); add new attribute for tuning the sensor’s reporting; add event Occupancy­ Changed; add N quality for HoldTime and other timing attributes; describe how to accommodate legacy clients |

##### Backward compatibility

> With the introduction of new sensor modalities in cluster revision 5, the indication for those modal­ ities SHALL be done using feature bits. Indication of those new modalities is not feasible via the legacy attributes OccupancySensorType and OccupancySensorTypeBitmap. Servers SHALL set these attributes for backward compatibility with clients implementing a cluster revision \<= 4 as described in [OccupancySensorType and OccupancySensorTypeBitmap Attributes](#occupancysensortype-and-occupancysensortypebitmap-attributes). Clients imple­ menting a cluster revision \>= 5 SHOULD use the server’s ClusterRevision attribute, and SHOULD ignore these legacy attributes.
>
> With the same revision 5, the attribute HoldTime (along with the HoldTimeLimits) is used to deter­ mine the reporting when occupancy is no longer detected. This replaces the 9 legacy attributes PIROccupiedToUnoccupiedDelay through PhysicalContactUnoccupiedToOccupiedThreshold. Servers MAY use the applicable attributes from this set of legacy attributes if and only if HoldTime is supported (see Attribute table and [the corresponding explanation](#attributes-to-support-legacy-implementations) for details on conformance).
>
> For the case of a server which supports none of the modalities supported in ClusterRevision \<= 4 (i.e. none of PIR, US and PHY), specific mappings for the legacy attributes OccupancySensorType and OccupancySensorTypeBitmap are provided [below](#occupancysensortype-and-occupancysensortypebitmap-attributes), representing this sensor as a PIR sensor for best-effort backward compatibility. For this case, the legacy timing attributes linked to PIR (i.e. PIROccupiedToUnoccupiedDelay through PIRUnoccupiedToOccupiedThreshold) apply.

### Attributes

[TABLE]

[TABLE]

[TABLE]

##### Occupancy Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the sensed (processed) status of occupancy. For compatibility reasons this is expressed as a bitmap where the status is indicated in bit 0: a value of 1 means occupied, and 0 means unoccupied, with the other bits set to 0; this can be considered equivalent to a boolean.

##### OccupancySensorType and OccupancySensorTypeBitmap Attributes

> These attributes SHALL indicate the type of sensor. In ClusterRevision \<= 4, these were used to spec­ ify the type of the occupancy sensor using a bitmap. For ClusterRevision \>= 5, the server SHALL indicate the type of sensor using the feature flags, and the server SHALL provide these attributes for the backward compatibility with clients implementing a cluster revision \<= 4, using the mapping according to the following table. Also see [Backward Compatibility section](#backward-compatibility).

[TABLE]

> ^(\*) In case the feature flags PIR, US and PHY are all set to 0, these attributes are set to mimic a PIR sen­ sor since this likely will give the best compatibility with clients implementing a cluster revision \<= 4, which are not aware of the feature flags and the added modalities. In this case, timing parameters (when HoldTime is supported) are expressed using the PIROccupiedToUnoccupiedDelay, PIRUnoc­ cupiedToOccupiedDelay and PIRUnoccupiedToOccupiedThreshold attributes.
>
> ^(\*\*) These combinations of sensor type were not defined for OccupancySensorType in ClusterRevision
>
> \<= 4, so they are mapped to a combination which *was* defined in that version.

##### HoldTime Attribute

> This attribute SHALL specify the time delay, in seconds, before the sensor changes to its unoccupied state after the last detection of occupancy in the sensed area. This is equivalent to the legacy \*Occu­ piedToUnoccupiedDelay attributes.
>
> The value of HoldTime SHALL be within the limits provided in the HoldTimeLimits attribute, i.e. HoldTimeMin \<= HoldTime \<= HoldTimeMax
>
> Low values of HoldTime SHOULD be avoided since they could lead to many reporting messages. A value 0 for HoldTime SHALL NOT be used.
>
> The figure below illustrates this with an example of how this attribute is used for a PIR sensor. It uses threshold detection to generate an "internal detection" signal, which needs post-processing to become usable for transmission (traffic shaping). The bit in the Occupancy attribute will be set to 1 when the internal detection signal goes high, and will stay at 1 for HoldTime after the (last) instance where the internal detection signal goes low.
>
> The top half of the figure shows the case of a single trigger: the bit in the Occupancy attribute will be 1 for the duration of the PIR signal exceeding the threshold plus HoldTime. The bottom half of the figure shows the case of multiple triggers: the second trigger starts before the HoldTime of the first trigger has expired; this results in a single period of the bit in the Occupancy attribute being 1. The bit in the Occupancy attribute will be set to 1 from the start of the first period where the PIR signal exceeds the threshold until HoldTime after the last moment where the PIR exceeded the threshold.
>

>
> *Figure 13. Processing of PIR signal towards Occupancy attribute using HoldTime*

##### HoldTimeLimits Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the server’s limits, and default value, for the HoldTime attribute.

##### Attributes to support legacy implementations

> The following 3 sets of 3 attributes each were used in ClusterRevision \<= 4 to indicate timings and conditions to tune the reporting by the sensor - separately for each of the three sensor modalities defined in that revision. In ClusterRevision \>= 5, these are replaced by the HoldTime attribute (shared for all modalities). A server with ClusterRevision \>= 5 MAY (under the conformance condi­ tions stated in the attributes table above) provide these attributes for backward compatibility with clients implementing a cluster revision \<= 4. When doing so, the provided values for these legacy
>
> \*OccupiedToUnoccupied attributes SHALL follow the values in the HoldTime attribute when updated, and vice-versa, such that any present \*OccupiedToUnoccupiedDelay attribute maintains equality to HoldTime.
>
> Also see [Backward Compatibility section](#backward-compatibility).
>
> Some, but not all, of the implications of the conformance rules for these attributes are:

- if attribute HoldTime is not supported, these 9 legacy attributes SHALL NOT be supported

- if modality PIR is supported, while both PHY and US modalities are not supported,

  - the 3 legacy attributes related to PIR MAY be supported (if allowed by the other rules)

  - the 6 legacy attributes related to Ultrasonic and PhysicalContact SHALL NOT be supported

- if modality US is supported while both PIR and PHY modalities are not supported:

  - the 3 legacy attributes related to UltraSonic MAY be supported (if allowed by the other rules)

  - the 6 legacy attributes related to PIR and PhysicalContact SHALL NOT be supported

- if modality PHY is supported while both PIR and US modalities are not supported:

  - the 3 legacy attributes related to PhysicalContact MAY be supported (if allowed by the other rules)

  - the 6 legacy attributes related to PIR and Ultrasonic SHALL NOT be supported

- the legacy attributes related to UnoccupiedToOccupiedDelay and UnoccupiedToOccu­ piedThreshold for a certain modality SHALL be both supported or both not supported

- if none of the modalities PIR, US, and PHY is supported (this case is presented as a PIR sensor for compatibility):

  - the 3 legacy attributes related to PIR MAY be supported (if allowed by the other rules)

  - the 6 legacy attributes related to Ultrasonic and PhysicalContact SHALL NOT be supported

> For cases where more than one of the PIR, PHY and US modalities is supported *and* the timing para­ meters are provided for more than one modality, it is manufacturer specific how to combine those timing parameters.

> This attribute SHALL specify the time delay, in seconds, before the PIR sensor changes to its unoccu­ pied state after the last detection of occupancy in the sensed area.

> This attribute SHALL specify the time delay, in seconds, before the physical contact occupancy sen­ sor changes to its unoccupied state after detecting the unoccupied event.

##### PhysicalContactUnoccupiedToOccupiedDelay Attribute

> This attribute SHALL specify the time delay, in seconds, before the physical contact sensor changes to its occupied state after the first detection of the occupied event.

##### ExpressedState Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the visibly- and audibly-expressed state of the alarm. When multiple alarm conditions are being reflected in the server, this attribute SHALL indicate the condition with the highest priority. Priority order of conditions is determined by the manufacturer and SHALL be supplied as a part of certification procedure. If the value of ExpressedState is not Normal, the attribute corresponding to the value SHALL NOT be Normal. For example, if the ExpressedState is set to SmokeAlarm, the value of the SmokeState will indicate the severity of the alarm (Warning or Critical). Clients SHOULD also read the other attributes to be aware of further alarm conditions beyond the one indicated in ExpressedState.
>
> Visible expression is typically a LED light pattern. Audible expression is a horn or speaker pattern. Audible expression SHALL BE suppressed if the DeviceMuted attribute is supported and set to Muted.

##### SmokeState Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate whether the device’s smoke sensor is currently triggering a smoke alarm.

##### COState Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate whether the device’s CO sensor is currently triggering a CO alarm.

##### BatteryAlert Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate whether the power resource fault detection mechanism is currently triggered at the device. If the detection mechanism is triggered, this attribute SHALL be set to Warn­ ing or Critical, otherwise it SHALL be set to Normal. The battery state SHALL also be reflected in the Power Source cluster representing the device’s battery using the appropriate supported attributes and events.

##### DeviceMuted Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the whether the audible expression of the device is currently muted. Audible expression is typically a horn or speaker pattern.

##### TestInProgress Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate whether the device self-test is currently activated. If the device self- test is activated, this attribute SHALL be set to True, otherwise it SHALL be set to False.

##### HardwareFaultAlert Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate whether the hardware fault detection mechanism is currently trig­ gered. If the detection mechanism is triggered, this attribute SHALL be set to True, otherwise it SHALL be set to False.

##### EndOfServiceAlert Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate whether the end-of-service has been triggered at the device. This attribute SHALL be set to Expired when the device reaches the end-of-service.

##### InterconnectSmokeAlarm Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate whether the interconnected smoke alarm is currently triggering by branching devices. When the interconnected smoke alarm is being triggered, this attribute SHALL be set to Warning or Critical, otherwise it SHALL be set to Normal.

##### InterconnectCOAlarm Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate whether the interconnected CO alarm is currently triggering by branching devices. When the interconnected CO alarm is being triggered, this attribute SHALL be set to Warning or Critical, otherwise it SHALL be set to Normal.

##### ContaminationState Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the contamination level of the smoke sensor.

##### SmokeSensitivityLevel Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the sensitivity level of the smoke sensor configured on the device.

##### ExpiryDate Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the date when the device reaches its stated expiry date. After the ExpiryDate has been reached, the EndOfServiceAlert SHALL start to be triggered. To account for better customer experience across time zones, the EndOfServiceAlert MAY be delayed by up to 24 hours after the ExpiryDate. Similarly, clients MAY delay any actions based on the ExpiryDate by up to 24 hours to best align with the local time zone.

## General Description

### Introduction

> The clusters specified in this document are for use typically in lighting applications, but MAY be used in any application domain.

### Terms

> **Ballast Factor:** A measure of the light output (lumens) of a ballast and lamp combination in com­ parison to an ANSI standard ballast operated with the same lamp. Multiply the ballast factor by the rated lumens of the lamp to get the light output of the lamp/ballast combination.
>
> **HSV:** Hue, Saturation, Value. A color space, also known as HSB (Hue, Saturation, Brightness). This is a well-known transformation of the RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color space. For more information see e.g., <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSV_color_space>.
>
> **Illuminance:** The density of incident luminous flux on a surface. Illuminance is the standard met­ ric for lighting levels, and is measured in lux (lx).

### Cluster List

> This section lists the lighting specific clusters as specified in this chapter.
>
> *Table 6. Overview of the Lighting Clusters*

| **Cluster ID** | **Cluster Name** | **Description** |
|----|----|----|
| 0x0300 | [Color Control](#color-control-cluster) | Attributes and commands for controlling the color of a color- capable light. |
| 0x0301 | [Ballast Configuration](#ballast-configuration-cluster) | Attributes and commands for configuring a lighting ballast |

## Color Control Cluster

> This cluster provides an interface for changing the color of a light. Color is specified according to the [CIE 1931 Color space](#_bookmark12). Color control is carried out in terms of x,y values, as defined by this speci­ fication.
>
> Additionally, color MAY optionally be controlled in terms of color temperature, or as hue and satu­
>
> ration values based on optionally variable RGB and W color points. It is recommended that the hue and saturation are interpreted according to the HSV (a.k.a. HSB) color model.
>
> Control over luminance is not included, as this is provided by means of the Level Control for Light­ ing cluster. It is recommended that the level provided by this cluster be interpreted as representing a proportion of the maximum intensity achievable at the current color.

### Revision History

> The global ClusterRevision attribute value SHALL be the highest revision number in the table below.

### Features

> This cluster SHALL support the FeatureMap bitmap attribute as defined below.

| **Bit** | **Code** | **Feature** | **Conformance** | **Summary** |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **HS** | HueSaturation | EHUE, O | Supports color specification via hue/saturation. |
| 1 | **EHUE** | EnhancedHue | CL, O | Enhanced hue is supported. |
| 2 | **CL** | ColorLoop | O | Color loop is sup­ ported. |

### Dependencies

##### Coupling color temperature to Level Control

> If the Level Control for Lighting cluster identifier 0x0008 is supported on the same endpoint as the Color Control cluster and color temperature is supported, it is possible to couple changes in the cur­ rent level to the color temperature.
>
> The CoupleColorTempToLevel bit of the Options attribute of the Level Control cluster indicates whether the color temperature is to be linked with the CurrentLevel attribute in the Level Control cluster.
>
> If the CoupleColorTempToLevel bit of the Options attribute of the Level Control cluster is equal to 1 and the ColorMode or EnhancedColorMode attribute is set to 2 (ColorTemperatureMireds) then a change in the CurrentLevel attribute SHALL affect the ColorTemperatureMireds attribute. This rela­ tionship is manufacturer specific, with the qualification that the maximum value of the Cur­ rentLevel attribute SHALL correspond to a ColorTemperatureMired attribute value equal to the CoupleColorTempToLevelMinMireds attribute. This relationship is one-way so a change to the Col­ orTemperatureMireds attribute SHALL NOT have any effect on the CurrentLevel attribute.
>
> In order to simulate the behavior of an incandescent bulb, a low value of the CurrentLevel attribute SHALL be associated with a high value of the ColorTemperatureMireds attribute (i.e., a low value of color temperature in kelvins).
>
> If the CoupleColorTempToLevel bit of the Options attribute of the Level Control cluster is equal to 0, there SHALL be no link between color temperature and current level.

##### Independent transition in hue and saturation

> Various commands in this cluster can be used to start transitions in hue and/or saturation.

- When a transition in hue is in progress, and a command to change saturation (MoveSaturation

> (with MoveMode!=Stop), StepSaturation, MoveToSaturation) is received by the server, this latter command SHALL NOT interrupt the ongoing transition in hue.

- When a transition in saturation is in progress, and a command to change hue (MoveHue (with MoveMode!=Stop), EnhancedMoveHue (with MoveMode!=Stop) StepHue, EnhancedStepHue, MoveToHue, EnhancedMoveToHue) is received by the server, this latter command SHALL NOT interrupt the ongoing transition in saturation.

If the implicit form of the ExtensionFieldSetStruct is used, the order of the attributes in the AttributeValueList is in the given order, i.e., the attribute listed as 1 is added first:

1.  CurrentX (0)

2.  CurrentY (0)

3.  EnhancedCurrentHue (null)

4.  CurrentSaturation (null)

5.  ColorLoopActive (0)

6.  ColorLoopDirection (0)

7.  ColorLoopTime (0)

8.  ColorTemperatureMireds (null)

9.  EnhancedColorMode

> Since there is a direct relation between ColorTemperatureMireds and XY, color temperature, if sup­ ported, is stored as XY in the scenes table.
>
> Attributes in the scene table that are not supported by the device (according to the FeatureMap attribute) SHALL be present in the scene table but ignored.
>
> If the Scenes Management cluster server is implemented on the same endpoint, and the cluster revision is 6 or above, then all extension fields in the list above, including up to EnhancedColor­ Mode (item 9), SHALL be present in the extension fields set for a Scene to be considered valid. This disambiguates the color mode used within the Scene.

##### Generic Usage Notes

> When asked to change color via one of these commands, the implementation SHALL select a color, within the limits of the hardware of the device, which is as close as possible to that requested. The determination as to the true representations of color is out of the scope of this specification. How­ ever, as long as the color data fields of the received command are within the permitted range of this specification and no error condition applies, the resulting status code SHALL be SUCCESS.
>
> For example the MoveToColorTemperature command: if the target color temperature is not achiev­ able by the hardware then the color temperature SHALL be clipped at the physical minimum or maximum achievable (depending on the direction of the color temperature transition) when the device reaches that color temperature (which MAY be before the requested transition time).
>
> If a color loop is active (i.e., the ColorLoopActive attribute is equal to 1), it SHALL only be stopped by sending a specific ColorLoopSet command frame with a request to deactivate the color loop (i.e., the color loop SHALL NOT be stopped on receipt of another command which has a 'stop' semantic such as the EnhancedMoveToHue command with MoveMode==Stop, or the StopMoveStep com­ mand). In addition, while a color loop is active, a manufacturer MAY choose to ignore incoming color commands which affect a change in hue.

##### Note on Change of ColorMode

> The first action taken when any one of these commands is received is to change the ColorMode attribute to the appropriate value for the command (see individual commands). Note that, when moving from one color mode to another (e.g., CurrentX/CurrentY to CurrentHue/CurrentSatura­ tion), the starting color for the command is formed by calculating the values of the new attributes (in this case CurrentHue, CurrentSaturation) from those of the old attributes (in this case CurrentX and CurrentY).
>
> When moving from a mode to another mode that has a more restricted color range (e.g., Cur­ rentX/CurrentY to CurrentHue/CurrentSaturation, or CurrentHue/CurrentSaturation to ColorTem­ peratureMireds) it is possible for the current color value to have no equivalent in the new mode. The behavior in such cases is manufacturer dependent, and therefore it is recommended to avoid
>
> color mode changes of this kind during use.

##### Use of the OptionsMask and OptionsOverride Fields

> The OptionsMask and OptionsOverride Fields SHALL both be present. Default values are provided to interpret missing fields from legacy devices. A temporary Options bitmap SHALL be created from the Options attribute, using the OptionsMask and OptionsOverride Fields. Each bit of the temporary Options bitmap SHALL be determined as follows:
>
> Each bit in the Options attribute SHALL determine the corresponding bit in the temporary Options bitmap, unless the OptionsMask field is present and has the corresponding bit set to 1, in which case the corresponding bit in the OptionsOverride field SHALL determine the corresponding bit in the temporary Options bitmap.
>
> The resulting temporary Options bitmap SHALL then be processed as defined in section [Options](#options-attribute-1).

5.  **Effect on Receipt**

> On receipt of this command, a device SHALL also set the ColorMode attribute to the value 0 and then SHALL move from its current hue to the value given in the Hue field.
>
> The movement SHALL be continuous, i.e., not a step function, and the time taken to move to the new hue SHALL be equal to the TransitionTime field.
>
> As hue is effectively measured on a circle, the new hue MAY be moved to in either direction. The direction of hue change is given by the Direction field. If Direction is 'Shortest distance', the direc­ tion is taken that involves the shortest path round the circle. This case corresponds to expected nor­ mal usage. If Direction is 'Longest distance', the direction is taken that involves the longest path round the circle. This case can be used for 'rainbow effects'. In both cases, if both distances are the same, the Up direction SHALL be taken.

### The Dimming Light Curve

> The dimming curve is recommended to be logarithmic, as defined by the following equation:

![](media/image59.png)

> Where: %Light is the percent light output of the ballast and
>
> Level is an 8-bit integer between 1 (0.1% light output) and 254 (100% output) that is adjusted for MinLevel and MaxLevel using the following equation:
>
> Level = (MaxLevel – MinLevel) \* CurrentLevel / 253 + (254 \* MinLevel – MaxLevel) / 253.
>
> **Note 1:** Value 255 is not used.
>
> **Note 2:** The light output is determined by this curve together with the IntrinsicBallastFactor and BallastFactorAdjustment attributes.

### Dependencies

> Where external pressure, flow, and temperature measurements are processed by this cluster (see [ControlMode](#controlmode-attribute) attribute), these are provided by a Pressure Measurement cluster, a Flow Measure­ ment cluster, and a Temperature Measurement client cluster, respectively. These 3 client clusters are used for connection to a remote sensor device. The pump is able to use the sensor measurement provided by a remote sensor for regulation of the pump speed.
>
> Note that control of the pump setpoint is not included in this cluster – the On/Off and Level Control clusters (see [Typical Usage of Pump Configuration and Control Cluster](#_bookmark471)) MAY be used by a pump device to turn it on and off and control its setpoint. Note that the Pump Configuration and Control cluster MAY override on/off/setpoint settings for specific operation modes (See [OperationMode](#operationmode-attribute) attribute for detailed description of the operation and control of the pump.).

##### OperationModeEnum Type

> This data type is derived from enum8.

| **Value** | **Name** | **Summary** | **Conformance** |
|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **Normal** | The pump is controlled by a setpoint, as defined by a connected remote sensor or by the ControlMode attribute. | M |
| 1 | **Minimum** | This value sets the pump to run at the minimum possible speed it can without being stopped. | SPD |
| 2 | **Maximum** | This value sets the pump to run at its max­ imum possible speed. | SPD |
| 3 | **Local** | This value sets the pump to run with the local settings of the pump, regardless of what these are. | LOCAL |

1.  **Normal Value**

> If the pump is running in this operation mode the setpoint is an internal variable which MAY be controlled between 0% and 100%, e.g., by means of the Level Control cluster

##### ControlModeEnum Type

> This data type is derived from enum8.

| **Value** | **Name** | **Summary** | **Conformance** |
|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **ConstantSpeed** | The pump is running at a constant speed. | SPD |
| 1 | **ConstantPressure** | The pump will regulate its speed to maintain a constant differential pressure over its flanges. | PRSCONST |
| 2 | **ProportionalPressure** | The pump will regulate its speed to maintain a constant differential pressure over its flanges. | PRSCOMP |

3.  **ConstantPressure Value**

> The setpoint is interpreted as a percentage of the range of the sensor used for this control mode. In case of the internal pressure sensor, this will be the range derived from the \[MinConstPressure – MaxConstPressure\] attributes. In case of a remote pressure sensor, this will be the range derived from the \[MinMeasuredValue – MaxMeasuredValue\] attributes of the remote pressure sensor.

4.  **ProportionalPressure Value**

> The setpoint is interpreted as a percentage of the range derived of the \[MinCompPressure – Max­
>
> CompPressure\] attributes. The internal setpoint will be lowered (compensated) dependent on the flow in the pump (lower flow ⇒ lower internal setpoint).

5.  **ConstantFlow Value**

> The setpoint is interpreted as a percentage of the range of the sensor used for this control mode. In case of the internal flow sensor, this will be the range derived from the \[MinConstFlow – MaxConst­ Flow\] attributes. In case of a remote flow sensor, this will be the range derived from the \[MinMea­ suredValue – MaxMeasuredValue\] attributes of the remote flow sensor.

6.  **ConstantTemperature Value**

> The setpoint is interpreted as a percentage of the range of the sensor used for this control mode. In case of the internal temperature sensor, this will be the range derived from the \[MinConstTemp – MaxConstTemp\] attributes. In case of a remote temperature sensor, this will be the range derived from the \[MinMeasuredValue – MaxMeasuredValue\] attributes of the remote temperature sensor.

7.  **Automatic Value**

> This behavior is manufacturer defined. The pump can be stopped by setting the setpoint of the level control cluster to 0, or by using the On/Off cluster. If the pump is started (at any setpoint), the speed of the pump is entirely determined by the pump.

##### OperationMode Attribute

> This attribute specifies the operation mode of the pump as defined in [OperationModeEnum](#operationmodeenum-type).
>
> The actual operating mode of the pump is a result of the setting of the attributes OperationMode, ControlMode and the optional connection of a remote sensor. The operation and control is priori­ tized as shown in the scheme below:
>
> *Priority Scheme of Pump Operation and Control*

![](media/image60.jpeg)

> If this attribute is Maximum, Minimum or Local, the OperationMode attribute decides how the pump is operated.
>
> If this attribute is Normal and a remote sensor is connected to the pump, the type of the remote sen­ sor decides the control mode of the pump. A connected remote pressure sensor will make the pump run in control mode Constant pressure and vice versa for flow and temperature type sensors. This is regardless of the setting of the ControlMode attribute.
>
> If this attribute is Normal and no remote sensor is connected, the control mode of the pump is decided by the ControlMode attribute.
>
> OperationMode MAY be changed at any time, even when the pump is running. The behavior of the pump at the point of changing the value of this attribute is vendor-specific.
>
> In the case a device does not support a specific operation mode, the write interaction to this attribute with an unsupported operation mode value SHALL be ignored and a response containing the status of CONSTRAINT_ERROR SHALL be returned.

##### ControlMode Attribute

> This attribute specifies the control mode of the pump as defined in [ControlModeEnum](#controlmodeenum-type).
>
> See the [OperationMode](#operationmode-attribute) attribute for a detailed description of the operation and control of the pump.
>
> ControlMode MAY be changed at any time, even when the pump is running. The behavior of the pump at the point of changing is vendor-specific.
>
> In the case a device does not support a specific control mode, the write interaction to this attribute with an unsupported control mode value SHALL be ignored and a response containing the status of CONSTRAINT_ERROR SHALL be returned.

### Features

> This cluster SHALL support the FeatureMap bitmap attribute as defined below.

| **Bit** | **Code** | **Feature** | **Conformance** | **Summary** |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **HEAT** | Heating | AUTO, O.a+ | Thermostat is capable of manag­ ing a heating device |
| 1 | **COOL** | Cooling | AUTO, O.a+ | Thermostat is capable of manag­ ing a cooling device |
| 2 | **OCC** | Occupancy | O | Supports Occupied and Unoccupied setpoints |

| **Bit** | **Code** | **Feature** | **Conformance** | **Summary** |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| 3 | **SCH** | ScheduleConfigu­ ration | \[Zigbee\], D | Supports remote configuration of a weekly schedule of setpoint transi­ tions |
| 4 | **SB** | Setback | O | Supports config­ urable setback (or span) |
| 5 | **AUTO** | AutoMode | O | Supports a System Mode of Auto |
| 6 | **LTNE** | LocalTempera­ tureNotExposed | O | Thermostat does not expose the LocalTemperature Value in the Local­ Temperature attribute |
| 7 | **MSCH** | MatterSchedule­ Configuration | O | Supports enhanced sched­ ules |
| 8 | **PRES** | Presets | O | Thermostat sup­ ports setpoint pre­ sets |

##### LocalTemperatureNotExposed Feature

> This feature indicates that the [Calculated Local Temperature](#calculated-local-temperature) used internally is unavailable to report externally, for example due to the temperature control being done by a separate subsystem which does not offer a view into the currently measured temperature, but allows setpoints to be provided.

### Units of Temperature

> Temperatures within this cluster are represented by types using units of degree Celsius.
>
> The temperature data type used throughout this cluster is defined in the Derived Data Types section of the Data Model.
>
> The following temperature-related data types are also defined in and used throughout this cluster:

- [TemperatureDifference](#temperaturedifference-type)

- [SignedTemperature](#signedtemperature-type)

- [UnsignedTemperature](#unsignedtemperature-type)

> While temperature values MUST be transferred over the air using these types, this does not limit how Thermostats may display or store temperature values. Thermostats which display temperature
>
> values SHOULD follow the recommendations in [Conversion of Temperature Values for Display](#conversion-of-temperature-values-for-display).

##### CAUTION

> *Calculations with temperature attributes*
>
> Where calculations or comparisons are performed, attribute values must be converted to a common type. In many cases, it is not sufficient to simply use the integer representation as the scaling from °C to integer value differs.

### Setpoint Limits

> There are a number of attributes which impose limits on setpoint values. This imposes constraints which MUST be maintained by any mechanism which modifies a limit or setpoint. Individual attribute descriptions detail the actions to be taken should a conflict arise while modifying the value.
>
> User configurable limits must be within device limits:

- [AbsMinHeatSetpointLimit](#absminheatsetpointlimit-attribute) \<= [MinHeatSetpointLimit](#minheatsetpointlimit-attribute) \<= [MaxHeatSetpointLimit](#maxheatsetpointlimit-attribute) \<= [AbsMaxHeat­](#absmaxheatsetpointlimit-attribute) [SetpointLimit](#absmaxheatsetpointlimit-attribute)

- [AbsMinCoolSetpointLimit](#absmincoolsetpointlimit-attribute) \<= [MinCoolSetpointLimit](#mincoolsetpointlimit-attribute) \<= [MaxCoolSetpointLimit](#maxcoolsetpointlimit-attribute) \<= [AbsMaxCoolSet­](#absmaxcoolsetpointlimit-attribute) [pointLimit](#absmaxcoolsetpointlimit-attribute)

> Setpoints must be within user configurable limits:

- [MinHeatSetpointLimit](#minheatsetpointlimit-attribute) \<= [OccupiedHeatingSetpoint](#occupiedheatingsetpoint-attribute) \<= [MaxHeatSetpointLimit](#maxheatsetpointlimit-attribute)

- [MinCoolSetpointLimit](#mincoolsetpointlimit-attribute) \<= [OccupiedCoolingSetpoint](#occupiedcoolingsetpoint-attribute) \<= [MaxCoolSetpointLimit](#maxcoolsetpointlimit-attribute)

- [MinHeatSetpointLimit](#minheatsetpointlimit-attribute) \<= [UnoccupiedHeatingSetpoint](#unoccupiedheatingsetpoint-attribute) \<= [MaxHeatSetpointLimit](#maxheatsetpointlimit-attribute)

- [MinCoolSetpointLimit](#mincoolsetpointlimit-attribute) \<= [UnoccupiedCoolingSetpoint](#unoccupiedcoolingsetpoint-attribute) \<= [MaxCoolSetpointLimit](#maxcoolsetpointlimit-attribute)

> If, and only if, the AUTO feature is supported, a deadband must be maintained between Heating and Cooling setpoints and limits:

- [AbsMinHeatSetpointLimit](#absminheatsetpointlimit-attribute) \<= ([AbsMinCoolSetpointLimit](#absmincoolsetpointlimit-attribute) - [MinSetpointDeadBand](#minsetpointdeadband-attribute))

- [AbsMaxHeatSetpointLimit](#absmaxheatsetpointlimit-attribute) \<= ([AbsMaxCoolSetpointLimit](#absmaxcoolsetpointlimit-attribute) - [MinSetpointDeadBand](#minsetpointdeadband-attribute))

- [MinHeatSetpointLimit](#minheatsetpointlimit-attribute) \<= ([MinCoolSetpointLimit](#mincoolsetpointlimit-attribute) - [MinSetpointDeadBand](#minsetpointdeadband-attribute))

- [MaxHeatSetpointLimit](#maxheatsetpointlimit-attribute) \<= ([MaxCoolSetpointLimit](#maxcoolsetpointlimit-attribute) - [MinSetpointDeadBand](#minsetpointdeadband-attribute))

- [OccupiedHeatingSetpoint](#occupiedheatingsetpoint-attribute) \<= ([OccupiedCoolingSetpoint](#occupiedcoolingsetpoint-attribute) - [MinSetpointDeadBand](#minsetpointdeadband-attribute))

- [UnoccupiedHeatingSetpoint](#unoccupiedheatingsetpoint-attribute) \<= ([UnoccupiedCoolingSetpoint](#unoccupiedcoolingsetpoint-attribute) - [MinSetpointDeadBand](#minsetpointdeadband-attribute))

##### Calculated Local Temperature

> The local temperature SHALL be calculated from the *measured temperature*, including any adjust­ ments applied by [LocalTemperatureCalibration](#localtemperaturecalibration-attribute) attribute (if any) as follows:
>
> The *measured temperature* value may be local, or remote, depending on the value of the [Remote­](#remotesensing-attribute) [Sensing](#remotesensing-attribute) attribute when supported.
>
> All setpoint attributes in the Thermostat cluster SHALL be triggered based off this calculated value (i.e., measured temperature and any calibration offset).
>
> If the LocalTemperatureNotExposed feature is present, the behavior of the thermostat SHALL be that the equipment’s temperature control uses the calculated local temperature even if that value is not reported in the [LocalTemperature](#localtemperature-attribute) attribute.

##### LocalTemperature Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the current [Calculated Local Temperature](#calculated-local-temperature), when available.

- If the LTNE feature is not supported:

  - If the [LocalTemperatureCalibration](#localtemperaturecalibration-attribute) is invalid or currently unavailable, the attribute SHALL report null.

  - If the [LocalTemperatureCalibration](#localtemperaturecalibration-attribute) is valid, the attribute SHALL report that value.

- Otherwise, if the LTNE feature is supported, there is no feedback externally available for the [LocalTemperatureCalibration](#localtemperaturecalibration-attribute). In that case, the LocalTemperature attribute SHALL always report null.

##### OutdoorTemperature Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the outdoor temperature, as measured locally or remotely (over the network).

##### Occupancy Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate whether the heated/cooled space is occupied or not, as measured locally or remotely (over the network).

##### AbsMinHeatSetpointLimit Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the absolute minimum level that the heating setpoint MAY be set to. This is a limitation imposed by the manufacturer.
>
> Refer to [Setpoint Limits](#setpoint-limits) for constraints

##### AbsMaxHeatSetpointLimit Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the absolute maximum level that the heating setpoint MAY be set to. This is a limitation imposed by the manufacturer.
>
> Refer to [Setpoint Limits](#setpoint-limits) for constraints

##### AbsMinCoolSetpointLimit Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the absolute minimum level that the cooling setpoint MAY be set to. This is a limitation imposed by the manufacturer.
>
> Refer to [Setpoint Limits](#setpoint-limits) for constraints

##### AbsMaxCoolSetpointLimit Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the absolute maximum level that the cooling setpoint MAY be set to. This is a limitation imposed by the manufacturer.
>
> Refer to [Setpoint Limits](#setpoint-limits) for constraints

##### PICoolingDemand Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the level of cooling demanded by the PI (proportional integral) con­ trol loop in use by the thermostat (if any), in percent. This value is 0 when the thermostat is in “off” or “heating” mode.
>
> This attribute is reported regularly and MAY be used to control a cooling device.

##### PIHeatingDemand Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the level of heating demanded by the PI loop in percent. This value is 0 when the thermostat is in “off” or “cooling” mode.
>
> This attribute is reported regularly and MAY be used to control a heating device.

##### HVACSystemTypeConfiguration Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the HVAC system type controlled by the thermostat. If the thermostat uses physical DIP switches to set these parameters, this information SHALL be available read-only
>
> from the DIP switches. If these parameters are set via software, there SHALL be read/write access in order to provide remote programming capability.

##### LocalTemperatureCalibration Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the offset the Thermostat server SHALL make to the measured tem­ perature (locally or remotely) to adjust the [Calculated Local Temperature](#calculated-local-temperature) prior to using, displaying or reporting it.
>
> The purpose of this attribute is to adjust the calibration of the Thermostat server per the user’s preferences (e.g., to match if there are multiple servers displaying different values for the same HVAC area) or compensate for variability amongst temperature sensors.
>
> If a Thermostat client attempts to write [LocalTemperatureCalibration](#localtemperaturecalibration-attribute) attribute to an unsupported value (e.g., out of the range supported by the Thermostat server), the Thermostat server SHALL respond with a status of SUCCESS and set the value of [LocalTemperatureCalibration](#localtemperaturecalibration-attribute) to the upper or lower limit reached.
>
> **NOTE** Prior to revision 8 of this cluster specification the value of this attribute was con­ strained to a range of -2.5°C to 2.5°C.

##### OccupiedCoolingSetpoint Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the cooling mode setpoint when the room is occupied. Refer to [Setpoint Limits](#setpoint-limits) for constraints.
>

If hold status is on, the thermostat SHOULD maintain the temperature setpoint for the current mode until a system mode change. If hold status is off, the thermostat SHOULD follow the setpoint transitions specified by its internal scheduling program. If the thermostat supports setpoint hold for a specific duration, it SHOULD also implement the [TemperatureSetpointHoldDuration](#temperaturesetpointholdduration-attribute) attribute.
>
> If the server supports a setpoint hold for a specific duration, it SHOULD also implement the [Set­](#setpointholdexpirytimestamp-attribute) [pointHoldExpiryTimestamp](#setpointholdexpirytimestamp-attribute) attribute.
>

##### TemperatureSetpointHoldDuration Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the period in minutes for which a setpoint hold is active. Thermostats that support hold for a specified duration SHOULD implement this attribute. The null value indi­ cates the field is unused. All other values are reserved.
>
> If this attribute is updated to a non-null value and the [TemperatureSetpointHold](#temperaturesetpointhold-attribute) is set to Set­ pointHoldOn and the [SetpointHoldExpiryTimestamp](#setpointholdexpirytimestamp-attribute) is supported, the server SHALL update [Set­](#setpointholdexpirytimestamp-attribute) [pointHoldExpiryTimestamp](#setpointholdexpirytimestamp-attribute) with a value of current UTC timestamp, in seconds, plus the new value of this attribute multiplied by 60.
>
> If this attribute is set to null and the [SetpointHoldExpiryTimestamp](#setpointholdexpirytimestamp-attribute) is supported, the server SHALL set the [SetpointHoldExpiryTimestamp](#setpointholdexpirytimestamp-attribute) to null.

##### ThermostatProgrammingOperationMode Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the operational state of the thermostat’s programming. The thermo­ stat SHALL modify its programming operation when this attribute is modified by a client and update this attribute when its programming operation is modified locally by a user. The thermostat MAY support more than one active [ProgrammingOperationModeBitmap](#programmingoperationmodebitmap-type). For example, the thermo­ stat MAY operate simultaneously in Schedule Programming Mode and Recovery Mode.
>
> Thermostats which contain a schedule MAY use this attribute to control how that schedule is used, even if they do not support the ScheduleConfiguration feature.
>
> When ScheduleActive is not set, the setpoint is altered only by manual up/down changes at the ther­ mostat or remotely, not by internal schedule programming.
>
> **NOTE** Modifying the ScheduleActive bit does not clear or delete previous weekly schedule programming configurations.

> The null value indicates the attribute is unused.
>
> If the Thermostat client attempts to write [OccupiedSetback](#occupiedsetback-attribute) to a value greater than [OccupiedSet­](#occupiedsetbackmax-attribute) [backMax](#occupiedsetbackmax-attribute), the Thermostat server SHALL set its [OccupiedSetback](#occupiedsetback-attribute) value to [OccupiedSetbackMax](#occupiedsetbackmax-attribute) and SHALL send a Write Attribute Response command with a Status Code field enumeration of SUCCESS response.
>
> If the Thermostat client attempts to write [OccupiedSetback](#occupiedsetback-attribute) to a value less than [OccupiedSetback­](#occupiedsetbackmin-attribute) [Min](#occupiedsetbackmin-attribute), the Thermostat server SHALL set its [OccupiedSetback](#occupiedsetback-attribute) value to [OccupiedSetbackMin](#occupiedsetbackmin-attribute) and SHALL send a Write Attribute Response command with a Status Code field enumeration of SUCCESS response.

| 1 | **Amount** | int8 | all |  |  | M |

1.  **Mode Field**

> The field SHALL specify which setpoints are to be adjusted.

##### Heat Value

> If the server does not support the HEAT feature then it SHALL respond with INVALID_COMMAND. If the server supports the AUTO feature and the resulting setpoint would be invalid solely due to [Min­](#minsetpointdeadband-attribute) [SetpointDeadBand](#minsetpointdeadband-attribute) then the Cooling setpoint SHALL be increased sufficiently to maintain the dead­
>
> band.

##### Cool Value

> If the server does not support the COOL feature then it SHALL respond with INVALID_COMMAND. If the server supports the AUTO feature and the resulting setpoint would be invalid solely due to [MinSetpointDeadBand](#minsetpointdeadband-attribute) then the Heating setpoint SHALL be decreased sufficiently to maintain the deadband.

##### Both Value

> The client MAY indicate Both regardless of the server feature support. The server SHALL only adjust the setpoint that it supports and not respond with an error.

2.  **Amount Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the amount (possibly negative) that should be added to the setpoint(s), in steps of 0.1°C.

3.  **Effect on Receipt**

> Upon receipt, the attributes for the indicated setpoint(s) SHALL have the amount specified in the Amount field added to them. If the resulting value is outside the limits imposed by [MinCoolSet­](#mincoolsetpointlimit-attribute) [pointLimit](#mincoolsetpointlimit-attribute), [MaxCoolSetpointLimit](#maxcoolsetpointlimit-attribute), [MinHeatSetpointLimit](#minheatsetpointlimit-attribute) and [MaxHeatSetpointLimit](#maxheatsetpointlimit-attribute), the value is clamped to those limits. This is not considered an error condition.

##### SetWeeklySchedule Command

> This command is used to update the thermostat weekly setpoint schedule from a management sys­ tem. If the thermostat already has a weekly setpoint schedule programmed, then it SHOULD replace each daily setpoint set as it receives the updates from the management system. For example, if the thermostat has 4 setpoints for every day of the week and is sent a SetWeeklySchedule command with one setpoint for Saturday then the thermostat SHOULD remove all 4 setpoints for Saturday and replace those with the updated setpoint but leave all other days unchanged. If the schedule is larger than what fits in one frame or contains more than 10 transitions, the schedule SHALL then be sent using multiple SetWeeklySchedule Commands.

1.  **NumberOfTransitionsForSequence Field**

> This field SHALL indicate how many individual transitions to expect for this sequence of com­ mands. If a device supports more than 10 transitions in its schedule they can send this by sending more than 1 “Set Weekly Schedule” command, each containing the separate information that the device needs to set.

2.  **DayOfWeekForSequence Field**

> This field SHALL represent the day of the week at which all the transitions within the payload of the command SHOULD be associated to. This field is a bitmap and therefore the associated setpoint could overlap onto multiple days (you could set one transition time for all “week days” or whatever combination of days the implementation requests).
>
> Each setpoint transition will begin with the day of week for this transition. There can be up to 10 transitions for each command.

3.  **ModeForSequence Field**

> This field SHALL indicate how the application decodes the setpoint fields of each transition in the Transitions list.
>
> If the HeatSetpointPresent bit is On, the HeatSetpoint field SHALL NOT be null in **every** entry of the Transitions list.
>
> If the HeatSetpointPresent bit is Off, the HeatSetpoint field SHALL be null in **every** entry of the Transitions list.
>
> If the CoolSetpointPresent bit is On, the CoolSetpoint field SHALL NOT be null in **every** entry of the Transitions list.
>
> If the CoolSetpointPresent bit is Off, the CoolSetpoint field SHALL be null in **every** entry of the Tran­ sitions list.
>
> At least one of the bits in the Mode For Sequence byte SHALL be on.
>
> Both bits must be respected, even if the HEAT or COOL feature is not supported, to ensure the com­ mand is decoded and handled correctly.

4.  **Transitions Field**

> This field SHALL contain the list of setpoint transitions used to update the specified daily schedules

5.  **Effect on Receipt**

> Upon receipt, the weekly schedule for updating setpoints SHALL be stored in the thermostat and SHOULD begin at the time of receipt. A status code SHALL be sent in response.
>
> When a command is received that requires a total number of transitions greater than the device supports, the status of the response SHALL be INSUFFICIENT_SPACE.
>
> When any of the setpoints sent in the sequence is out of range (AbsMin/MaxSetPointLimit), or when the Mode for Sequence field includes a mode not supported by the device, the status of the response SHALL be CONSTRAINT_ERROR and no setpoints from the entire sequence SHOULD be used.
>
> When an overlapping transition is detected, the status of the response SHALL be FAILURE.
>
> When a device which does not support multiple days in a command receives a command with more than one bit set in the DayOfWeekForSequence field, or when a device which does not support mul­ tiple modes in a command receives a command with more than one bit set in the ModeForSequence field, or when the contents of the Transitions field does not agree with NumberOfTransitionsForSe­ quence, DayOfWeekForSequence or ModeForSequence, the status of the response SHALL be INVALID_COMMAND.
>
> When the transitions could be added successfully, the status of the response SHALL be SUCCESS.

2.  **ModeToReturn Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the mode the client would like to return the set point values for and could be any combination of heat only, cool only or heat & cool.

3.  **Effect on Receipt**

> Upon receipt, the unit SHOULD send in return the Get Weekly Schedule Response command. The Days to Return and Mode to Return fields are defined as bitmask for the flexibility to support multi­ ple days and multiple modes within one command. If thermostat cannot handle incoming com­ mand with multiple days and/or multiple modes within one command, it SHALL send default response of INVALID_COMMAND in return.

##### ClearWeeklySchedule Command

> This command is used to clear the weekly schedule. The Clear weekly schedule has no payload.
>
> Upon receipt, all transitions currently stored SHALL be cleared and a default response of SUCCESS SHALL be sent in response. There are no error responses to this command.

##### GetRelayStatusLog Command

> This command is used to query the thermostat internal relay status log. This command has no pay­ load.
>
> Upon receipt, the unit SHALL respond with Relay Status Log command if the relay status log feature is supported on the unit.
>
> The log storing order is First in First Out (FIFO) when the log is generated and stored into the Queue.
>
> The first record in the log (i.e., the oldest) one, is the first to be replaced when there is a new record and there is no more space in the log. Thus, the newest record will overwrite the oldest one if there is no space left.
>
> The log storing order is Last In First Out (LIFO) when the log is being retrieved from the Queue by a client device.
>
> Once the "Get Relay Status Log Response" frame is sent by the Server, the "Unread Entries" attribute SHOULD be decremented to indicate the number of unread records that remain in the queue.
>
> If the "Unread Entries" attribute reaches zero and the Client sends a new "Get Relay Status Log
>
> Request", the Server MAY send one of the following items as a response:

1.  Resend the last Get Relay Status Log Response or

2.  Generate new log record at the time of request and send Get Relay Status Log Response with the new data

> For both cases, the "Unread Entries" attribute will remain zero.

##### GetRelayStatusLogResponse Command

> This command is sent from the thermostat cluster server in response to the Get Relay Status Log. After the Relay Status Entry is sent over the air to the requesting client, the specific entry will be cleared from the thermostat internal log.

##### MultiSpeed Feature

> Legacy Fan Control cluster revision 0-1 defined 3 speeds (low, medium and high) plus automatic speed control but left it up to the implementer to decide what was supported. Therefore, it is assumed that legacy client implementations are capable of determining, from the server, the num­ ber of speeds supported between 1, 2, or 3, and whether automatic speed control is supported.
>
> The [MultiSpeed](#multispeed-feature) feature includes new attributes that support a running fan speed value from 0 to SpeedMax, which has a maximum of 100.

##### FanMode Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the current speed mode of the fan. This attribute MAY be written by the client to request a different fan mode. A server SHALL return INVALID_IN_STATE to indicate that the fan is not in a state where the FanMode can be changed to the requested value. A server MAY have FanMode values that it can never be set to. For example, where this cluster appears on the same or another endpoint as other clusters with a system dependency, for example the Thermo­ stat cluster, attempting to set the FanMode attribute of this cluster to Off may not be allowed by the system.
>
> This attribute SHALL be set to one of the values in [FanModeEnum](#_bookmark606).
>
> When the FanMode attribute is successfully written to, the [PercentSetting](#percentsetting-attribute) and [SpeedSetting](#speedsetting-attribute) (if present) attributes SHALL be set to appropriate values, as defined by the [Section 4.4.6.3.1](#_bookmark610) and [Sec­](#_bookmark613) [tion 4.4.6.6.1](#_bookmark613) respectively, unless otherwise specified below.
>
> When the FanMode attribute is set to any given mode, the [PercentCurrent](#percentcurrent-attribute) and [SpeedCurrent](#speedcurrent-attribute) (if present) SHALL indicate the actual currently operating fan speed, unless otherwise specified below.

1.  **Off Value**

> Setting the attribute value to Off SHALL set the values of these attributes to 0 (zero):

- [PercentSetting](#percentsetting-attribute)

- [PercentCurrent](#percentcurrent-attribute)

- [SpeedSetting](#speedsetting-attribute) (if present)

- [SpeedCurrent](#speedcurrent-attribute) (if present)

2.  **Auto Value**

> Setting the attribute value to Auto SHALL set the values of these attributes to null:

- [PercentSetting](#percentsetting-attribute)

- [SpeedSetting](#speedsetting-attribute) (if present)

> These attributes SHALL continue to indicate the current state of the fan while this attribute value is Auto:

- [PercentCurrent](#percentcurrent-attribute)

- [SpeedCurrent](#speedcurrent-attribute) (if present)

3.  **On Value**

> If a client attempts to write a value of On, the attribute SHALL be set to High.

4.  **Smart Value**

> If a client attempts to write a value of Smart and the AUT feature is supported, the attribute SHALL be set to Auto, otherwise the attribute SHALL be set to High.

##### FanModeSequence Attribute

> This attribute indicates the fan speed ranges that SHALL be supported.

##### PercentSetting Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the speed setting for the fan. This attribute MAY be written by the client to indicate a new fan speed. If the client writes null to this attribute, the attribute value SHALL NOT change. A server SHALL return INVALID_IN_STATE to indicate that the fan is not in a state where the [PercentSetting](#percentsetting-attribute) can be changed to the requested value.
>
> If this is successfully written to 0, the server SHALL set the FanMode attribute value to Off.

5.  **Percent Rules**

> It is up to the server implementation to map between ranges of the [PercentSetting](#percentsetting-attribute) attribute and FanMode attribute enumerated values. Percent values are split into ranges, each range correspond­ ing to a supported FanMode attribute value. Percent ranges SHALL NOT overlap. All percent values in the High speed range SHALL be higher than all percent values in the Medium and Low speed ranges, if supported. All percent values in the Medium speed range SHALL be higher than all per­ cent values in the Low speed range. If the client sets the FanMode attribute to Low, Medium or High, the server SHALL set the [PercentSetting](#percentsetting-attribute) attribute to a value within the corresponding range. If the client sets the [PercentSetting](#percentsetting-attribute) attribute, the server SHALL set the FanMode attribute to Low, Medium or High, based on the percent value being in the corresponding range.
>
> If the [MultiSpeed](#multispeed-feature) feature is supported, the calculation of [SpeedSetting](#speedsetting-attribute) or [SpeedCurrent](#speedcurrent-attribute) (speed) from a percent value change for PercentSetting or PercentCurrent respectively (percent) SHALL hold true:

- speed = ceil( SpeedMax \* (percent \* 0.01) )

##### PercentCurrent Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the actual currently operating fan speed, or zero to indicate that the fan is off. There MAY be a temporary mismatch between the value of this attribute and the value of the [PercentSetting](#percentsetting-attribute) attribute due to other system requirements that would not allow the fan to oper­ ate at the requested setting. See [Section 4.4.6.3.1](#_bookmark610) for more details.

##### SpeedMax Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate that the fan has one speed (value of 1) or the maximum speed, if the fan is capable of multiple speeds.

##### SpeedSetting Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the speed setting for the fan. This attribute MAY be written by the client to indicate a new fan speed. If the client writes null to this attribute, the attribute value SHALL NOT change. A server SHALL return INVALID_IN_STATE to indicate that the fan is not in a state where the SpeedSetting can be changed to the requested value.
>
> If this is successfully written to 0, the server SHALL set the FanMode attribute value to Off. Please see the [Section 4.4.6.6.1](#_bookmark613) for details on other values.

1.  **Speed Rules**

> It is up to the server implementation to map between ranges of the [SpeedSetting](#speedsetting-attribute) attribute and Fan­ Mode attribute enumerated values. Speed values are split into ranges, each range corresponding to a FanMode attribute value. Speed ranges SHALL NOT overlap. All speed values in the High speed range SHALL be higher than all speed values in the Medium and Low speed ranges, if supported. All speed values in the Medium speed range SHALL be higher than all speed values in the Low speed range. If the client sets the FanMode attribute to Low, Medium or High, the server SHALL set the [SpeedSetting](#speedsetting-attribute) attribute to a value within the corresponding range. If the client sets the [SpeedSet­](#speedsetting-attribute) [ting](#speedsetting-attribute) attribute, the server SHALL set the FanMode attribute to Low, Medium or High, based on the speed value being in the corresponding range.
>
> This calculation for the value of [PercentSetting](#percentsetting-attribute) or [PercentCurrent](#percentcurrent-attribute) (percent) from a speed value change for SpeedSetting or SpeedCurrent respectively (speed) SHALL hold true:

- percent = floor( speed/SpeedMax \* 100 )

##### SpeedCurrent Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the actual currently operating fan speed, or zero to indicate that the fan is off. There MAY be a temporary mismatch between the value of this attribute and the value of the [SpeedSetting](#speedsetting-attribute) attribute due to other system requirements that would not allow the fan to oper­ ate at the requested setting.

##### RockSupport Attribute

> This attribute is a bitmap that indicates what rocking motions the server supports.

##### RockSetting Attribute

> This attribute is a bitmap that indicates the current active fan rocking motion settings. Each bit SHALL only be set to 1, if the corresponding bit in the RockSupport attribute is set to 1, otherwise a status code of CONSTRAINT_ERROR SHALL be returned.
>
> If a combination of supported bits is set by the client, and the server does not support the combina­ tion, the lowest supported single bit in the combination SHALL be set and active, and all other bits SHALL indicate zero.

##### WindSupport Attribute

> This attribute is a bitmap that indicates what wind modes the server supports. At least one wind mode bit SHALL be set.

##### WindSetting Attribute

> This attribute is a bitmap that indicates the current active fan wind feature settings. Each bit SHALL only be set to 1, if the corresponding bit in the WindSupport attribute is set to 1, otherwise a status code of CONSTRAINT_ERROR SHALL be returned.
>
> If a combination of supported bits is set by the client, and the server does not support the combina­ tion, the lowest supported single bit in the combination SHALL be set and active, and all other bits SHALL indicate zero.

##### AirflowDirection Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the current airflow direction of the fan. This attribute MAY be writ­ ten by the client to indicate a new airflow direction for the fan. This attribute SHALL be set to one of the values in the [AirflowDirectionEnum](#_bookmark605) table.

> The client sends this command to speed the fan up or down in a step by step fashion.

5.  **Effect Upon Receipt**

    - This command SHALL be executed even if the fan speed is not currently at an implemented step value.

    - If the Direction field is Increase,

      - If the fan speed is lower than the highest step value, the fan speed SHALL change to the low­ est step value that is higher than the current fan speed.

      - Else if Wrap is TRUE, the fan speed SHALL change to the lowest step value.

      - Else the fan speed SHALL change to (or remain at) the highest step value.

- If the Direction field is Decrease,

  - If the fan speed is higher than the lowest step value, the fan speed SHALL change to the highest step value that is lower than the current fan speed.

  - Else if Wrap is TRUE, the fan speed SHALL change to the highest step value.

  - Else the fan speed SHALL change to (or remain at) the lowest step value.

- Although the effect of the Step command is implementation specific, the effect on receipt of the Step command SHALL adhere to the conformance of the affected attributes.

##### OpenDuration Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the total duration, in seconds, for which the valve will remain open for this current opening.
>
> A value of null SHALL indicate the duration is not set, meaning that the valve will remain open until closed by the user or some other automation.

##### DefaultOpenDuration Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the default duration, in seconds, for which the valve will remain open, if the OpenDuration field is not present in the [Open](#open-command) command.
>
> A value of null SHALL indicate the duration is not set, meaning that the valve will remain open until closed by the user or some other automation.

##### AutoCloseTime Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the UTC time when the valve will close, depending on value of the [OpenDuration](#openduration-attribute) attribute.
>
> This attribute SHALL be null:

- When [OpenDuration](#openduration-attribute) is null, or

- When the valve does not have a synchronized UTCTime in the Time Synchronization cluster, or

- When the valve is closed.

> When the value of this attribute is earlier or equal to the current UTC time, the valve SHALL auto­ matically transition to its closed position. The behavior of transitioning to the closed position, SHALL match the behavior described in the [Close](#close-command) command.
>
> If this attribute is not null and the Time Synchronization cluster receives a SetUTCTime command, modifying the current UTC time of the device, the value of this attribute SHALL be adjusted to match the new UTC time plus the value of the [RemainingDuration](#remainingduration-attribute) attribute.

##### RemainingDuration Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the remaining duration, in seconds, until the valve closes. This attribute SHALL be null:

- When [OpenDuration](#openduration-attribute) is null, or

- When the valve is closed.

> The value of this attribute SHALL only be reported in the following cases:

- When it changes from null to any other value and vice versa, or

- When it changes to 0, or

- When it increases, or

- When the closing time changes.

> Meaning that clients SHOULD NOT rely on the reporting of this attribute in order to keep track of the remaining duration, due to this attribute not being reported during regular countdown.
>
> When reading this attribute it SHALL return the remaining duration, in seconds, until the valve closes.
>
> When the value of this attribute counts down to 0, the valve SHALL automatically transition to its closed position. The behavior of transitioning to the closed position SHALL match the behavior described in the [Close](#close-command) command.

##### CurrentState Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the current state of the valve.
>
> A value of null SHALL indicate that the current state is not known.

##### TargetState Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the target state, while changing the state, of the valve.
>
> A value of null SHALL indicate that no target position is set, since the change in state is either done or failed.

##### CurrentLevel Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the current level of the valve as a percentage value, between fully closed and fully open. During a transition from one level to another level, the valve SHOULD keep this attribute updated to the best of its ability, in order to represent the actual level of the valve dur­ ing the movement.
>
> A value of 100 percent SHALL indicate the fully open position. A value of 0 percent SHALL indicate the fully closed position.
>
> A value of null SHALL indicate that the current state is not known.

##### TargetLevel Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the target level of the valve as a percentage value, between fully closed and fully open.
>
> The interpretation of the percentage value is the same as for the [CurrentLevel](#currentlevel-attribute-1) attribute.
>
> A value of null SHALL indicate that no target position is set, since the change of level is either done or failed.

##### DefaultOpenLevel Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the default value used for the [TargetLevel](#targetlevel-attribute) attribute, when a valve transitions from the closed to the open state, caused by an [Open](#open-command) command, if a TargetLevel field is not present in the [Open](#open-command) command.

##### Open Command

> This command is used to set the valve to its open position.

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **OpenDura­ tion** | elapsed-s | min 1 | X |  | O |
| 1 | **TargetLevel** | percent | min 1 |  |  | \[LVL\] |

1.  **OpenDuration Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the duration that the valve will remain open for this specific Open com­ mand.
>
> A value of null SHALL indicate the duration is not set, meaning that the valve will remain open until closed by the user or some other automation.

2.  **TargetLevel Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the target level used for this specific Open command.

3.  **Effect on Receipt**

> If the device has registered a fault, that prevents it from performing the requested action, the com­ mand SHALL be ignored and a FailureDueToFault status SHALL be returned.
>
> The device SHALL set the [TargetState](#targetstate-attribute) attribute to the Open value and set the [CurrentState](#currentstate-attribute) attribute to the Transitioning value.
>
> If the OpenDuration field is present, the value of the [OpenDuration](#openduration-attribute) attribute SHALL be set to the value of the OpenDuration field.
>
> If the OpenDuration field is not present, the value of [OpenDuration](#openduration-attribute) attribute SHALL be set to the value of the [DefaultOpenDuration](#defaultopenduration-attribute) attribute.
>
> If the [OpenDuration](#openduration-attribute) attribute is null, it SHALL indicate that there is no auto close defined for the current Open action and the device SHALL set the [RemainingDuration](#remainingduration-attribute) attribute to null. If the
>
> device supports the TimeSync feature, the device SHALL set the [AutoCloseTime](#autoclosetime-attribute) attribute to null.
>
> If the [OpenDuration](#openduration-attribute) attribute is not null, it indicates that an auto close duration is defined for the current open action and the device SHALL set the value of the [RemainingDuration](#remainingduration-attribute) attribute equal to the value of the [OpenDuration](#openduration-attribute) attribute. If the device supports the TimeSync feature, the device SHALL set the [AutoCloseTime](#autoclosetime-attribute) attribute to the UTC value of the time when command was received plus the value of the [OpenDuration](#openduration-attribute) attribute.
>
> If the [LevelStep](#levelstep-attribute) attribute and the TargetLevel field are both present and the value of the Tar­ getLevel field is not 100, the value of the TargetLevel field SHALL be a supported value as defined by the [LevelStep](#levelstep-attribute) attribute, such that (Value of TargetLevel field) % (Value of [LevelStep](#levelstep-attribute) attribute) equals 0. If the resulting value is not 0, the requested TargetLevel value is considered an unsup­ ported value and a CONSTRAINT_ERROR status SHALL be returned.
>
> If the device supports the Level feature, the [TargetLevel](#targetlevel-attribute) attribute SHALL be set to the value of the TargetLevel field, if present. If the TargetLevel field is not present, the [TargetLevel](#targetlevel-attribute) attribute SHALL be set to the value of the [DefaultOpenLevel](#defaultopenlevel-attribute) attribute, if implemented. If the [DefaultOpenLevel](#defaultopenlevel-attribute) attribute is not present, the [TargetLevel](#targetlevel-attribute) attribute SHALL be set to 100.
>
> When the relevant target and duration attributes have been set, the device SHALL start the move­ ment towards the target value and start the countdown of the [RemainingDuration](#remainingduration-attribute) attribute. If the device supports the Level feature, the device SHALL update the [CurrentLevel](#currentlevel-attribute-1) attribute at the start of the movement, and SHOULD update it as appropriate during movement, especially if it is slow. When the movement is complete, the device SHALL set the [CurrentState](#currentstate-attribute) attribute to the Open value.

### Features

> This cluster SHALL support the FeatureMap bitmap attribute as defined below.

| **Bit** | **Code** | **Feature** | **Conformance** | **Summary** |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **PIN** | PINCredential | O | Lock supports PIN credentials (via keypad, or over- the-air) |
| 1 | **RID** | RFIDCredential | O | Lock supports RFID credentials |
| 2 | **FGP** | FingerCredentials | P, O | Lock supports fin­ ger related cre­ dentials (finger­ print, finger vein) |

[TABLE]

##### PINCredential Feature

> If the User Feature is also supported then any PIN Code stored in the lock SHALL be associated with a User.
>
> A lock MAY support multiple credential types so if the User feature is supported the UserType, User­ Status and Schedules are all associated with a User index and not directly with a PIN index. A User index may have several credentials associated with it.

##### RFIDCredential Feature

> If the User Feature is also supported then any RFID credential stored in the lock SHALL be associ­ ated with a User.
>
> A lock MAY support multiple credential types so if the User feature is supported the UserType, User­ Status and Schedules are all associated with a User index and not directly with a RFID index. A User Index may have several credentials associated with it.

##### FingerCredentials Feature

> Currently the cluster only defines the metadata format for notifications when a fingerprint/ finger vein credential is used to access the lock and doesn’t describe how to create fingerprint/finger vein credentials. If the Users feature is also supported then the User that a fingerprint/finger vein is associated with can also have its UserType, UserStatus and Schedule modified.
>
> A lock MAY support multiple credential types so if the User feature is supported the UserType, User­ Status and Schedules are all associated with a User index and not directly with a Finger index. A User Index may have several credentials associated with it.

##### WeekDayAccessSchedules Feature

> If the User feature is supported then Week Day Schedules are applied to a User and not a credential.
>
> Week Day Schedules are used to restrict access to a specified time window on certain days of the week. The schedule is repeated each week.
>
> The lock MAY automatically adjust the UserType when a schedule is created or cleared.
>
> Support for WeekDayAccessSchedules requires that the lock has the capability of keeping track of local time.

##### DoorPositionSensor Feature

> If this feature is supported this indicates that the lock has the ability to determine the position of the door which is separate from the state of the lock.

##### FaceCredentials Feature

> Currently the cluster only defines the metadata format for notifications when a face recognition, iris, or retina credential is used to access the lock and doesn’t describe how to create face recogni­ tion, iris, or retina credentials. If the Users feature is also supported then the User that a face recog­ nition, iris, or retina credential is associated with can also have its UserType, UserStatus and Sched­ ule modified.
>
> A lock MAY support multiple credential types so if the User feature is supported the UserType, User­ Status and Schedules are all associated with a User and not directly with a credential.

##### CredentialOverTheAirAccess Feature

> If this feature is supported then the lock supports the ability to verify a credential provided in a
>
> lock/unlock command. Currently the cluster only supports providing the PIN credential to the lock/unlock commands. If this feature is supported then the PIN Credential feature SHALL also be supported.

##### User Feature

> If the User Feature is supported then a lock employs a User database. A User within the User data­ base is used to associate credentials and schedules to single user record within the lock. This also means the UserType and UserStatus fields are associated with a User and not a credential.

##### YearDayAccessSchedules Feature

> If the User feature is supported then Year Day Schedules are applied to a User and not a credential. Year Day Schedules are used to restrict access to a specified date and time window.
>
> The lock MAY automatically adjust the UserType when a schedule is created or cleared.
>
> Support for YearDayAccessSchedules requires that the lock has the capability of keeping track of local time.

##### HolidaySchedules Feature

> This feature is used to setup Holiday Schedule in the lock device. A Holiday Schedule sets a start and stop end date/time for the lock to use the specified operating mode set by the Holiday Schedule.
>
> Support for HolidaySchedules requires that the lock has the capability of keeping track of local time.

##### Unbolting Feature

> Locks that support this feature differentiate between unbolting and unlocking. The Unbolt Door command retracts the bolt without pulling the latch. The Unlock Door command fully unlocks the door by retracting the bolt and briefly pulling the latch. While the latch is pulled, the lock state changes to Unlatched. Locks without unbolting support don’t differentiate between unbolting and unlocking and perform the same operation for both commands.

##### AliroProvisioning Feature

> Locks that support this feature implement the Aliro specification as defined in [\[Aliro\]](#_bookmark6) and support Matter as a method for provisioning Aliro credentials.

##### AliroBLEUWB Feature

> Locks that support this feature implement the Bluetooth LE + UWB Access Control Flow as defined in [\[Aliro\]](#_bookmark6).

### Recommended steps for creating a new User

> It is RECOMMENDED that the Administrator query the door lock for what users already exist in its database to find an available UserIndex for creating a new User (see [GetUser](#getuser-command) command).

1.  Use [SetUser](#setuser-command) command with an available UserIndex to set the user record fields as applicable.

2.  Use [SetCredential](#setcredential-command) command with same UserIndex to add one or more credentials as applicable.

3.  Use [SetWeekDaySchedule](#setweekdayschedule-command) command or [SetYearDaySchedule](#setyeardayschedule-command) command with same UserIndex to add one or more schedule restrictions as applicable.

> For example, if the device supports only PIN and RFID credential types, NumberOfCredentialsSup­ portedPerUser is set to 10, NumberOfPINUsersSupported is set to 5 and NumberOfRFIDUsersSup­ ported is set to 3, it will not be possible to actually assign 10 credentials for a user because maxi­ mum number of credentials in the database is 8.

##### Language Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the language for the on-screen or audible user interface using a 2- byte language code from ISO-639-1.

##### LEDSettings Attribute

##### DefaultConfigurationRegister Attribute

> This attribute SHALL represent the default configurations as they are physically set on the device (example: hardware dip switch setting, etc…) and represents the default setting for some of the
>
> attributes within this cluster (for example: LED, Auto Lock, Sound Volume, and Operating Mode attributes).
>
> This is a read-only attribute and is intended to allow clients to determine what changes MAY need to be made without having to query all the included attributes. It MAY be beneficial for the clients to know what the device’s original settings were in the event that the device needs to be restored to factory default settings.
>
> If the Client device would like to query and modify the door lock server’s operating settings, it SHOULD send read and write attribute requests to the specific attributes.
>
> For example, the Sound Volume attribute default value is Silent Mode. However, it is possible that the current Sound Volume is High Volume. Therefore, if the client wants to query/modify the cur­ rent Sound Volume setting on the server, the client SHOULD read/write to the Sound Volume attribute.

1.  **LocalProgramming Bit**

> This bit SHALL indicate the default value of the EnableLocalProgramming attribute.

2.  **KeypadInterface Bit**

> This bit SHALL indicate the default state of the keypad interface.

3.  **RemoteInterface Bit**

> This bit SHALL indicate the default state of the remote interface.

> This bit SHALL indicate the default value of LEDSettings attribute.

##### EnableLocalProgramming Attribute

> This attribute SHALL enable/disable local programming on the door lock of certain features (see LocalProgrammingFeatures attribute). If this value is set to TRUE then local programming is enabled on the door lock for all features. If it is set to FALSE then local programming is disabled on the door lock for those features whose bit is set to 0 in the LocalProgrammingFeatures attribute. Local programming SHALL be enabled by default.

##### EnableOneTouchLocking Attribute

> This attribute SHALL enable/disable the ability to lock the door lock with a single touch on the door lock.

##### EnableInsideStatusLED Attribute

> This attribute SHALL enable/disable an inside LED that allows the user to see at a glance if the door is locked.

##### EnablePrivacyModeButton Attribute

> This attribute SHALL enable/disable a button inside the door that is used to put the lock into pri­ vacy mode. When the lock is in privacy mode it cannot be manipulated from the outside.

##### LocalProgrammingFeatures Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the local programming features that will be disabled when EnableLo­ calProgramming attribute is set to False. If a door lock doesn’t support disabling one aspect of local programming it SHALL return CONSTRAINT_ERROR during a write operation of this attribute. If the EnableLocalProgramming attribute is set to True then all local programming features SHALL be enabled regardless of the bits set to 0 in this attribute.
>
> The features that can be disabled from local programming are defined in [LocalProgrammingFea­](#localprogrammingfeaturesbitmap-type) [turesBitmap](#localprogrammingfeaturesbitmap-type).

##### WrongCodeEntryLimit Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the number of incorrect Pin codes or RFID presentment attempts a user is allowed to enter before the lock will enter a lockout state. The value of this attribute is com­ pared to all failing forms of credential presentation, including Pin codes used in an Unlock Com­ mand when RequirePINforRemoteOperation is set to true. Valid range is 1-255 incorrect attempts. The lockout state will be for the duration of UserCodeTemporaryDisableTime. If the attribute accepts writes and an attempt to write the value 0 is made, the device SHALL respond with CON­ STRAINT_ERROR.
>
> The lock MAY reset the counter used to track incorrect credential presentations as required by internal logic, environmental events, or other reasons. The lock SHALL reset the counter if a valid credential is presented.

##### UserCodeTemporaryDisableTime Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the number of seconds that the lock shuts down following wrong code entry. Valid range is 1-255 seconds. Device can shut down to lock user out for specified amount of time. (Makes it difficult to try and guess a PIN for the device.) If the attribute accepts writes and an attempt to write the attribute to 0 is made, the device SHALL respond with CONSTRAINT_ERROR.

##### SendPINOverTheAir Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the door locks ability to send PINs over the air. If the attribute is True it is ok for the door lock server to send PINs over the air. This attribute determines the behavior of the server’s TX operation. If it is false, then it is not ok for the device to send PIN in any messages over the air.
>
> The PIN field within any door lock cluster message SHALL keep the first octet unchanged and
>
> masks the actual code by replacing with 0xFF. For example (PIN "1234" ): If the attribute value is True, 0x04 0x31 0x32 0x33 0x34 SHALL be used in the PIN field in any door lock cluster message payload. If the attribute value is False, 0x04 0xFF 0xFF 0xFF 0xFF SHALL be used.

##### RequirePINForRemoteOperation Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate if the door lock requires an optional PIN. If this attribute is set to True, the door lock server requires that an optional PINs be included in the payload of remote lock operation events like Lock, Unlock, Unlock with Timeout and Toggle in order to function.

##### ExpiringUserTimeout Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the number of minutes a PIN, RFID, Fingerprint, or other credential associated with a user of type ExpiringUser SHALL remain valid after its first use before expiring. When the credential expires the UserStatus for the corresponding user record SHALL be set to OccupiedDisabled.

##### AlarmMask Attribute

> This attribute is only supported if the Alarms cluster is on the same endpoint. The alarm mask is used to turn on/off alarms for particular functions. Alarms for an alarm group are enabled if the associated alarm mask bit is set. Each bit represents a group of alarms. Entire alarm groups can be turned on or off by setting or clearing the associated bit in the alarm mask.
>
> This mask DOES NOT apply to the Events mechanism of this cluster.

- SUCCESS, if setting user credential was successful.

- FAILURE, if some unexpected internal error occurred setting user credential.

- OCCUPIED, if OperationType is Add and CredentialIndex in Credential structure points to an occupied slot.

- OCCUPIED, if OperationType is Modify and CredentialIndex in Credential structure does not match the CredentialIndex that is already associated with the provided UserIndex.

- DUPLICATE, if CredentialData provided is a duplicate of another credential with the same Cre­ dentialType (e.g. duplicate PIN code).

- RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED, if OperationType is Add and the new credential cannot be added due to resource constraints such as:

  - The user referred to by UserIndex already has NumberOfCredentialsSupportedPerUser cre­ dentials associated.

  - The credential is of type [AliroEvictableEndpointKey](#_bookmark673) or [AliroNonEvictableEndpointKey](#_bookmark674), and adding it would cause the total number of credentials of those two types to exceed [Num­](#numberofaliroendpointkeyssupported) [berOfAliroEndpointKeysSupported](#numberofaliroendpointkeyssupported).

&nbsp;

- INVALID_COMMAND, if one or more fields violate constraints or are invalid.

- INVALID_COMMAND, if the CredentialIndex in the Credential provided exceeds the number of credentials of the provided CredentialType supported by the lock.

##### Tilt Feature

> The Tilt feature applies to window coverings with vertical or horizontal strips.

##### PositionAware Features

> Relative positioning with *percent100ths* (min step 0.01%) attribute is mandatory, e.g. Max 10000 equals 100.00% and relative positioning with *percent* (min step 1%) attribute is for backward com­ patibility.
>
> The *CurrentPosition* attributes SHALL always reflects the physical position of an actuator and the *TargetPosition* attribute SHALL reflect the requested position of an actuator once a positioning command is received.

1.  **PositionAwareLift Feature**

> Relative positioning for lift attributes and commands.

##### InstalledOpenLimitLift Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the open limit for lifting the window covering whether position (in centimeters) is encoded or timed.

##### InstalledClosedLimitLift Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the closed limit for lifting the window covering whether position (in centimeters) is encoded or timed.

##### InstalledOpenLimitTilt Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the open limit for tilting the window covering whether position (in tenth of a degree) is encoded or timed.

##### InstalledClosedLimitTilt Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the closed limit for tilting the window covering whether position (in tenth of a degree) is encoded or timed.

##### Mode Attribute

> The Mode attribute allows configuration of the window covering, such as: reversing the motor direction, placing the window covering into calibration mode, placing the motor into maintenance mode, disabling the network, and disabling status LEDs.
>
> In the case a device does not support or implement a specific mode, e.g. the device has a specific installation method and reversal is not relevant or the device does not include a maintenance mode, any write interaction to the Mode attribute, with an unsupported mode bit or any out of bounds bits set, must be ignored and a response containing the status of CONSTRAINT_ERROR will be returned.

5.  **MotorDirectionReversed Bit**

> This bit SHALL control the [LiftMovementReversed](#_bookmark717) bit in the [ConfigStatus](#configstatus-attribute) attribute.

6.  **CalibrationMode Bit**

> If in calibration mode, all commands (e.g: UpOrOpen, DownOrClose, GoTos) that can result in move­ ment, could be accepted and result in a self-calibration being initiated before the command is exe­ cuted.
>
> In case the window covering does not have the ability or is not able to perform a self-calibration, the command SHOULD be ignored and a FAILURE status SHOULD be returned.
>
> In a write interaction, setting this bit to 0, while the device is in calibration mode, is not allowed and SHALL generate a FAILURE error status. In order to leave calibration mode, the device must perform its calibration routine, either as a self-calibration or assisted by external tool(s), depending on the device/manufacturer implementation.
>
> A manufacturer might choose to set the [Operational](#_bookmark716) bit of the [ConfigStatus](#configstatus-attribute) attribute to its not oper­ ational value, if applicable during calibration mode.

7.  **MaintenanceMode Bit**

> While in maintenance mode, all commands (e.g: UpOrOpen, DownOrClose, GoTos) or local inputs that can result in movement, must be ignored and respond with a BUSY status. Additionally, the [Operational](#_bookmark716) bit of the [ConfigStatus](#configstatus-attribute) attribute should be set to its not operational value.

##### SafetyStatus Attribute

> The SafetyStatus attribute reflects the state of the safety sensors and the common issues preventing movements. By default for nominal operation all flags are cleared (0). A device might support none, one or several bit flags from this attribute (all optional).

> *Table 11. Overview of the Media Clusters*

| **Cluster ID** | **Cluster Name** | **Description** |
|----|----|----|
| 0x050E | [Account Login](#account-login-cluster) | This cluster provides an inter­ face for facilitating user account login on an application or a node. |
| 0x050D | [Application Basic](#application-basic-cluster) | Provides information about a Content App running on a Video Player device which is repre­ sented as an endpoint. |
| 0x050C | [Application Launcher](#application-launcher-cluster) | This cluster provides an inter­ face for launching content on a Video Player device. |

| 0x0504 | [Channel](#channel-cluster) | This cluster provides an inter­ face for controlling the current Channel on an endpoint. |
| 0x0510 | [Content App Observer](#content-app-observer-cluster) | This cluster provides an inter­ face for sending targeted mes­ sages from a Content App to a Client of that Content App. |

| **Cluster ID** | **Cluster Name** | **Description** |
|----|----|----|
| 0x050A | [Content Launcher](#content-launcher-cluster) | This cluster provides an inter­ face for launching content on a Video Player device or a Con­ tent App. |

> *Example Usage of the Media Clusters*
>
> ![](media/image65.png)

## Account Login Cluster

> This cluster provides commands that facilitate user account login on a Content App or a node. For example, a Content App running on a Video Player device, which is represented as an endpoint (see Device Type Library document), can use this cluster to help make the user account on the Content App match the user account on the Client.
>
> Often a fabric administrator will facilitate commissioning of a Client (such as a Casting Video Client), and invoke commands on the AccountLogin cluster on the Content App associated with that client. Specifically:

1.  GetSetupPIN in order to attempt to obtain the Passcode for commissioning.

2.  Login in order to let the Content App know that commissioning has completed. The Content App can use information provided in this command in order to determine the user account associ­ ated with the client, and potentially assume that user account.

3.  Logout in order to let the Content App know that client access has been removed, and poten­ tially clear the current user account.

> The cluster server for this cluster may be supported on each endpoint that represents a Content App on a Video Player device.
>
> See Device Type Library document for details of how a Content App, represented as an endpoint on
>
> the Video Player device, may implement the cluster server for this cluster to simplify account login for its users.

> The purpose of this command is to determine if the active user account of the given Content App matches the active user account of a given Commissionee, and when it does, return a Setup PIN code which can be used for password-authenticated session establishment (PASE) with the Commis­ sionee.
>
> For example, a Video Player with a Content App Platform may invoke this command on one of its Content App endpoints to facilitate commissioning of a Phone App made by the same vendor as the Content App. If the accounts match, then the Content App may return a setup code that can be used
>
> by the Video Player to commission the Phone App without requiring the user to physically input a setup code.
>
> The account match is determined by the Content App using a method which is outside the scope of this specification and will typically involve a central service which is in communication with both the Content App and the Commissionee. The GetSetupPIN command is needed in order to provide the Commissioner/Admin with a Setup PIN when this Commissioner/Admin is operated by a differ­ ent vendor from the Content App.
>
> This method is used to facilitate Setup PIN exchange (for PASE) between Commissioner and Com­ missionee when the same user account is active on both nodes. With this method, the Content App satisfies proof of possession related to commissioning by requiring the same user account to be active on both Commissionee and Content App, while the Commissioner/Admin ensures user con­ sent by prompting the user prior to invocation of the command.
>
> Upon receipt of this command, the Content App checks if the account associated with the Tempo­ rary Account Identifier sent by the client is the same account that is active on itself. If the accounts are the same, then the Content App returns the GetSetupPIN Response which includes a Setup PIN that may be used for PASE with the Commissionee.
>
> The Temporary Account Identifier for a Commissionee may be populated with the Rotating ID field of the client’s commissionable node advertisement (see Rotating Device Identifier section in [\[Mat­](#_bookmark8) [terCore\]](#_bookmark8)) encoded as an octet string where the octets of the Rotating Device Identifier are encoded as 2-character sequences by representing each octet’s value as a 2-digit hexadecimal number, using uppercase letters.
>
> The Setup PIN is a character string so that it can accommodate different future formats, including alpha-numeric encodings. For a Commissionee it SHALL be populated with the Manual Pairing Code (see Manual Pairing Code section in [\[MatterCore\]](#_bookmark8)) encoded as a string (11 characters) or the Passcode portion of the Manual Pairing Code (when less than 11 characters) .
>
> The server SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks. No more than 10 unique requests in a 10 minute period SHALL be allowed; a command response status of FAILURE should sent for additional commands received within the 10 minute period. Because access to this com­ mand is limited to nodes with Admin-level access, and the user is prompted for consent prior to Commissioning, there are in place multiple obstacles to successfully mounting a brute force attack. A Content App that supports this command SHALL ensure that the Temporary Account Identifier used by its clients is not valid for more than 10 minutes.

>
> **NOTE** Newer cluster clients should be aware that AccountLogin cluster version 1 specified an 11 digit minimum length.

##### Login Command

> The purpose of this command is to allow the Content App to assume the user account of a given Commissionee by leveraging the Setup PIN code input by the user during the commissioning process.
>
> For example, a Video Player with a Content App Platform may invoke this command on one of its Content App endpoints after the commissioning has completed of a Phone App made by the same vendor as the Content App. The Content App may determine whether the Temporary Account Iden­ tifier maps to an account with a corresponding Setup PIN and, if so, it may automatically login to the account for the corresponding user. The end result is that a user performs commissioning of a Phone App to a Video Player by inputting the Setup PIN for the Phone App into the Video Player UX. Once commissioning has completed, the Video Player invokes this command to allow the corre­ sponding Content App to assume the same user account as the Phone App.
>
> The verification of Setup PIN for the given Temporary Account Identifier is determined by the Con­ tent App using a method which is outside the scope of this specification and will typically involve a central service which is in communication with both the Content App and the Commissionee. Implementations of such a service should impose aggressive time outs for any mapping of Tempo­ rary Account Identifier to Setup PIN in order to prevent accidental login due to delayed invocation.
>
> Upon receipt, the Content App checks if the account associated with the client’s Temp Account Iden­ tifier has a current active Setup PIN with the given value. If the Setup PIN is valid for the user account associated with the Temp Account Identifier, then the Content App MAY make that user account active.
>
> The Temporary Account Identifier for a Commissionee may be populated with the Rotating ID field of the client’s commissionable node advertisement encoded as an octet string where the octets of the Rotating Device Identifier are encoded as 2-character sequences by representing each octet’s value as a 2-digit hexadecimal number, using uppercase letters.
>
> The Setup PIN for a Commissionee may be populated with the Manual Pairing Code encoded as a string of decimal numbers (11 characters) or the Passcode portion of the Manual Pairing Code encoded as a string of decimal numbers (8 characters) .
>
> The server SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks. No more than 10 unique requests in a 10 minute period SHALL be allowed; a command response status of FAILURE should sent for additional commands received within the 10 minute period. Because access to this com­ mand is limited to nodes with Admin-level access, and the user is involved when obtaining the SetupPIN, there are in place multiple obstacles to successfully mounting a brute force attack. A Con­ tent App that supports this command SHALL ensure that the Temporary Account Identifier used by its clients is not valid for more than 10 minutes.

## 6.6. Channel Cluster

> This cluster provides an interface for controlling the current Channel on a device or endpoint.
>
> This cluster server would be supported on Video Player devices or endpoints that allow Channel control such as a Content App. This cluster provides a list of available channels and provides com­ mands for absolute and relative channel changes. Some of these commands and/or their responses MAY be large (see Large Message Quality under Data Model section in [\[MatterCore\]](#_bookmark8)), but they do not have the Large quality indicator (L) because they can also be transferred over MRP (see Mes­ sage Reliability Protocol in [\[MatterCore\]](#_bookmark8)) in pages that fit within the MRP MTU limit. However, an implementation MAY leverage a transport like TCP that allows large payloads, if available, to mini­ mize the number of messages required to transfer the corresponding payload.
>
> The cluster server for Channel is implemented by an endpoint that controls the current Channel.

If the server does not find an available track for the title being played exactly matching a Track requested here, in the list of available tracks, it may default to picking another track that closely matches the requested track. Alternately, it may go with user preferences set on the server side (it will use this option if these PlaybackPreferences are not specified). In the case of text tracks, that may mean that the subtitle text is not displayed at all. In the cases where the preferred Text/AudioTracks are not available, the server SHALL return the TextTrackNotAvailable and/or AudioTrackNotAvailable Status(es) in the LauncherResponse.

5.  **UseCurrentContext Field**

> This field, if present, SHALL indicate whether to consider the context of current ongoing activity on the receiver to fulfill the request. For example if the request only includes data in ContentSearch that specifies an Episode number, and UseCurrentContent is set to TRUE, if there is a TV series on going, the request refers to the specific episode of the ongoing season of the TV series. TRUE means current activity context MAY be considered FALSE means current activity context SHALL NOT be considered

##### LaunchURL Command

> Upon receipt, this SHALL launch content from the specified URL.
>
> The content types supported include those identified in the AcceptHeader and SupportedStreaming­ Protocols attributes.

##### CurrentState Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the current playback state of media.
>
> During fast-forward, rewind, and other seek operations; this attribute SHALL be set to PLAYING.

##### StartTime Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the start time of the media, in case the media has a fixed start time (for example, live stream or television broadcast), or null when start time does not apply to the cur­ rent media (for example, video-on-demand). This time is a UTC time. The client needs to handle con­ version to local time, as required, taking in account time zone and possible local DST offset.

##### Duration Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the duration, in milliseconds, of the current media being played back
>
> or null when duration is not applicable (for example, in live streaming content with no known duration). This attribute SHALL never be 0.

##### SampledPosition Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the position of playback (Position field) at the time (UpdateAt field) specified in the attribute. The client MAY use the SampledPosition attribute to compute the current position within the media stream based on the PlaybackSpeed, PlaybackPositionStruct.UpdatedAt and PlaybackPositionStruct.Position fields. To enable this, the SampledPosition attribute SHALL be updated whenever a change in either the playback speed or the playback position is triggered out­ side the normal playback of the media. The events which MAY cause this to happen include:

- Starting or resumption of playback

- Seeking

- Skipping forward or backward

- Fast-forwarding or rewinding

- Updating of playback speed as a result of explicit request, or as a result of buffering events

##### PlaybackSpeed Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the speed at which the current media is being played. The new Play­ backSpeed SHALL be reflected in this attribute whenever any of the following occurs:

- Starting of playback

- Resuming of playback

- Fast-forwarding

- Rewinding

> The PlaybackSpeed SHALL reflect the ratio of time elapsed in the media to the actual time taken for the playback assuming no changes to media playback (for example buffering events or requests to pause/rewind/forward).

- A value for PlaybackSpeed of 1 SHALL indicate normal playback where, for example, playback for 1 second causes the media to advance by 1 second within the duration of the media.

- A value for PlaybackSpeed which is greater than 0 SHALL indicate that as playback is happen­ ing the media is currently advancing in time within the duration of the media.

- A value for PlaybackSpeed which is less than 0 SHALL indicate that as playback is happening the media is currently going back in time within the duration of the media.

- A value for PlaybackSpeed of 0 SHALL indicate that the media is currently not playing back. When the CurrentState attribute has the value of PAUSED, NOT_PLAYING or BUFFERING, the PlaybackSpeed SHALL be set to 0 to reflect that the media is not playing.

> Following examples illustrate the PlaybackSpeed attribute values in various conditions.

| **Seconds of Media Played** | **Actual Time Taken in Seconds** | **Direction of playback** | **PlaybackSpeed** |
|----|----|----|----|
| 2 | 2 | Forward | 1.0 |
| 2 | 1 | Forward | 2.0 |
| 1 | 2 | Forward | 0.5 |
| 2 | 2 | Reverse | -1.0 |
| 2 | 1 | Reverse | -2.0 |
| 1 | 2 | Reverse | -0.5 |

##### SeekRangeStart Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the earliest valid position to which a client MAY seek back, in mil­ liseconds from start of the media. A value of Nas SHALL indicate that seeking backwards is not allowed.

##### SeekRangeEnd Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the furthest forward valid position to which a client MAY seek for­ ward, in milliseconds from the start of the media. When the media has an associated StartTime, a value of null SHALL indicate that a seek forward is valid only until the current time within the media, using a position computed from the difference between the current time offset and Start­ Time, in milliseconds from start of the media, truncating fractional milliseconds towards 0. A value of Nas when StartTime is not specified SHALL indicate that seeking forward is not allowed.

##### ActiveAudioTrack Attribute

> ActiveTrack refers to the Audio track currently set and being used for the streaming media. A value of null SHALL indicate that no Audio Track corresponding to the current media is currently being played.

##### AvailableAudioTracks Attribute

> AvailableAudioTracks refers to the list of Audio tracks available for the current title being played. A value of null SHALL indicate that no Audio Tracks corresponding to the current media are selec­ table by the client.

##### ActiveTextTrack Attribute

> ActiveTrack refers to the Text track currently set and being used for the streaming media. This can be nil. A value of null SHALL indicate that no Text Track corresponding to the current media is cur­ rently being displayed.

##### AvailableTextTracks Attribute

> AvailableTextTracks refers to the list of Text tracks available for the current title being played. This can be an empty list. A value of null SHALL indicate that no Text Tracks corresponding to the cur­ rent media are selectable by the client.

| 2 | **Data** | octstr | max 900 |  |  | O |

##### TargetList Field

> This field SHALL indicate the updated target list as defined by the TargetList attribute if there is a change in the list of targets. Otherwise this field can be omitted from the event.

##### Data Field

> This field SHALL indicate Optional app-specific data.

## Content App Observer Cluster

> This cluster provides an interface for sending targeted commands to an Observer of a Content App on a Video Player device such as a Streaming Media Player, Smart TV or Smart Screen.
>
> The cluster server for Content App Observer is implemented by an endpoint that communicates with a Content App, such as a Casting Video Client.
>
> The cluster client for Content App Observer is implemented by a Content App endpoint.
>
> A Content App is informed of the NodeId of an Observer when a binding is set on the Content App. For a Content App Platform, the binding is set by the platform when a CastingVideoClient is granted access to the Content App, and the CastingVideoClient supports the Content App Observer cluster. The Content App can then send the ContentAppMessage to the Observer (server cluster), and the Observer responds with a ContentAppMessageResponse.
>
> The Data and EncodingHint fields of the ContentAppMessage and ContentAppMessageResponse contain content app-specific values, the format and interpretation of which is defined by the Con­ tent App vendor, analogous to the custom message features offered by other popular casting proto­ cols. Standardized cluster and commands are used here rather than manufacturer-specific cluster and commands because of the role that the Content App Platform plays in creating the ACLs and Bindings on both sides of the communication between the Content App Observer endpoint and the Content App endpoint.
>
> By using standard cluster and commands:

1.  The Content App Platform is able to easily determine that a binding is needed on the Content App endpoint because it can recognize the Content App Observer cluster implemented by a client node.

2.  The Content App Platform is able to easily identify commands that are allowed to be sent by the Content App to a client node because those commands use the Content App Observer cluster.

3.  The Content App is able to easily determine that a node supports the Content App Observer clus­ ter because it has received a binding which specifies the Content App Observer cluster.

4.  The Casting Video Client is able to support a single cluster for receiving commands from any Content App and does not need to explicitly list every Content App it understands.

> A Content App Observer SHOULD ignore the Data and EncodingHint field values in commands from a Content App it does not recognize. A Content App SHOULD ignore the Data field values in responses when the EncodingHint value is blank or not recognized.

##### Enabled Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate whether the Content Control feature implemented on a media device is turned off (FALSE) or turned on (TRUE).

##### OnDemandRatings Attribute

> This attribute SHALL provide the collection of ratings that are currently valid for this media device. The items should honor the metadata of the on-demand content (e.g. Movie) rating system for one country or region where the media device has been provisioned. For example, for the MPAA sys­ tem, RatingName may be one value out of "G", "PG", "PG-13", "R", "NC-17".
>
> The media device SHALL have a way to determine which rating system applies for the on-demand content and then populate this attribute. For example, it can do it through examining the Location attribute in the Basic Information cluster, and then determining which rating system applies.
>
> The ratings in this collection SHALL be in order from a rating for the youngest viewers to the one for the oldest viewers. Each rating in the list SHALL be unique.

##### OnDemandRatingThreshold Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate a threshold rating as a content filter which is compared with the rat­ ing for on-demand content. For example, if the on-demand content rating is greater than or equal to OnDemandRatingThreshold, for a rating system that is ordered from lower viewer age to higher viewer age, then on-demand content is not appropriate for the User and the Node SHALL prevent the playback of content.
>
> This attribute SHALL be set to one of the values present in the OnDemandRatings attribute.
>
> When this attribute changes, the device SHOULD make the user aware of any limits of this feature. For example, if the feature does not control content within apps, then the device should make this clear to the user when the attribute changes.

##### ScheduledContentRatings Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate a collection of ratings which ScheduledContentRatingThreshold can be set to. The items should honor metadata of the scheduled content rating system for the country or region where the media device has been provisioned.
>
> The media device SHALL have a way to determine which scheduled content rating system applies and then populate this attribute. For example, this can be done by examining the Location attribute in Basic Information cluster, and then determining which rating system applies.
>
> The ratings in this collection SHALL be in order from a rating for the youngest viewers to the one for the oldest viewers. Each rating in the list SHALL be unique.

##### ScheduledContentRatingThreshold Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate a threshold rating as a content filter which is used to compare with the rating for scheduled content. For example, if the scheduled content rating is greater than or equal to ScheduledContentRatingThreshold for a rating system that is ordered from lower viewer age to higher viewer age, then the scheduled content is not appropriate for the User and SHALL be blocked.
>
> This attribute SHALL be set to one of the values present in the ScheduledContentRatings attribute.
>
> When this attribute changes, the device SHOULD make the user aware of any limits of this feature. For example, if the feature does not control content within apps, then the device should make this clear to the user when the attribute changes.

>
> This attribute SHALL be updated when the AddBonusTime command is received and processed suc­ cessfully (with the correct PIN).

##### BlockUnrated Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate whether the playback of unrated content is allowed when the Con­ tent Control feature is activated. If this attribute equals FALSE, then playback of unrated content SHALL be permitted. Otherwise, the media device SHALL prevent the playback of unrated content.
>
> When this attribute changes, the device SHOULD make the user aware of any limits of this feature. For example, if the feature does not control content within apps, then the device should make this clear to the user when the attribute changes.

##### BlockChannelList Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate a set of channels that SHALL be blocked when the Content Control feature is activated.

##### BlockApplicationList Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate a set of applications that SHALL be blocked when the Content Control feature is activated.

##### BlockContentTimeWindow Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate a set of periods during which the playback of content on media device SHALL be blocked when the Content Control feature is activated. The media device SHALL reject any request to play content during one period of this attribute. If it is entering any one period of this attribute, the media device SHALL block content which is playing and generate an event EnteringBlockContentTimeWindow. There SHALL NOT be multiple entries in this attribute list for the same day of week.

##### UpdatePIN Command

> The purpose of this command is to update the PIN used for protecting configuration of the content control settings. Upon success, the old PIN SHALL no longer work.
>
> The PIN is used to ensure that only the Node (or User) with the PIN code can make changes to the Content Control settings, for example, turn off Content Controls or modify the ScreenDailyTime. The PIN is composed of a numeric string of up to 6 human readable characters (displayable) .
>
> Upon receipt of this command, the media device SHALL check if the OldPIN field of this command is the same as the current PIN. If the PINs are the same, then the PIN code SHALL be set to NewPIN. Otherwise a response with InvalidPINCode error status SHALL be returned.
>
> The media device MAY provide a default PIN to the User via an out of band mechanism. For security reasons, it is recommended that a client encourage the user to update the PIN from its default value when performing configuration of the Content Control settings exposed by this cluster. The Reset­ PIN command can also be used to obtain the default PIN.

##### AddBonusTime Command

> The purpose of this command is to add the extra screen time for the user.
>
> If a client with Operate privilege invokes this command, the media device SHALL check whether the PINCode passed in the command matches the current PINCode value. If these match, then the RemainingScreenTime attribute SHALL be increased by the specified BonusTime value.
>
> If the PINs do not match, then a response with InvalidPINCode error status SHALL be returned, and no changes SHALL be made to RemainingScreenTime.
>
> If a client with Manage privilege or greater invokes this command, the media device SHALL ignore the PINCode field and directly increase the RemainingScreenTime attribute by the specified Bonus­ Time value.
>
> A server that does not support the PM feature SHALL respond with InvalidPINCode to clients that only have Operate privilege unless:

- It has been provided with the PIN value to expect via an out of band mechanism, and

- The client has provided a PINCode that matches the expected PIN value.

## Temperature Control Cluster

> This cluster provides an interface to the setpoint temperature on devices such as washers, refriger­ ators, and water heaters. The setpoint temperature is the temperature to which a device using this cluster would attempt to control to. This cluster does not provide access to the actual or physical temperature associated with any device using this cluster. Access to the physical temperature asso­ ciated with a device using this cluster would be provided by other clusters as part of that devices device type definition.
>
> The values and constraints of the attributes communicated to clients SHOULD match the controls on any physical interface on a device implementing this server. For example, the value of the Step attribute SHOULD match the incremental value by which the temperature setpoint can be changed on the physical device.

> **NOTE** \* See temperature data type, in the data model, for encoding units.

##### TemperatureSetpoint Attribute

> This attribute SHALL represent the desired Temperature Setpoint on the device.

##### MinTemperature Attribute

> This attribute SHALL represent the minimum temperature to which the TemperatureSetpoint attribute MAY be set.

##### MaxTemperature Attribute

> This attribute SHALL represent the maximum temperature to which the TemperatureSetpoint attribute MAY be set.
>
> If the Step attribute is supported, this attribute SHALL be such that MaxTemperature = MinTemper­ ature + Step \* n, where n is an integer and n \> 0. If the Step attribute is not supported, this attribute SHALL be such that MaxTemperature \> MinTemperature.

##### Step Attribute

> This attribute SHALL represent the discrete value by which the TemperatureSetpoint attribute can be changed via the SetTemperature command.

##### SelectedTemperatureLevel Attribute

> This attribute SHALL represent the currently selected temperature level setting of the server. This attribute SHALL be the positional index of the list item in the SupportedTemperatureLevels list that represents the currently selected temperature level setting of the server.

##### SupportedTemperatureLevels Attribute

> This attribute SHALL represent the list of supported temperature level settings that may be selected via the TargetTemperatureLevel field in the SetTemperature command. Each string is readable text that describes each temperature level setting in a way that can be easily understood by humans. For example, a washing machine can have temperature levels like "Cold", "Warm", and "Hot". Each string is specified by the manufacturer.
>
> Each item in this list SHALL represent a unique temperature level. Each entry in this list SHALL have a unique value. The entries in this list SHALL appear in order of increasing temperature level with list item 0 being the setting with the lowest temperature level.

### Commands

|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0x00 | **SetTempera­ ture** | client ⇒ server | Y | O | M |

##### SetTemperature Command

> The SetTemperature command SHALL have the following data fields:

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **TargetTem­ perature** | temperature | desc |  |  | TN |
| 1 | **TargetTem­ pera­ tureLevel** | uint8 | desc |  |  | TL |

1.  **TargetTemperature Field**

> This field SHALL specify the desired temperature setpoint that the server is to be set to.
>
> The TargetTemperature SHALL be from MinTemperature to MaxTemperature inclusive. If the Step attribute is supported, TargetTemperature SHALL be such that (TargetTemperature - MinTempera­ ture) % Step == 0.

2.  **TargetTemperatureLevel Field**

> This field SHALL specify the index of the list item in the SupportedTemperatureLevels list that rep­ resents the desired temperature level setting of the server. The value of this field SHALL be between 0 and the length of the SupportedTemperatureLevels list -1.

3.  **Effect on Receipt**

> If the TargetTemperature or TargetTemperatureLevel fields of the command meet all constraints but the server is unable to execute the command at the time the command is received by the server (e.g. due to the design of a device it cannot accept a change in its temperature setting after it has begun operation), then the server SHALL respond with a status code of INVALID_IN_STATE, and dis­ card the command.
>
> If the TN feature is supported, on receipt of this command,

- If the value of the TargetTemperature field meets all constraints, the server SHALL set the Tem­ peratureSetpoint attribute to the value of the TargetTemperature field and the response SHALL have a status code of SUCCESS.

- Otherwise (e.g. if the value of the TargetTemperature field falls outside of the constraints of the TemperatureSetpoint attribute or if the Step attribute is supported in the server and the value of the TargetTemperature field is such that (TargetTemperature - MinTemperature) % Step != 0), the status of the response SHALL be CONSTRAINT_ERROR and the value of the TemperatureSet­ point attribute SHALL remain unchanged.

> If the TL feature is supported, on receipt of this command,

- If value of the TargetTemperatureLevel field meets all constraints, the server SHALL set its SelectedTemperatureLevel attribute to the value of TargetTemperatureLevel field and respond with status SUCCESS.

- Otherwise (e.g. if the value of the TargetTemperatureLevel field is out of bounds of the Support­ edTemperatureLevels list), the status of the response SHALL be CONSTRAINT_ERROR, and the value of SelectedTemperatureLevel SHALL remain unchanged.

##### SpinSpeeds Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the list of spin speeds available to the appliance in the currently selected mode. The spin speed values are determined by the manufacturer. At least one spin speed value SHALL be provided in the SpinSpeeds list. The list of spin speeds MAY change depending on the currently selected Laundry Washer mode. For example, Quick mode might have a completely different list of SpinSpeeds than Delicates mode.

##### SpinSpeedCurrent Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the currently selected spin speed. It is the index into the SpinSpeeds list of the selected spin speed, as such, this attribute can be an integer between 0 and the number of entries in SpinSpeeds - 1. If a value is received that is outside of the defined constraints, a CON­ STRAINT_ERROR SHALL be sent as the response. If a value is attempted to be written that doesn’t match a valid index (e.g. an index of 5 when the list has 4 values), a CONSTRAINT_ERROR SHALL be sent as the response. If null is written to this attribute, there will be no spin speed for the selected cycle. If the value is null, there will be no spin speed on the current mode.

##### NumberOfRinses Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate how many times a rinse cycle SHALL be performed on a device for the current mode of operation. A value of None SHALL indicate that no rinse cycle will be per­ formed. This value may be set by the client to adjust the number of rinses that are performed for
>
> the current mode of operation. If the device is not in a compatible state to accept the provided value, an INVALID_IN_STATE error SHALL be sent as the response.

##### SupportedRinses Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the amount of rinses allowed for a specific mode. Each entry SHALL indicate a NumberOfRinsesEnum value that is possible in the selected mode on the device. The value of this attribute MAY change at runtime based on the currently selected mode. Each entry SHALL be distinct.

1.  **TimeToAdd Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the number of seconds to be added to the CookTime attribute.

2.  **Effect on Receipt**

> Upon receipt of this command, if the sum of the value of the TimeToAdd field and the current value of the CookTime attribute is greater than the MaxCookTime attribute, the server SHALL respond with a response of CONSTRAINT_ERROR and the command SHALL be ignored.

## Device Energy Management Cluster

> This cluster allows a client to manage the power draw of a device. An example of such a client could
>
> be an Energy Management System (EMS) which controls an Energy Smart Appliance (ESA).
>
> In most deployments the EMS will be the client, and the ESA will host the Device Energy Manage­ ment Cluster server.

![](media/image66.png)

> *Figure 17. Example of the how an EMS is a client of multiple ESAs Device Energy Management clusters.*
>
> This cluster is intended to be generic in nature and could apply to any electrical load or generator (e.g. a Battery Electric Storage System - BESS, solar PV inverter, EVSE, HVAC, heat pump, hot water heater, white goods appliances etc).
>
> It consists of the following areas which SHALL be supported by all devices implementing this clus­ ter:

- Description of ESA and its capabilities & power limits (sometimes referred to as a nameplate)

- Current state of operation (including user opt-out, safety limitations / alarms) There are some optional capabilities that some ESAs may be able to offer:

- Ability to control the load or generation

- Forecast data, including when it can be flexible (i.e. modify the power or time period)

- The ability to have their power profile adjusted by an EMS, and to provide an updated Forecast back to the EMS.

> This allows the EMS to manage multiple home loads and where ESAs can be flexible, continuously optimizing the home energy to minimize cost, reduce CO2 impact, maximize self-consumption of solar PV and provide Demand Side Response (DSR) Grid services.
>
> It is likely that the ESA may also use the Pricing Cluster to obtain incentive signals such as 'grid car­ bon intensity', 'time of use' or 'type of use' tariffs to schedule its operation to run at the cheapest and greenest times.
>

##### NOTE

> Grid Services are market dependent and will use other protocols (\[[OpenADR](#_bookmark19)\] / \[[IEEE2030.5](#_bookmark16)\]) to communicate grid events to the EMS. These are outside the scope of Matter.

##### NOTE

> Different markets may follow different approaches, but the UK \[[PAS1878](#_bookmark20)\] and \[[EUCodeOfConduct](#_bookmark14)\] give examples of how ESAs may be mandated to support these features in the future.

### Features

> This cluster SHALL support the FeatureMap bitmap attribute as defined below.

| **Bit** | **Code** | **Feature** | **Conformance** | **Summary** |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **PA** | PowerAdjustment | O | Allows an EMS to make a temporary power adjustment (within the limits offered by the ESA). |
| 1 | **PFR** | PowerForecastRe­ porting | \[!PA\].a,(STA\|PAU\| FA\|CON),O | Allows an ESA to advertise its indicative future power consump­ tion vs time. |
| 2 | **SFR** | StateForecastRe­ porting | \[!PA\].a | Allows an ESA to advertise its indicative future state vs time. |
| 3 | **STA** | StartTimeAdjust­ ment | O | Allows an EMS to delay an ESA’s planned opera­ tion. |
| 4 | **PAU** | Pausable | O | Allows an EMS to pause an ESA’s planned opera­ tion. |
| 5 | **FA** | ForecastAdjust­ ment | O | Allows an EMS to adjust an ESA’s planned opera­ tion. |
| 6 | **CON** | Constraint­ BasedAdjustment | O | Allows an EMS to request con­ straints to an ESA’s planned opera­ tion. |

> The conformance rules specified above can be described as:

- At least one of the features SHALL be supported.

- At most one of the 'SFR' and 'PFR' features SHALL be supported.

- If one or more of the 'STA', 'PAU', 'FA', or 'CON' features are supported, then either the 'PFR' or the 'SFR' feature SHALL also be supported.

  - If PA is supported, SFR SHALL NOT be supported

##### PowerAdjustment Feature

> For Energy Smart Appliances (ESA) the definition of being 'smart' mandates that they can report their current power adjustment capability and have an EMS request a temporary adjustment. This may typically be to curtail power requirements during peak periods, but can also be used to turn on an ESA if there is excess renewable or local generation (Solar PV).
>
> For example, a home may have solar PV which often produces more power than the home requires, resulting in the excess power flowing into the grid. This excess power naturally fluctuates when clouds pass overhead and other loads in the home are switched on and off.
>
> **EVSE Example:** An EMS may therefore be able to turn on the EVSE (if the vehicle is plugged in) and can start charging the vehicle, and periodically modify the charging power depending on PV gener­ ation and other home loads, so as to minimize import and export to the grid. An EMS may also use this feature to control the discharging (and re-charging) of the vehicle if the EVSE and vehicle sup­ port the V2X feature of the EVSE cluster of the associated EVSE device.

##### PowerForecastReporting Feature

> For Energy Smart Appliances (ESA) the definition of being 'smart' implies that they can report their indicative forecast power demands or generation, to a greater or lesser extent. For some ESAs this is highly predictable (in terms of both power and time), in other appliances this is more challenging and only a basic level of forecast is possible.
>
> Forecasts are defined from a current time, using a slot format, where the slot is akin to a relatively constant operating mode.
>
> **Washing machine example:** a washing machine may have stages of a washing cycle: heating, tum­ bling, rinse and spin stages. At each stage, the approximate minimum and maximum power con­ sumption may be known, as well as the duration of that stage.
>
> In some circumstances the ESA may allow the stage to be delayed or paused (subject to safety and manufacturer’s discretion and user preferences).
>
> Typically, appliances with a heating element cannot have their power consumption adjusted and can only be paused or delayed.
>
> Some ESAs may not be flexible other than a delayed cycle start (for example, once the washing cycle has been started then they run continuously until the cycle completes).
>
> Appliances that only support the PowerForecastReporting and not any of the adjustment features may indicate that they are not flexible in the forecast slot format.
>
> The PowerForecastReporting and the adjustment features aim to align to the \[[SAREF4ENER](#_bookmark25)\] ontol­ ogy.
>
> **Inverter driven ESAs:** some inverter driven ESAs can consume or generate a variable amount of power.
>
> For example, a single phase EVSE can be adjusted in the range of 6-32Amps in 0.6 Amp steps in EU or on a hardwired 120V supply in the range of 6-15 Amps in US.
>
> For example, a home battery may be adjusted to charge or discharge in steps of 1W.
>
> For example, a heat pump may be able to modulate its compressor inverter between 20-100% of its rated power.
>
> The ESA indicates its power adjustment range and its nominal power consumption as part of its Forecast.

##### StateForecastReporting Feature

> Some ESAs do not know their actual power consumption, but do know the state of operation. Like the PowerForecastingReporting feature, this uses the same slot structure mechanism to indicate a change in state vs time.
>
> An external observing EMS may have access to real-time meter readings, and could learn the typi­ cal power consumption based on the advertised internal state of the ESA.
>
> To enable this capability, the ESA SHALL report its internal operational state using an manufacturer specific value.
>
> Once the EMS has built a model of the state vs observed power consumption, it may request a fore­ cast adjustment for particular times of the day, encouraging the ESA to use power at alternative times.

##### StartTimeAdjustment Feature

> ESAs which support the Start Time Adjustment feature, allow an EMS to recommend a change to the start time of the energy transfer that the ESA has previously suggested it would use.
>
> **Washing machine example:** A Washing Machine may have been set to start a wash cycle at 9pm when the variable tariff normally reduces.
>
> However, the EMS is aware that a grid event has occurred, making it cheaper to run the cycle at a later time, but the washing machine is not aware of this.
>
> The EMS first requests the Forecast data from each of its registered ESAs. It determines that the washing machine has a power profile suggesting it will start the wash cycle at 9pm, but the EMS now knows that the grid event means it will be cheaper to delay the start until 11pm.
>
> The EMS can then optimize the cost by asking the washing machine to delay starting the wash cycle until 11pm.
>
> It does this by sending a [StartTimeAdjustRequest](#starttimeadjustrequest-command) to the washing machine to request delaying the start of the washing cycle.

##### Pausable Feature

> ESAs which support the Pausable feature, allow an EMS to recommend a pause in the middle of a
>
> forecast power profile that the ESA is currently using.
>
> **Washing machine example:** A Washing Machine is in operation, and starting its water heating step.
>
> However, the EMS becomes aware from the smart meter that the total home load on the grid is close to exceeding its allowed total grid load.
>
> The EMS first requests the Forecast data from each of its registered ESAs. It determines that the washing machine has a power profile suggesting its current step in the wash cycle is using power to heat the water, but that this step can be paused.
>
> The EMS can then reduce the grid load by asking the washing machine to pause the wash cycle for a short duration.
>
> It does this by sending a [PauseRequest](#pauserequest-command) to the washing machine to request pausing the current step of the forecast power usage for a period to allow other home loads to finish before resuming the washing cycle.

##### ForecastAdjustment Feature

> ESAs which support the Forecast adjustment feature, allow an EMS to recommend a change to the start, duration and/or power level limits of the steps of the power profile that the ESA has previ­ ously suggested it would use.
>
> **Heat pump and Solar PV example:** A heat pump may have the ability to heat hot water as well as heating the home. The heat pump scheduling system may have determined that the home will be unoccupied during the day, or that the indoor temperature is above the set-point and so it knows that it will not need to heat the home.
>
> However, the hot water tank is likely to need to be reheated before the homeowner comes home in the evening. The heat pump is not aware that the property also has a solar PV inverter which is also an ESA that is communicating with the EMS.
>
> The EMS first requests the Forecast data from each of its registered ESAs. It determines that the heat pump has a power profile suggesting it needs to heat hot water around 6pm. The solar PV inverter has forecast that it will generate 3.6kW of power during the middle of the day and into the afternoon before the sun goes down.
>
> The EMS can then optimize the home considering other non-ESA loads and can ask the heat pump to heat the hot water around 3pm when it has forecast that excess solar power will be available.
>
> It does this by sending a [ModifyForecastRequest](#modifyforecastrequest-command) to the heat pump and asks the heat pump to expect to run at a lower power consumption (within the solar excess power) which requires the heat pump to run for a longer duration to achieve its required energy demand.

##### ConstraintBasedAdjustment Feature

> ESAs which support the Constraint-Based Adjustment feature allow an EMS to inform the ESA of periods during which power usage should be modified (for example when the EMS has been made aware that the grid supplier has requested reduced energy usage due to overall peak grid demand)
>
> and may cause the ESA to modify the intended power profile has previously suggested it would use.
>
> **EVSE example:** An EVSE scheduling system may have determined that the vehicle would be charged starting at a moderate rate at 1am, so that it has enough charge by the time it is needed later that morning.
>
> However, the DSR service provider has informed the EMS that due to high forecast winds it is now forecast that there will be very cheap energy available from wind generation between 2am and 3am.
>
> The EMS first requests the Forecast data from each of its registered ESAs. It determines that the EVSE has a power profile suggesting it plans to start charging the vehicle at 1am.
>
> The EMS can then try to reduce the cost of charging the EV by informing the EVSE of the desire to increase the charging between scheduled times.
>
> It does this by sending a [RequestConstraintBasedForecast](#requestconstraintbasedforecast-command) to the EVSE and asks it to run at a higher [NominalPower](#_bookmark1041) consumption during the constraint period, which may require it to decrease its charge rate outside the constraint period to achieve its required energy demand.

### Dependencies

> This cluster does not report electrical power and electrical energy. Devices that use this cluster SHALL also support the Electrical Power Measurement and optionally support the Electrical Energy Measurement cluster to allow an energy management system to perform its role. See Device Type library for device specific details.

### Definitions

##### Power

> Power is defined in the main specification (see Data Model) in units of milliwatts. It is a signed value, where positive values indicate the direction of power flow into the node. A negative value indicates that the device is supplying power, and thus reducing the overall load of the premises on the grid supply.
>
> ![](media/image68.png)
>
> *Figure 19. Power flows into devices*
>
> **Solar PV inverter example:** A solar PV inverter is normally connected to the premises' wiring, so its generation power will be indicated as a negative integer, since power is flowing out of the node towards the mains connection. Note that at night (when there is no solar production) the PV inverter will consume some standby power, and this will result in a small positive power reading.
>
> **Grid Power:** Power from the grid is measured by a utility meter which is imported into the node, so positive power values indicate that power is flowing into the premises. Negative values indicate power is flowing back towards the grid.
>
> **EVSE example:** An EVSE provides power to the EV (when charging) so a positive value indicates that the power is flowing into the EVSE from the mains supply when the EV is charging, and is act­ ing as a load on the grid supply, and negative value indicates that the EV is discharging.
>
> **BESS example:** A battery storage inverter normally provides power to loads when discharging, so negative power indicates discharging (power is flowing back to the mains supply) therefore reduc­ ing the load on the grid, and positive power indicates power flowing from the mains to the battery during charging (adding load to the grid).
>
> **Washing Machine example:** A washing machine only consumes power (i.e. is a load), so it will always have a positive power value.

##### Energy

> Energy is defined in the main specification (see Data Model). This is defined in units of mWh (milli­ watt-hours). It is signed value, where positive values indicate the direction of current flow towards a load.

| 2         | **Comfort**      | Consumer comfort impact cost | M               |
| 3         | **Temperature**  | Temperature impact cost      | M               |

1.  **Financial Value**

> This value SHALL indicate that the cost is related to the financial cost to provide the energy.

2.  **GHGEmissions Value**

> This value SHALL indicate that the cost is related to greenhouse gas emissions (in grams of CO2e).

3.  **Comfort Value**

> This value SHALL indicate that the cost is related to some abstract sense of comfort expressed by the consumer; a higher value indicates more discomfort. For example, a consumer may be more comfortable knowing that their EV is charged earlier in the day in case there is a sudden need to depart and drive to the hospital. Or the consumer may feel inconvenienced by the fact that they need to wait for the washing machine to finish its load so that they can use it again.

4.  **Temperature Value**

> This value SHALL indicate that the cost is related to the temperature of the home or water being at its setpoint. Some consumers may be more sensitive to being too hot or too cold.
>
> This is expressed in degrees Celsius.

2.  **Value Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the value of the cost. This may be negative (indicating that it is not a cost, but a free benefit).
>
> For example, if the Value was -302 and DecimalPoints was 2, then this would represent a benefit of 3.02.

3.  **DecimalPoints Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the number of digits to the right of the decimal point in the Value field. For example, if the Value was 102 and DecimalPoints was 2, then this would represent a cost of 1.02.

4.  **Currency Field**

> Indicates the currency for the value in the [Value](#_bookmark1022) field. The value of the currency field SHALL match the values defined by \[[ISO 4217](#_bookmark17)\].

5.  **MinPower Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the minimum power that the ESA can have its power adjusted to.
>
> Note that this is a signed value. Negative values indicate power flows out of the node (e.g. discharg­ ing a battery).

6.  **MaxPower Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the maximum power that the ESA can have its power adjusted to.
>
> Note that this is a signed value. Negative values indicate power flows out of the node (e.g. discharg­ ing a battery).
>
> For example, if the charging current of an EVSE can be adjusted within the range of 6A to 32A on a 230V supply, then the power adjustment range is between 1380W and 7360W. Here the MinPower would be 1380W, and MaxPower would be 7360W.
>
> For example, if a battery storage inverter can discharge between 0 to 3000W towards a load, then power is flowing out of the node and is therefore negative. Its MinPower would be -3000W and its MaxPower would be 0W.
>
> In another example, if a battery storage inverter can charge its internal battery, between 0W and 2000W. Here power is flowing into the node when charging. As such the MinPower becomes 0W and MaxPower becomes 2000W.

7.  **MinDuration field**

> This field SHALL indicate the minimum duration, in seconds, that a controller may invoke an ESA power adjustment. Manufacturers may use this to as an anti-cycling capability to avoid controllers from rapidly making power adjustments.

8.  **MaxDuration field**

> This field SHALL indicate the maximum duration, in seconds, that a controller may invoke an ESA power adjustment. Manufacturers may use this to protect the user experience, to avoid over heat­ ing of the ESA, ensuring that there is sufficient headroom to use or store energy in the ESA or for any other reason.

1.  **PowerAdjustCapability**

> This field SHALL indicate how the ESA can be adjusted at the current time.
>
> For example, a battery storage inverter may need to regulate its internal temperature, or the charg­ ing rate of the battery may be limited due to cold temperatures, or a change in the state of charge of the battery may mean that the maximum charging or discharging rate is limited.
>
> An empty list SHALL indicate that no power adjustment is currently possible.
>
> Multiple entries in the list allow indicating that permutations of scenarios may be possible.
>
> For example, a 10kWh battery could be at 80% state of charge. If charging at 2kW, then it would be full in 1 hour. However, it could be discharged at 2kW for 4 hours.
>
> In this example the list of [PowerAdjustStructs](#poweradjuststruct-type) allows multiple scenarios to be offered as follows:

##### ForecastStruct Type

> This indicates a list of 'slots' describing the overall timing of the ESA’s planned energy and power use, with different power and energy demands per slot. For example, slots might be used to describe the distinct stages of a washing machine cycle.
>
> Where an ESA does not know the actual power and energy use of the system, it may support the SFR

1.  **ForecastID Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the sequence number for the current forecast. If the ESA updates a fore­ cast, it shall monotonically increase this value.
>
> The ESA does not need to persist this value across reboots, since the EMS SHOULD be able to detect that any previous subscriptions are lost if a device reboots. The loss of a subscription and subse­ quent re-subscription allows the EMS to learn about any new forecasts.
>
> The value of ForecastID is allowed to wrap.

2.  **ActiveSlotNumber Field**

> This field SHALL indicate which element of the Slots list is currently active in the Forecast sequence. A null value indicates that the sequence has not yet started.

3.  **StartTime Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the planned start time, in UTC, for the entire Forecast.

4.  **EndTime Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the planned end time, in UTC, for the entire Forecast.

5.  **EarliestStartTime Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the earliest start time, in UTC, that the entire Forecast can be shifted to. A null value indicates that it can be started immediately.

6.  **LatestEndTime Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the latest end time, in UTC, for the entire Forecast.
>
> e.g. for an EVSE charging session, this may indicate the departure time for the vehicle, by which time the charging session must end.

7.  **IsPausable Field**

> This field SHALL indicate that some part of the Forecast can be paused. It aims to allow a client to read this flag and if it is false, then none of the slots contain SlotIsPausable set to true. This can save a client from having to check each slot in the list.

12. **DefaultDuration Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the expected time (in seconds) that the appliance expects to be in this slot for.

13. **ElapsedSlotTime Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the time (in seconds) that has already elapsed whilst in this slot. If the slot has not yet been started, then it SHALL be 0. Once the slot has been completed, then this reflects how much time was spent in this slot.
>
> When subscribed to, a change in this field value SHALL NOT cause the Forecast attribute to be updated since this value may change every 1 second.
>
> When the Forecast attribute is read, then this value SHALL be the most recent value.

14. **RemainingSlotTime Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the time (in seconds) that is estimated to be remaining.
>
> Note that it may not align to the [DefaultDuration](#_bookmark1031) - [ElapsedSlotTime](#_bookmark1032) since an appliance may have revised its planned operation based on conditions.
>
> When subscribed to, a change in this field value SHALL NOT cause the Forecast attribute to be updated, since this value may change every 1 second.
>
> Note that if the ESA is currently paused, then this value SHALL NOT change.
>
> When the Forecast attribute is read, then this value SHALL be the most recent value.

15. **SlotIsPausable Field**

> This field SHALL indicate whether this slot can be paused.

16. **MinPauseDuration Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the shortest period that the slot can be paused for. This can be set to avoid controllers trying to pause ESAs for short periods and then resuming operation in a cyclic fashion which may damage or cause excess energy to be consumed with restarting of an operation.

17. **MaxPauseDuration Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the longest period that the slot can be paused for.

18. **ManufacturerESAState Field**

> This field SHALL indicate a manufacturer defined value indicating the state of the ESA.
>
> This may be used by an observing EMS which also has access to the metering data to ascertain the typical power drawn when the ESA is in a manufacturer defined state.
>
> Some appliances, such as smart thermostats, may not know how much power is being drawn by the HVAC system, but do know what they have asked the HVAC system to do.
>
> Manufacturers can use this value to indicate a variety of states in an unspecified way. For example, they may choose to use values between 0-100 as a percentage of compressor modulation, or could use these values as Enum states meaning heating with fan, heating without fan etc.
>
> **NOTE** An ESA SHALL always use the same value to represent the same operating state.
>
> By providing this information a smart EMS may be able to learn the observed power draw when the ESA is put into a specific state. It can potentially then use the ManufacturerESAState field in the Forecast attribute along with observed power drawn to predict the power draw from the appliance and potentially ask it to modify its timing via one of the adjustment request commands, or adjust other ESAs power to compensate.

19. **NominalPower Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the expected power that the appliance will use during this slot. It may be considered the average value over the slot, and some variation from this would be expected (for example, as it is ramping up).

20. **MinPower Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the lowest power that the appliance expects to use during this slot. (e.g. during a ramp up it may be 0W).
>
> Some appliances (e.g. battery inverters which can charge and discharge) may have a negative power.

21. **MaxPower Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the maximum power that the appliance expects to use during this slot. (e.g. during a ramp up it may be 0W). This field ignores the effects of short-lived inrush currents.
>
> Some appliances (e.g. battery inverters which can charge and discharge) may have a negative power.

22. **NominalEnergy Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the expected energy that the appliance expects to use or produce during this slot.
>
> Some appliances (e.g. battery inverters which can charge and discharge) may have a negative energy.

23. **Costs Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the current estimated cost for operating.
>
> For example, if the device has access to an Energy pricing server it may be able to use the tariff to estimate the cost of energy for this slot in the power forecast.
>
> When an Energy Management System requests a change in the schedule, then the device MAY sug­ gest a change in the cost as a result of shifting its energy. This can allow a demand side response service to be informed of the relative cost to use energy at a different time.
>
> The Costs field is a list of CostStruct structures which allows multiple CostTypeEnum and Values to be shared by the energy appliance. These could be based on GHG emissions, comfort value for the consumer etc.
>
> For example, comfort could be expressed in abstract units or in currency. A water heater that is heated earlier in the day is likely to lose some of its heat before it is needed, which could require a top-up heating event to occur later in the day (which may incur additional cost).
>
> If the ESA cannot calculate its cost for any reason (such as losing its connection to a Price server) it may omit this field. This is treated as extra meta data that an EMS may use to optimize a system.

24. **MinPowerAdjustment Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the minimum power that the appliance can be requested to use.
>
> For example, some EVSEs cannot be switched on to charge below 6A which may equate to ~1.3kW in EU markets. If the slot indicates a [NominalPower](#_bookmark1035) of 0W (indicating it is expecting to be off), this allows an ESA to indicate it could be switched on to charge, but this would be the minimum power limit it can be set to.

25. **MaxPowerAdjustment Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the maximum power that the appliance can be requested to use.
>
> For example, an EVSE may be limited by its electrical supply to 32A which would be ~7.6kW in EU markets. If the slot indicates a [NominalPower](#_bookmark1035) of 0W (indicating it is expecting to be off), this allows an ESA to indicate it could be switched on to charge, but this would be the maximum power limit it can be set to.

26. **MinDurationAdjustment Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the minimum time, in seconds, that the slot can be requested to short­ ened to.
>
> For example, if the slot indicates a [NominalPower](#_bookmark1035) of 0W (indicating it is expecting to be off), this would allow an ESA to specify the minimum time it could be switched on for. This is to help protect the appliance from being damaged by short cycling times.
>
> For example, a heat pump compressor may have a minimum cycle time of order a few minutes.

27. **MaxDurationAdjustment Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the maximum time, in seconds, that the slot can be requested to extended to.
>
> For example, if the slot indicates a [NominalPower](#_bookmark1035) of 0W (indicating it is expecting to be off), this allows an ESA to specify the maximum time it could be switched on for. This may allow a battery or water heater to indicate the maximum duration that it can charge for before becoming full. In the case of a battery inverter which can be discharged, it may equally indicate the maximum time the battery could be discharged for (at the [MaxPowerAdjustment](#_bookmark1036) power level).

##### ConstraintsStruct Type

> The ConstraintsStruct allows a client to inform an ESA about a constraint period (such as a grid event, or perhaps excess solar PV). The format allows the client to suggest that the ESA can either turn up its energy consumption, or turn down its energy consumption during this period.

> This field SHALL indicate the maximum energy that can be transferred to or from the ESA during the constraint period.
>
> This is a signed value and can be used to indicate charging or discharging.

35. **LoadControl Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the turn up or turn down nature that the grid wants as the outcome by the ESA during the constraint period.
>
> This is expressed as a signed value between -100 to +100. A value of 0 would indicate no bias to using more or less energy. A negative value indicates a request to use less energy. A positive value indicates a request to use more energy.

##### ESAType Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the type of ESA.
>
> This attribute enables an EMS to understand some of the basic properties about how the energy may be consumed, generated, and stored by the ESA.
>
> For example, the heat energy converted by a heat pump will naturally be lost through the building to the outdoor environment relatively quickly, compared to storing heat in a well-insulated hot water tank. Similarly, battery storage and EVs can store electrical energy for much longer dura­ tions.
>
> This attribute can also help the EMS display information to a user and to make basic assumptions about typical best use of energy. For example, an EVSE may not always have an EV plugged in, so knowing the type of ESA that is being controlled can allow advanced energy management strate­ gies.

##### ESACanGenerate Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate whether the ESA is classed as a generator or load. This allows an EMS to understand whether the power values reported by the ESA need to have their sign inverted when dealing with forecasts and adjustments.
>
> For example, a solar PV inverter (being a generator) may produce negative values to indicate gener­ ation (since power is flowing out of the node into the home), however a display showing the power to the consumers may need to present a positive solar production value to the consumer.
>
> For example, a home battery storage system (BESS) which needs to charge the battery and then dis­ charge to the home loads, would be classed as a generator. These types of devices SHALL have this field set to true. When generating its forecast or advertising its PowerAdjustmentCapability, the power values shall be negative to indicate discharging to the loads in the home, and positive to indi­ cate when it is charging its battery.
>
> Example:

| **Home has the following loads:** |       |
|----------------------------------:|------:|
|                     Water Heater: | 3000W |
|                               TV: |  200W |
|                    FridgeFreezer: |  200W |

| **Total:** | **3400W** |
|------------|-----------|

| **Home has the following generators (ESACanGenerate = true)** |            |
|--------------------------------------------------------------:|-----------:|

##### ESAState Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the current state of the ESA.
>
> If the ESA is in the Offline or Fault state it cannot be controlled by an EMS, and may not be able to report its Forecast information. An EMS may subscribe to the [ESAState](#esastate-attribute) to get notified about changes in operational state.
>
> The ESA may have a local user interface to allow a service technician to put the ESA into Offline mode, for example to avoid the EMS accidentally starting or stopping the appliance when it is being serviced or tested.

##### AbsMinPower Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the minimum electrical power that the ESA can consume when switched on. This does not include when in power save or standby modes.

##### NOTE

> For Generator ESAs that can discharge an internal battery (such as a battery storage inverter) to loads in the home, the [AbsMinPower](#absminpower-attribute) will be a negative number repre­ senting the maximum power that the ESA can discharge its internal battery.

##### AbsMaxPower Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the maximum electrical power that the ESA can consume when switched on.
>
> Note that for Generator ESAs that can charge a battery by importing power into the node (such as a battery storage inverter), the [AbsMaxPower](#absmaxpower-attribute) will be a positive number representing the maximum power at which the ESA can charge its internal battery.
>
> For example, a battery storage inverter that can charge its battery at a maximum power of 2000W and can discharge the battery at a maximum power of 3000W, would have a AbsMinPower: -3000, AbsMaxPower: 2000W.

##### PowerAdjustmentCapability Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate how the ESA can be adjusted at the current time, and the state of any active adjustment.
>
> A null value indicates that no power adjustment is currently possible, and nor is any adjustment currently active.
>
> This attribute SHOULD be updated periodically by ESAs to reflect any changes in internal state, for example temperature or stored energy, which would affect the power or duration limits.
>
> Changes to this attribute SHALL only be marked as reportable in the following cases:

- At most once every 10 seconds on changes, or

- When it changes from null to any other value and vice versa.

##### Forecast Attribute

> This attribute allows an ESA to share its intended forecast with a client (such as an Energy Manage­ ment System).
>
> A null value indicates that there is no forecast currently available (for example, a program has not yet been selected by the user).
>
> A server MAY reset this value attribute to null on a reboot, and it does not need to persist any previ­ ous forecasts.
>
> Changes to this attribute SHALL only be marked as reportable in the following cases:

- At most once every 10 seconds on changes, or

- When it changes from null to any other value and vice versa, or

- As a result of a command which causes the forecast to be updated, or

- As a result of a change in the opt-out status which in turn may cause the ESA to recalculate its forecast.

##### OptOutState Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the current Opt-Out state of the ESA. The ESA may have a local user interface to allow the user to control this OptOutState. An EMS may subscribe to the [OptOutState](#optoutstate-attribute) to get notified about changes in operational state.
>
> If the ESA is in the LocalOptOut or OptOut states, so it cannot be controlled by an EMS for local opti­ mization reasons, it SHALL reject any commands which have the [AdjustmentCauseEnum](#adjustmentcauseenum-type) value LocalOptimization. If the ESA is in the GridOptOut or OptOut states, so it cannot be controlled by an EMS for grid optimization reasons, it SHALL reject any commands which have the [Adjustment­](#adjustmentcauseenum-type) [CauseEnum](#adjustmentcauseenum-type) value GridOptimization.
>
> If the user changes the Opt-Out state of the ESA which is currently operating with a Forecast that is due to a previous [StartTimeAdjustRequest](#starttimeadjustrequest-command), [ModifyForecastRequest](#modifyforecastrequest-command) or [RequestConstraintBasedFore­](#requestconstraintbasedforecast-command) [cast](#requestconstraintbasedforecast-command) command that would now not be permitted due to the new Opt-out state (i.e. the [Forecast](#forecast-attribute)
>
> attribute [ForecastUpdateReason](#_bookmark1029) field currently contains a reason which is now opted out), the ESA SHALL behave as if it had received a [CancelRequest](#cancelrequest-command) command.
>
> If the user changes the Opt-Out state of the ESA which currently has the [ESAStateEnum](#esastateenum-type) with value Paused due to a previous [PauseRequest](#pauserequest-command) command that would now not be permitted due to the new Opt-out state, and the ESA supports the PFR or SFR features (i.e. the [Forecast](#forecast-attribute) attribute [ForecastUp­](#_bookmark1029) [dateReason](#_bookmark1029) field currently contains a reason which is now opted out), the ESA SHALL behave as if it had received a [ResumeRequest](#resumerequest-command) command.
>
> If the user changes the Opt-Out state of the ESA which currently has the [ESAStateEnum](#esastateenum-type) with value PowerAdjustActive due to a previous [PowerAdjustRequest](#poweradjustrequest-command) command that would now not be permit­ ted due to the new Opt-out state (i.e. the [Forecast](#forecast-attribute) attribute [ForecastUpdateReason](#_bookmark1029) field currently contains a reason which is now opted out), the ESA SHALL behave as if it had received a [Can­](#cancelpoweradjustrequest-command) [celPowerAdjustRequest](#cancelpoweradjustrequest-command) command.
>
> If the ESA is in the LocalOptOut, GridOptOut, or NoOptOut states, the device is still permitted to optimize its own energy usage, for example, using tariff information it may obtain.

##### PowerAdjustRequest Command

> Allows a client to request an adjustment in the power consumption of an ESA for a specified dura­ tion.

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **Power** | power-mW | desc |  |  | M |

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 1 | **Duration** | elapsed-s | desc |  |  | M |
| 2 | **Cause** | [Adjustment­](#adjustmentcauseenum-type) [CauseEnum](#adjustmentcauseenum-type) | desc |  |  | M |

1.  **Power Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the power that the ESA SHALL use during the adjustment period.
>
> This value SHALL be between the MinPower and MaxPower fields of the [PowerAdjustStruct](#poweradjuststruct-type) in the PowerAdjustmentCapability attribute.

2.  **Duration Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the duration that the ESA SHALL maintain the requested power for.
>
> This value SHALL be between the MinDuration and MaxDuration fields of the [PowerAdjustStruct](#poweradjuststruct-type) in the PowerAdjustmentCapability attribute.

3.  **Cause Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the cause of the request from the EMS.

4.  **Effect on receipt**

> On receipt of this command, the ESA SHALL validate that the Power and Duration specified in the command are within the limits of its current operation and advertised [PowerAdjustmentCapability](#poweradjustmentcapability-attribute) attribute, the [OptOutState](#optoutstate-attribute) permits the specified [AdjustmentCauseEnum](#adjustmentcauseenum-type) (see [OptOutState](#optoutstate-attribute) for details), and the [ESAState](#esastate-attribute) is Online.
>
> If the PowerAdjustRequest command is accepted, then the ESA SHALL change its [ESAState](#esastate-attribute) to Pow­ erAdjustActive, and the [PowerAdjustmentCapability](#poweradjustmentcapability-attribute) attribute SHALL be updated to set the Cause value from the Cause field of this command.
>
> The command status returned SHALL be SUCCESS if the adjustment is accepted; otherwise the com­ mand SHALL be rejected with CONSTRAINT_ERROR if the Power, Duration, or Cause values are not permitted as above, or with FAILURE otherwise.

##### Start of adjustment

> The ESA SHALL generate a [PowerAdjustStart](#poweradjuststart-event) Event when it begins to adjust its power.
>
> The ESA then begins to adjust its power consumption or generation to the power level commanded in the Power field.

##### End of adjustment (normal completion)

> After the elapsed duration, the ESA SHALL revert to normal (or idle) power levels.
>
> The ESA SHALL also generate a [PowerAdjustEnd](#poweradjustend-event) Event with a cause code to indicate a 'Normal
>
> completion', the [ESAState](#esastate-attribute) SHALL be restored to Online, and the [PowerAdjustmentCapability](#poweradjustmentcapability-attribute) attribute SHALL be updated to set the Cause value to 'NoAdjustment'.

##### Failure or Opt-out during adjustment

> If during the power adjustment session a failure or other condition occurs (such as the user decid­ ing to opt-out by updating the [OptOutState](#optoutstate-attribute)) then the ESA SHALL generate a [PowerAdjustEnd](#poweradjustend-event) Event to indicate the end of the session, with the appropriate cause code.
>
> The [ESAState](#esastate-attribute) SHALL be updated to reflect the new state, and the [PowerAdjustmentCapability](#poweradjustmentcapability-attribute) attribute SHALL be updated to set the Cause value to 'NoAdjustment'.

##### Receiving a new PowerAdjustRequest command when adjustment is on-going

> If an existing power adjustment is already happening, and a new PowerAdjustRequest command is received, then if the ESA allows it, the ESA SHALL return SUCCESS, and the [PowerAdjustmentCapa­](#poweradjustmentcapability-attribute) [bility](#poweradjustmentcapability-attribute) attribute SHALL be updated to set the Cause value from the Cause field of the new command. If the ESA does not permit this new PowerAdjustmentRequest command to interrupt the adjust­ ment that is in progress, it SHALL return BUSY.
>
> Note that if the new command is accepted, then the ESA SHALL NOT generate a new [PowerAdjus­](#poweradjustend-event) [tEnd](#poweradjustend-event) Event until the new duration has elapsed. This is to avoid generating too many events in cases where a device is routinely commanded with overlapping power adjustments.
>
> For example, a battery inverter ESA may be sent a new request every 5 seconds to adjust its dis­ charge power based on real-time meter readings. Each command may have a 60 second duration, but this command is superseded after 5 seconds by a new request.
>
> After the client has sent its last command and after this command duration expires then the last active power adjustment has been completed. This final command causes the [PowerAdjustEnd](#poweradjustend-event) Event to be generated when the [ESAState](#esastate-attribute) is restored to Online, and the [PowerAdjustmentCapability](#poweradjustmentcapability-attribute) attribute SHALL be updated to set the Cause value to 'NoAdjustment'.

##### CancelPowerAdjustRequest Command

> Allows a client to cancel an ongoing PowerAdjustmentRequest operation.
>
> **9.2.9.2.1. Effect on receipt**
>
> On receipt of this command, the ESA SHALL end the active power adjustment session and return to normal (or idle) power levels.
>
> If the [ESAState](#esastate-attribute) is not PowerAdjustActive, then the command SHALL be rejected with INVALID_IN_S­ TATE.
>
> If the command is accepted, the ESA SHALL generate an [PowerAdjustEnd](#poweradjustend-event) Event and the [ESAState](#esastate-attribute) SHALL be restored to Online, the [PowerAdjustmentCapability](#poweradjustmentcapability-attribute) attribute SHALL be updated to set the Cause value to 'NoAdjustment', and the command status returned SHALL be SUCCESS.

##### StartTimeAdjustRequest Command

> Allows a client to adjust the start time of a Forecast sequence that has not yet started operation (i.e. where the current Forecast StartTime is in the future).

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **Requested­ StartTime** | epoch-s | desc |  |  | M |
| 1 | **Cause** | [Adjustment­](#adjustmentcauseenum-type) [CauseEnum](#adjustmentcauseenum-type) | all |  |  | M |

1.  **RequestedStartTime Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the requested start time, in UTC, that the client would like the appliance to shift its Forecast to. This value MUST be in the future.
>
> A client can estimate the entire Forecast sequence duration by computing the [EndTime](#_bookmark1028) - [StartTime](#_bookmark1027) fields from the [Forecast](#forecast-attribute) attribute, and therefore avoid scheduling the start time too late.
>
> This value SHALL be after the EarliestStartTime in the Forecast attribute. The new EndTime, that can be computed from the RequestedStartTime and the Forecast sequence duration, SHALL be before the LatestEndTime.

2.  **Cause Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the cause of the request from the EMS.

3.  **Effect on receipt**

> On receipt of this command, if the ESA supports STA, and the [OptOutState](#optoutstate-attribute) permits the specified [AdjustmentCauseEnum](#adjustmentcauseenum-type) (see [OptOutState](#optoutstate-attribute) for details), and the RequestedStartTime adjustment would be within constraints described in [RequestedStartTime](#_bookmark1053) then ESA SHALL accept the request to modify the Start Time.
>
> If the RequestedStartTime value resulted in a time shift which is outside the time constraints of Ear­ liestStartTime and LatestEndTime, or the Cause is not permitted, then the command SHALL be rejected with CONSTRAINT_ERROR; in other failure scenarios the command SHALL be rejected with FAILURE.
>
> The command status returned SHALL be SUCCESS if the StartTime in the Forecast is updated. The ESA SHALL update its [Forecast](#forecast-attribute) attribute using the new [RequestedStartTime](#_bookmark1053) including a new Fore­ castID, StartTime, EndTime, and [ForecastUpdateReason](#_bookmark1029).

##### PauseRequest Command

> Allows a client to temporarily pause an operation and reduce the ESAs energy demand.

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **Duration** | elapsed-s | desc |  |  | M |
| 1 | **Cause** | [Adjustment­](#adjustmentcauseenum-type) [CauseEnum](#adjustmentcauseenum-type) | all |  |  | M |

1.  **Duration Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the duration that the ESA SHALL be paused for. This value SHALL be between the MinPauseDuration and MaxPauseDuration indicated in the ActiveSlotNumber index in the Slots list in the Forecast.

2.  **Cause Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the cause of the request from the EMS.

3.  **Effect on receipt**

> On receipt of this command, if the ESA supports PAU and the SlotIsPausable field is true in the ActiveSlotNumber index in the Slots list, the [OptOutState](#optoutstate-attribute) permits the specified [Adjustment­](#adjustmentcauseenum-type) [CauseEnum](#adjustmentcauseenum-type) (see [OptOutState](#optoutstate-attribute) for details), and the [OptOutState](#optoutstate-attribute) is Online or PowerAdjustActive, the ESA SHALL allow its current operation to be Paused. If the Cause is not permitted, then the com­ mand SHALL be rejected with CONSTRAINT_ERROR.
>
> If the ESA SlotIsPausable field is false for the ActiveSlotNumber, then the command SHALL be rejected with FAILURE.
>
> The ESA SHALL validate that the Duration field is within the range of [MinPauseDuration](#_bookmark1033) and [Max­](#_bookmark1034) [PauseDuration](#_bookmark1034). If it is outside of this range then the command SHALL be rejected with CONSTRAIN­ T_ERROR.
>
> The command status returned SHALL be SUCCESS if the ESA is paused.
>
> Once the command has been accepted, the ESA SHALL also generate a [Paused](#paused-event) Event and the [ESAS­](#esastate-attribute) [tate](#esastate-attribute) SHALL be set to Paused.
>
> The ESA SHALL update its update its [Forecast](#forecast-attribute) to account for the pause, including updating the [Fore­](#_bookmark1029) [castUpdateReason](#_bookmark1029) from the Cause field.
>
> **Pause timer start** The ESA SHALL start a Pause timer based on the value of the Duration field.
>
> **Paused State** Whilst in the Paused state, the ESA SHALL NOT consume or produce significant power (other than required to keep its basic control system operational).
>
> **Pause timer expiry** When the Pause timer expires the ESA SHALL automatically resume operation. When it does this, then it SHALL also generate a [Resumed](#resumed-event) Event and the [ESAState](#esastate-attribute) SHALL be updated accordingly to reflect its current state (for example, it may still have PowerAdjustActive now it has resumed from the Pause). The ESA SHALL update its [Forecast](#forecast-attribute) including setting [Forecas­](#_bookmark1029) [tUpdateReason](#_bookmark1029) to InternalOptimization to account for the resumption after the pause.
>
> **Receiving a further pause request command whilst paused** If a further Pause Request is received in the same forecast slot whilst already in the paused state, the ESA SHALL again validate that the Duration value is within the range of the (possibly revised) [MinPauseDuration](#_bookmark1033) and [Max­](#_bookmark1034) [PauseDuration](#_bookmark1034). If it is outside of this range then the command SHALL be rejected with CONSTRAIN­ T_ERROR.
>
> If the command is accepted the pause timer SHALL be extended by the new Duration.
>
> **ResumeRequest** A client MAY send a ResumeRequest command, before the Pause timer has expired, to request the ESA to return to its normal operating state. See [ResumeRequest](#resumerequest-command) for details.
>
> **Failure or Opt-out during PauseRequest** A consumer MAY decide to opt-out of the remotely com­ manded PauseRequest by updating the [OptOutState](#optoutstate-attribute), and the ESA SHALL also change the [ESAState](#esastate-attribute) to the new state.
>
> If the ESA develops a fault whilst Paused, the [ESAState](#esastate-attribute) SHALL be set to Fault.
>
> On change of [ESAState](#esastate-attribute) (from Paused to another state), the ESA SHALL generate a [Resumed](#resumed-event) Event.

##### ResumeRequest Command

> Allows a client to cancel the PauseRequest command and enable earlier resumption of operation.
>
> **9.2.9.5.1. Effect on receipt**
>
> On receipt of this command, if the ESA supports PAU and it is currently Paused, the ESA MAY decide not to resume immediately if the [MinPauseDuration](#_bookmark1033) has not yet elapsed. This behavior is manufac­ turer specific.
>
> If accepted, the ESA SHALL resume its operation. The ESA SHALL also generate a [Resumed](#resumed-event) Event and the [ESAState](#esastate-attribute) SHALL be updated accordingly to reflect its current state.
>
> The command status returned SHALL be SUCCESS if the operation is resumed, or the command SHALL be rejected with the response INVALID_IN_STATE if the ESA is not currently Paused, other­ wise the command SHALL be rejected with FAILURE.
>
> The ESA SHALL update its [Forecast](#forecast-attribute) including setting [ForecastUpdateReason](#_bookmark1029) to InternalOptimization
>
> to account for the resumption after the pause.

##### ModifyForecastRequest Command

> Allows a client to modify a Forecast within the limits allowed by the ESA.

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|

1.  **ForecastID Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the ForecastID that is to be modified.

2.  **SlotAdjustments Field**

> This field SHALL contain a list of SlotAdjustment parameters that should be modified in the corre­ sponding Forecast with matching ForecastID.

3.  **Cause Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the cause of the request from the EMS.

4.  **Effect on receipt**

> On receipt of this command, if the ESA supports FA, and the [OptOutState](#optoutstate-attribute) permits the specified [AdjustmentCauseEnum](#adjustmentcauseenum-type) (see [OptOutState](#optoutstate-attribute) for details), it SHALL attempt to adjust its forecast.
>
> The client may be an energy management system which has retrieved the forecasts from multiple ESA and then performed some optimization (for example, taking advantage of local solar PV gener­ ation).
>
> The ESA SHALL inspect the requested forecast and ensure that it does not exceed the limits set in each of its slots. The ESA manufacturer may also reject the request if it could cause the user’s pref­ erences to be breached (for example, if it may cause the home to be too hot or too cold, or a battery to be insufficiently charged).
>
> Note that the client may make an adjustment when the ESA’s program has already been started. In this case the ActiveSlotNumber may have moved through the Forecast sequence. Any attempts to modify slots which have already been run SHALL result in the entire command being rejected.
>
> The command allows a single modification to a particular slot, or to multiple slots in a single com­ mand by sending a list of modifications.
>
> If the ESA accepts the requested Forecast then it SHALL update its [Forecast](#forecast-attribute) attribute (incrementing its [ForecastID](#_bookmark1026), and updating its [ForecastUpdateReason](#_bookmark1029) from the Cause value) and run the revised Forecast as its new intended operation.
>
> Note that an ESA may adapt its Forecast based on a slot modification. For example, if an ESA was switched on earlier in the day to take account of available solar PV, then it may not need to use energy later in the day. It may add or remove slots as it chooses. This may result in several itera­ tions for the Energy Management System to reprocess updated forecasts until it has stabilized on an agreed set of changes.
>
> If for any reason the ESA cannot accept the entire requested forecast adjustments then it SHALL
>
> reject the entire command.
>
> If the Cause is not permitted, or the requested forecast exceeds any of the limits in the respective slots, then the command SHALL be rejected with CONSTRAINT_ERROR, otherwise if the ForecastID is valid, and the entire list of [SlotAdjustmentStruct](#slotadjustmentstruct-type) are accepted, the command status returned SHALL be SUCCESS, otherwise the command SHALL be rejected with FAILURE.

##### RequestConstraintBasedForecast Command

> Allows a client to ask the ESA to recompute its Forecast based on power and time constraints.

1.  **Constraints Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the series of turn up or turn down power requests that the ESA is being asked to constrain its operation within. These requests SHALL be in the future, SHALL be in chronological order, starting with the earliest start time, and SHALL NOT overlap in time.
>
> For example, a grid event which requires devices to reduce power (turn down) between 4pm and 6pm and due to excess power on the grid overnight, may request ESAs to increase their power demand (turn up) between midnight and 6am.
>
> If this ESA supports PFR this would have 2 entries in the list as follows:

| **Entry \[0\] - Turn Down** |                     |           |
|----------------------------:|---------------------|-----------|

> If this ESA supports SFR where it does not know the actual power, but has an understanding of the functions that use more energy, it could be requested to use more or less energy using the LoadCon­
>
> trol field as follows:

| **Entry \[0\] - Turn Down** |                     |                  |
|----------------------------:|---------------------|------------------|

2.  **Cause Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the cause of the request from the EMS.

3.  **Effect on receipt**

> On receipt of this command, if the ESA supports CON, and the [OptOutState](#optoutstate-attribute) permits the specified [AdjustmentCauseEnum](#adjustmentcauseenum-type) (see [OptOutState](#optoutstate-attribute) for details), it may be requested to generate a new forecast by a client.
>
> For example the client may be an energy management system which has determined that the peak load on the home should be reduced (for example a grid event) or that there is more local genera­ tion available and the solar export power needs to be consumed.
>
> The EMS may not be best placed to make the forecast adjustment because the ESA knows more about its internal operation and system efficiencies.
>
> For example the total energy used when charging a battery faster may result in increased heat losses in the inverter, so the total energy required to charge a battery with 10kWh of stored energy may vary based on charging power.
>
> The ESA SHALL inspect the constraints field to ensure that the constraints defined for that field and its elements are met. The ESA manufacturer may also reject the request if it could cause the user’s preferences to be breached (e.g. may cause the home to be too hot or too cold, or a battery to be insufficiently charged).
>
> If the ESA can meet the requested power limits, it SHALL regenerate a new Power Forecast with a new [ForecastID](#_bookmark1026) and [ForecastUpdateReason](#_bookmark1029) from the Cause value.
>
> If an appliance has already begun running a program (and agreed to modify its schedule), it may continue to run the same program and meet the same user settings (e.g. ECO mode), but may take more or less time to complete the cycle. The new reported Forecast will start from the current time,
>
> i.e. the slots that have already been completed SHALL NOT be included in the new forecast.

##### CancelRequest Command

> Allows a client to request cancellation of a previous adjustment request in a [StartTimeAdjustRe­](#starttimeadjustrequest-command) [quest](#starttimeadjustrequest-command), [ModifyForecastRequest](#modifyforecastrequest-command) or [RequestConstraintBasedForecast](#requestconstraintbasedforecast-command) command.
>
> **9.2.9.8.1. Effect on receipt**
>
> On receipt of this command, the ESA SHALL attempt to cancel the effects of any previous adjust­ ment request commands, and re-evaluate its forecast for intended operation ignoring those previ­ ous requests.
>
> If the ESA [ForecastUpdateReason](#_bookmark1029) was already Internal Optimization, then the command SHALL be rejected with INVALID_IN_STATE.
>
> If the command is accepted, the ESA SHALL update its [ESAState](#esastate-attribute) if required, and the command sta­ tus returned SHALL be SUCCESS. The ESA SHALL update its [Forecast](#forecast-attribute) attribute to match its new intended operation, and update the [ForecastUpdateReason](#_bookmark1029) to Internal Optimization.

## Energy EVSE Cluster

> Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) is equipment used to charge an Electric Vehicle (EV) or Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle. This cluster provides an interface to the functionality of Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) management.
>
> Devices targeted by this cluster include Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE). The cluster generically assumes a signaling protocol (J1772 in NA and IEC61851 in Europe and Asia) between the EVSE and Electric Vehicle (EV) that utilizes a pilot signal to manage the states of the charging process. \[[SAE J2847/3_202311](#_bookmark24)\] version and IEC61841 define Pilot signal as a modulated DC voltage on a single wire.
>
> Power Line Communication (PLC) is supported by some EVSEs (e.g. for support of ISO 15118 in Europe and SAE J2931/4 in NA) and may enable features such as Vehicle to Grid (V2G) or Vehicle to
>
> Home (V2H) that allows for bi-directional charging/discharging of electric vehicles.
>
> More modern EVSE devices may optionally support ISO 15118-20 in Europe and SAE J2836/3 for NA to support bi-directional charging (Vehicle to Grid - V2G) and Plug and Charge capabilities.
>
> This cluster definition assumes AC charging only. DC charging options may be added in future revi­ sions of this cluster.
>
> This cluster supports a safety mechanism that may lockout remote operation until the initial latch­ ing conditions have been met. Some of the fault conditions defined in SAE J1772, such as Ground- Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI) or Charging Circuit Interrupting Device (CCID), may require clear­ ing by an operator by, for example, pressing a button on the equipment or breaker panel.
>
> This EVSE cluster is written around support of a single EVSE. Having multiple EVSEs at home or a business is managed by backend system and outside scope of this cluster.
>
> Note that in many deployments the EVSE may be outside the home and may suffer from intermit­ tent network connections (e.g. a weak WiFi signal). It also allows for a charging profile to be pre- configured, in case there is a temporary communications loss during a charging session.

| **Bit** | **Code** | **Feature** | **Conformance** | **Summary** |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **PREF** | ChargingPrefer­ ences | M | EVSE supports storing user charg­ ing preferences |

| 3 | **RFID** | RFID | O | EVSE is fitted with an RFID reader |
| 4 | **V2X** | V2X | P,O | EVSE supports bi- directional charg­ ing / discharging |

##### ChargingPreferences Feature

> Since some EVSEs cannot obtain the SoC from the vehicle, some EV charging solutions allow the consumer to specify a daily charging target (for adding energy to the EV’s battery). This feature allows the consumer to specify how many miles or km of additional range they need for their typi­ cal daily commute. This range requirement can be converted into a daily energy demand with a tar­ get charging completion time.
>
> The EVSE itself can use this information (or may allow a controller such as an EMS) to compute an optimized charging schedule.
>
> An EVSE device which includes a Device Energy Management device with the Device Energy Man­ agement cluster PFR (Power Forecast Reporting) feature can use the charging preferences informa­ tion to produce its power forecast.
>
> EVSE devices that support the Device Energy Management cluster’s FA feature can have their charg­ ing profiles set by a controller device such as an EMS. For example, if the EVSE advertises a simple power forecast which allows the EMS to adjust over a wide range of power and time durations, then the EVSE may allow the EMS to propose a revised optimized forecast (which is the charging profile). For example, a solar PV ESA may also share its Forecast, so enabling an EMS to adjust the EVSE forecast to the best time to charge so that any excess solar generation is used to charge the EV.
>
> See the [Device Energy Management Cluster](#device-energy-management-cluster) for more details.

##### SoCReporting Feature

> Vehicles and EVSEs which support ISO 15118 may allow the vehicle to report its battery size and state of charge. If the EVSE supports PLC it may have a vehicle connected which optionally supports reporting of its battery size and current State of Charge (SoC).
>
> If the EVSE supports reporting of State of Charge this feature will only work if a compatible EV is connected.
>
> Note some EVSEs may use other undefined mechanisms to obtain vehicle State of Charge outside the scope of this cluster.

##### PlugAndCharge Feature

> If the EVSE supports PLC, it may be able to support the Plug and Charge feature. e.g. this may allow the vehicle ID to be obtained which may allow an energy management system to track energy usage per vehicle (e.g. to give the owner an indicative cost of charging, or for work place charging).
>
> If the EVSE supports the Plug and Charge feature, it will only work if a compatible EV is connected.

##### RFID Feature

> If the EVSE is fitted with an RFID reader, it may be possible to obtain the User or Vehicle ID from an RFID card. This may be used to record a charging session against a specific charging account, and may optionally be used to authorize a charging session.
>
> An RFID event can be generated when a user taps an RFID card onto the RFID reader. The event must be subscribed to by the EVSE Management cluster client. This client may use this to enable the EV to charge or discharge. The lookup and authorization of RIFD UID is outside the scope of this cluster.

##### V2X Feature

> If the EVSE can support bi-directional charging, it may be possible to request that the vehicle can discharge to the home or grid.
>
> The charging and discharging may be controlled by a home Energy Management System (EMS) using the Device Energy Management cluster of the associated Device Energy Management device. For example, an EMS may use the PA (Power Adjustment) feature to continually adjust the charge/discharge current to/from the EV so as to minimise the energy flow from/to the grid as the demand in the home and the solar supply to the home both fluctuate.

### Dependencies

> The server side of this cluster SHALL depend on setting time from another device or using a real- time clock.
>
> This can either use a built-in real-time clock or non Matter time source, or can be derived using the Time Synchronization cluster.

1.  **TargetTimeMinutesPastMidnight Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the desired charging completion time of the associated day. The time will be represented by a 16 bits unsigned integer to designate the minutes since midnight. For example, 6am will be represented by 360 minutes since midnight and 11:30pm will be represented by 1410 minutes since midnight.
>
> This field is based on local wall clock time. In case of Daylight Savings Time transition which may result in an extra hour or one hour less in the day, the charging algorithm should take into account the shift appropriately.
>
> Note that if the TargetTimeMinutesPastMidnight values are too close together (e.g. 2 per day) these may overlap. The EVSE may have to coalesce the charging targets into a single target. e.g. if the 1st charging target cannot be met in the time available, the EVSE may be forced to begin working towards the 2nd charging target and immediately continue until both targets have been satisfied (or the vehicle becomes full).
>
> The EVSE itself cannot predict the behavior of the vehicle (i.e. if it cannot obtain the SoC from the vehicle), so should attempt to perform a sensible operation based on these targets. It is recom­ mended that the charging schedule is pessimistic (i.e. starts earlier) since the vehicle may charge more slowly than the electrical supply may provide power (especially if it is cold).
>
> If the user configures large charging targets (e.g. high values of AddedEnergy or SoC) then it is expected that the EVSE may need to begin charging immediately, and may not be able to guarantee that the vehicle will be able to reach the target.

2.  **TargetSoC Field**

> This field represents the target SoC that the vehicle should be charged to before the Target­ TimeMinutesPastMidnight.
>
> If the EVSE supports the SOC feature and can obtain the SoC of the vehicle:

- the TargetSoC field SHALL take precedence over the AddedEnergy field.

- the EVSE SHOULD charge to the TargetSoC and then stop the charging automatically when it reaches that point.

- if the TargetSoC value is set to 100% then the EVSE SHOULD continue to charge the vehicle until the vehicle decides to stop charging.

> If the EVSE does not support the SOC feature or cannot obtain the SoC of the vehicle:

- the AddedEnergy field SHALL take precedence over the TargetSoC field, and if the EVSE does not support the SOC feature then the TargetSoC field may only take the values null or 100%.

- if the AddedEnergy field has not been provided, the EVSE SHOULD assume the vehicle is empty

> and charge until the vehicle stops demanding a charge.

3.  **AddedEnergy Field**

> This field represents the amount of energy that the user would like to have added to the vehicle before the TargetTimeMinutesPastMidnight.
>
> This represents a positive value in mWh that SHOULD be added during the session (i.e. if the vehi­ cle charging is stopped and started several times, this equates to the total energy since the vehicle has been plugged in).
>
> The maximum value (500kWh) is much larger than most EV batteries on the market today. If the client tries to set this value too high then the EVSE will need to start charging immediately and con­ tinue charging until the vehicle stops demanding charge (i.e. it is full). Therefore the maximum value should be set based on typical battery size of the vehicles on the market (e.g. 70000Wh), how­ ever this is up to the client to carefully choose a value.

##### NOTE

> If the EVSE can obtain the Battery Capacity of the vehicle, it SHOULD NOT limit this AddedEnergy value to the Battery Capacity of the vehicle, since the EV may also require energy for heating and cooling of the battery during charging, or for heat­ ing or cooling the cabin.

[TABLE]

##### State Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the current status of the EVSE. This higher-level status is partly derived from the signaling protocol as communicated between the EVSE and the vehicle through the pilot signal.
>
> The State attribute SHALL change when the EVSE detects change of condition of the EV (plugged in or unplugged, whether the vehicle is asking for demand or not, and if it is charging or discharging).
>
> **NOTE** SessionEnding is not really a state but a transition. However, the transition period may take a few seconds and is useful for some clean up purposes.
>
> The Fault state is used to indicate that the FaultState attribute is not NoError.
>
> A null value SHALL indicate that the state cannot be determined.

##### SupplyState Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate whether the EV is currently allowed to charge from or discharge to the EVSE.

##### FaultState Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the type of fault detected by the EVSE (internally or as detected in the pilot signal).
>
> When the SupplyState attribute is DisabledError, the FaultState attribute will be one of the values listed in [FaultStateEnum](#faultstateenum-type), except NoError. For all values of SupplyState other than DisabledError, the FaultState attribute SHALL be NoError.

##### ChargingEnabledUntil Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the time, in UTC, that the EVSE will automatically stop current flow to the EV.
>
> A null value indicates the EVSE is always enabled for charging.
>
> A value in the past or 0x0 indicates that EVSE charging SHALL be disabled. The attribute is only set via the payload of the [EnableCharging](#enablecharging-command) command.
>
> This attribute SHALL be persisted, for example a temporary power failure should not stop the vehi­ cle from being charged.

##### DischargingEnabledUntil Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the time, in UTC, that the EVSE will automatically stop current flow from the EV.
>
> A null value indicates the EVSE is always enabled for discharging.
>
> A value in the past or 0x0 indicates that EVSE discharging SHALL be disabled. The attribute is only set via the payload of the [EnableDischarging](#enabledischarging-command) command.
>
> This attribute SHALL be persisted, for example a temporary power failure should not stop the vehi­ cle from being discharged.

##### CircuitCapacity Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the capacity that the circuit that the EVSE is connected to can pro­ vide. It is intended to allow implementation of a self-managed network of EVSEs. It is assumed that the device will allow the setting of such values by an installer.

##### MinimumChargeCurrent Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the minimum current that can be delivered by the EVSE to the EV.
>
> The attribute can be set using the [EnableCharging](#enablecharging-command) command.

##### MaximumChargeCurrent Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the maximum current that can be delivered by the EVSE to the EV.
>
> This SHALL represent the actual maximum current offered to the EV at any time. Note that the EV can draw less current than this value. For example, the EV may be limiting its power draw based on the operating conditions of the battery, such as temperature and state of charge.
>
> The attribute can be initially set using the [EnableCharging](#enablecharging-command) command or by adjusting the [UserMaxi­](#usermaximumchargecurrent-attribute) [mumChargeCurrent](#usermaximumchargecurrent-attribute) attribute.

##### MaximumDischargeCurrent Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the maximum current that can be received by the EVSE from the EV. This attribute can be set using the [EnableDischarging](#enabledischarging-command) command.

##### UserMaximumChargeCurrent Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate a maximum current that can set by the consumer (e.g. via an app) as a preference to further reduce the charging rate. This may be desirable if the home owner has a solar PV or battery storage system which may only be able to deliver a limited amount of power. The consumer can manually control how much they allow the EV to take.
>
> This attribute value SHALL be limited by the EVSE to be in the range of:
>
> where MinimumChargeCurrent and MaximumChargeCurrent are the values received in the [EnableCharging](#enablecharging-command) command.
>
> Its default value SHOULD be initialized to the same as the [CircuitCapacity](#circuitcapacity-attribute) attribute. This value SHALL be persisted across reboots to ensure it does not cause charging issues during temporary power failures.

##### RandomizationDelayWindow Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the size of a random window over which the EVSE will randomize the start of a charging session. This value is in seconds.
>
> This is a feature that is mandated in some markets (such as UK) where the EVSE should by default randomize its start time within the randomization window. By default in the UK this should be 600s.
>
> For example, if the RandomizationDelayWindow is 600s (i.e. 10 minutes) and if there was a cheap rate energy starting at 00:30, then the EVSE must compute a random delay between 0-599s and add this to its initial planned start time.

##### NextChargeStartTime Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the time, in UTC, when the EVSE plans to start the next scheduled charge based on the charging preferences.
>
> A null value indicates that there is no scheduled charging (for example, the EVSE Mode is set to use Manual mode tag), or that the vehicle is not plugged in with the SupplyState indicating that charg­ ing is enabled.

##### NextChargeTargetTime Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the time, in UTC, when the EVSE SHOULD complete the next sched­ uled charge based on the charging preferences.
>
> A null value indicates that there is no scheduled charging (for example, the EVSE Mode is set to use Manual mode tag), or that the vehicle is not plugged in with the SupplyState indicating that charg­ ing is enabled.

##### NextChargeRequiredEnergy Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the amount of energy that the EVSE is going to attempt to add to the vehicle in the next charging target.
>
> A null value indicates that there is no scheduled charging (for example, the EVSE Mode is set to use Manual mode tag), or that the vehicle is not plugged in with the SupplyState indicating that charg­ ing is enabled, or that the next [ChargingTargetStruct](#chargingtargetstruct-type) is using the TargetSoC value to charge the vehicle.

##### NextChargeTargetSoC Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the target SoC the EVSE is going to attempt to reach when the vehicle is next charged.
>
> A null value indicates that there is no scheduled charging (for example, the EVSE Mode is set to use
>
> Manual mode tag), or that the vehicle is not plugged in with the SupplyState indicating that charg­ ing is enabled, or that the next [ChargingTargetStruct](#chargingtargetstruct-type) is using the AddedEnergy value to charge the vehicle.
>
> If the SOC feature is not supported, only the values null and 100% are supported.

##### ApproximateEVEfficiency Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the vehicle efficiency rating for a connected vehicle.
>
> This can be used to help indicate to the user *approximately* how many miles or km of range will be added. It allows user interfaces to display to the user simpler terms that they can relate to com­ pared to kWh.
>
> This is value is stored in km per kWh multiplied by a scaling factor of 1000.
>

##### StateOfCharge Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the state of charge of the EV battery in steps of 1%. The values are in the 0-100%. This attribute is only available on EVSEs which can read the state of charge from the vehicle and that support the SOC feature. If the StateOfCharge cannot be read from the vehicle it SHALL be returned with a NULL value.

##### Session Attributes

> The following set of attributes provides information about a charging session, defined as the period from the EVSE detecting an EV plug-in to when it is unplugged.
>
> **NOTE** the session attributes hold their values from the previous session and are reset when the next plug-in event happens.
>
> Whenever the State leaves the NotPluggedIn state and moves to any ‘Plugged’ state (see the [State](#state-attribute-1) attribute), the SessionID attribute SHALL be incremented. The SessionDuration, SessionEnergy­ Charged and SessionEnergyDischarged attributes SHALL be reset to zero.

1.  **SessionID Attribute**

> This attribute SHALL indicate a unique identifier for the current or last session. A value of null indi­ cates no sessions have occurred. The SessionID SHALL be incremented each time a plugin is detected. A session begins when the vehicle is plugged in and ends when the vehicle is unplugged.
>
> SessionIDs are allowed to roll over, although the range of SessionID is a large number and it is unlikely that the EVSE will have this many sessions in its lifetime unless there is a electrical fault causes sessions to be detected at a rapid rate.
>
> If there is no session in progress, the Session ID attribute will remain at the value for the last ses­ sion.

2.  **SessionDuration Attribute**

> This attribute SHALL indicate the duration in seconds for the current or last charging session. A default value of null indicates no sessions have occurred. A charge session begins when the vehicle is plugged in and ends when the vehicle is unplugged.
>
> The SessionDuration can be calculated from the start time of the session. Manufacturers SHALL ensure this can be correctly calculated if there has been an power failure or reboot since the start of the session.
>
> Changes to this attribute SHALL only be marked as reportable in the following cases:

- At most once every 10 seconds on changes, or

- When it changes from null to any other value and vice versa, such as at the beginning and end of a charging session.

3.  **SessionEnergyCharged Attribute**

> This attribute SHALL indicate the energy, in mWh, delivered by the EVSE to the EV for the current or last charging session. A default value of null indicates no sessions have occurred.
>
> The SessionEnergyCharged value can be calculated by knowing the initial value of the energy meter at the start time of the session. Manufacturers SHALL ensure this can be correctly calculated if there has been an power failure or reboot since the start of the session.
>
> Changes to this attribute SHALL only be marked as reportable in the following cases:

- At most once every 10 seconds on changes, or

- When it changes from null to any other value and vice versa, such as at the beginning and end of a charging session.

4.  **SessionEnergyDischarged Attribute**

> This attribute SHALL indicate the energy, in mWh, received by the EVSE from the EV for the current or last charging session. A default value of null indicates no sessions have occurred.
>
> The SessionEnergyDischarged value can be calculated by knowing the initial value of the energy meter at the start time of the session. Manufacturers SHALL ensure this can be correctly calculated if there has been an power failure or reboot since the start of the session.
>
> Changes to this attribute SHALL only be marked as reportable in the following cases:

- At most once every 10 seconds on changes, or

- When it changes from null to any other value and vice versa, such as at the beginning and end of a charging session.

>
> If successful, the [SupplyState](#supplystate-attribute) attribute SHALL be set to DischargingEnabled (if previously Disabled) or Enabled (if previously ChargingEnabled), and a response with status of SUCCESS SHALL be returned.
>
> The timestamp indicated in the [DischargingEnabledUntil](#dischargingenableduntil-attribute) attribute SHALL be updated to the time­ stamp of the DischargingEnabledUntil field if the command is successful.
>
> If the DischargingEnabledUntil is null (i.e. should be permanently enabled), then the EVSE should enable discharging indefinitely.

>
> completion of the diagnostics, the EVSE SHALL restore SupplyState to the Disabled state (see [Sup­](#supplystate-attribute) [plyState](#supplystate-attribute) attribute for further details).

##### SetTargets Command

> Allows a client to set the user specified charging targets.

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |

7.  **ChargingTargetSchedules Field**

> This field SHALL indicate a list of up to 7 sets of daily charging targets together with their associ­ ated days of the week. Each of the days of the week may only be included in a single ChargingTar­ getSchedule within this list field.

8.  **Effect on Receipt**

> On receipt of this command, the EVSE SHALL validate that all of the charging targets are within a valid range, and that each day of the week is included in at most one of the ChargingTargetSched­ ule, if they are not then the response SHALL be CONSTRAINT_ERROR.
>
> When a command is received that requires a total number of charging targets greater than the device supports, the status of the response SHALL be RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED.
>
> If the charging targets are accepted, then the charging targets SHALL be stored for all of days that are set in the DayOfWeekForSequence bitmap fields in all the ChargingTargetSchedules. If a Charg­ ingTargetSchedule is defined with no ChargingTargets then the ChargingTargets are cleared for those days defined in the DayOfWeekForSequence
>
> The SetTargets command is used to update the EVSE’s weekly charging schedule. If the EVSE already has some stored weekly charging targets, then it SHALL replace each daily charging target as it receives the updates from the client. For example, if the EVSE has 2 charging targets for every day of the week and is sent a SetTargets command with one target for Saturday then the EVSE SHALL remove both charging targets for Saturday and replace those with the updated charging tar­ get but leave all other days unchanged.
>
> **NOTE** the EVSE may not be able to compute the schedules by itself, or may rely upon an EMS or other optimizer to do this.
>
> In a standalone mode (e.g. without using a ToU tariff from the Pricing Cluster) the EVSE should be able to compute the latest NextChargeStartTime based on the preset MaximumChargeCurrent attribute and local grid voltage to determine the charging duration required. It should automati­ cally begin charging and following the charging schedule if the EVSE is plugged in (and the EVSE is enabled for charging).
>
> If the EVSE supports the PFR (PowerForecastReporting) feature in the Device Energy Management cluster, it SHALL auto update the Forecast with the indicative power forecast.
>
> If the EVSE supports the FA (ForecastAdjustment) feature in the Device Energy Management cluster, it SHALL indicate its adjustment capability in each of the Forecast slots (see [Device Energy Manage­](#device-energy-management-cluster) [ment Cluster](#device-energy-management-cluster) for more details).
>
> The EVSE SHALL be responsible for updating the NextChargeEndTime, NextChargeRequiredEnergy and/or NextChargeTargetSoC attributes as it runs through its internal schedule. For example, as a scheduled charging session is completed or as it transitions to the next day, it should compute the next time it expects to start charging, and then update the corresponding attributes accordingly.

##### GetTargets Command

> Allows a client to retrieve the current set of charging targets.

9.  **Effect on Receipt**

> On receipt of this command, the EVSE SHALL send the [GetTargetsResponse](#gettargetsresponse-command) command to the client.

##### GetTargetsResponse Command

10. **ChargingTargetSchedules Field**

> This field SHALL indicate a list of up to 7 sets of daily charging targets together with their associ­ ated days of the week.

##### ClearTargets Command

> Allows a client to clear all stored charging targets.

11. **Effect on Receipt**

> On receipt of this command, all weekly targets that are currently stored SHALL be cleared and a default response of SUCCESS SHALL be sent in response. There are no error responses to this com­ mand.
>
> If the EVSE is currently charging based on being in automatic mode, then it SHALL stop the EVSE charging.

2.  **TimeOfUse Tag**

> While in modes with this tag, and once enabled with the EnableCharging command, the EVSE will attempt to automatically start charging based on the user’s charging targets (for example, set based on a Time of Use tariff to charge at the cheapest times of the day).

3.  **SolarCharging Tag**

> While in modes with this tag, and once enabled with the EnableCharging, the EVSE will attempt to
>
> automatically start charging based on available excess solar PV generation, limiting the charging power to avoid importing energy from the grid.

4.  **V2X Tag**

> While in modes with this tag, and once enabled with the EnableDischarging command, the EVSE will permit discharging based on the current charge state of the EV, and its control from an associ­ ated Device Energy Management cluster.

##### NOTE

> being in a mode with this tag set or not does not affect the handling of the EnableDischarging command by the Energy EVSE cluster, but once enabled, only modes with this tag enable the discharging to actually occur.

##### WaterHeaterBoostInfoStruct Type

[TABLE]

1.  **Duration Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the time period, in seconds, for which the boost state is activated.

2.  **OneShot Field**

> This field SHALL indicate whether the boost state SHALL be automatically canceled once the hot water has reached either:

- the set point temperature (from the thermostat cluster)

- the [TemporarySetpoint](#_bookmark1119) temperature (if specified)

- the [TargetPercentage](#_bookmark1120) (if specified).

3.  **EmergencyBoost Field**

> This field SHALL indicate that the consumer wants the water to be heated quickly. This MAY cause multiple heat sources to be activated (e.g. a heat pump and direct electric immersion heating ele­ ment).
>
> The choice of which heat sources are activated is manufacturer specific.

4.  **TemporarySetpoint Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the target temperature to which the water will be heated.
>
> If included, it SHALL be used instead of the thermostat cluster set point temperature whilst the boost state is activated.
>
> The value of this field SHALL be within the constraints of the MinHeatSetpointLimit and MaxHeat­ SetpointLimit attributes (inclusive), of the thermostat cluster.

5.  **TargetPercentage Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the target percentage of hot water in the tank that the TankPercentage attribute must reach before the heating is switched off.

6.  **TargetReheat Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the percentage to which the hot water in the tank SHALL be allowed to fall before again beginning to reheat it.
>
> For example if the [TargetPercentage](#_bookmark1120) was 80%, and the [TargetReheat](#_bookmark1121) was 40%, then after initial heating to 80% hot water, the tank may have hot water drawn off until only 40% hot water remains. At this point the heater will begin to heat back up to 80% of hot water. If this field and the [OneShot](#_bookmark1118) field were both omitted, heating would begin again after any water draw which reduced the [TankPercentage](#tankpercentage-attribute) below 80%.
>
> This field SHALL be less than or equal to the [TargetPercentage](#_bookmark1120) field.

##### HeaterTypes Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the heat sources that the water heater can call on for heating. If a bit is set then the water heater supports the corresponding heat source.

##### HeatDemand Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate if the water heater is heating water. If a bit is set then the corre­ sponding heat source is active.

##### TankVolume Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the volume of water that the hot water tank can hold (in units of Litres). This allows an energy management system to estimate the required heating energy needed to reach the target temperature.

##### EstimatedHeatRequired Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the estimated heat energy needed to raise the water temperature to the target setpoint. This can be computed by taking the specific heat capacity of water (4182 J/kg °C) and by knowing the current temperature of the water, the tank volume and target temperature.

[TABLE]

[TABLE]

> If the TankPercent feature is supported, then this estimate SHALL also take into account the per­ centage of the water in the tank which is already hot.

##### NOTE

> The electrical energy required to heat the water depends on the heating system used to heat the water. For example, a direct electric immersion heating element can be close to 100% efficient, so the electrical energy needed to heat the hot water is nearly the same as the EstimatedHeatEnergyRequired. However some forms of heating, such as an air-source heat pump which extracts heat from ambient air, requires much less electrical energy to heat hot water. Heat pumps can be produce 3kWh of heat output for 1kWh of electrical energy input. The conversion between heat energy and electrical energy is outside the scope of this cluster.

##### TankPercentage Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate an approximate level of hot water stored in the tank, which might help consumers understand the amount of hot water remaining in the tank. The accuracy of this attribute is manufacturer specific.
>
> In most hot water tanks, there is a stratification effect where the hot water layer rests above a cooler layer of water below. For this reason cold water is fed in at the bottom of the tank and the hot water is drawn from the top.
>
> Some water tanks might use multiple temperature probes to estimate the level of the hot water layer. A water heater with multiple temperature probes is likely to implement an algorithm to esti­ mate the hot water tank percentage by taking into account the temperature values of each probe to determine the height of the hot water.
>
> However it might be possible with a single temperature probe to estimate how much hot water is left using a simpler algorithm:

##### BoostState Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate whether the Boost, as triggered by a [Boost](#boost-command) command, is currently
>
> Active or Inactive.
>
> See [Boost](#boost-command) and [CancelBoost](#cancelboost-command) commands for more details.

7.  **Effect on receipt**

> On receipt of this command, this SHALL allow the water heater to attempt to heat the water, which may override other settings, for example, if the Water Heater Mode is set to Off, or Timed and it is during one of the Off periods.
>
> If the duration field is too short for the water heater to accept, for example a heat pump may take several minutes to ramp up in operation, then the boost command SHALL be rejected with a status of INVALID_IN_STATE.
>
> If successful, the value of the [BoostState](#booststate-attribute) attribute SHALL transition to Active, and a response with status of SUCCESS SHALL be returned, and a [BoostStarted](#booststarted-event) event SHALL be generated to include the field values received in the command.
>
> The water in the tank SHALL be heated until one of the following conditions is met:

- the temperature reaches the set point in the corresponding thermostat cluster or the [Tempo­](#_bookmark1119) [rarySetpoint](#_bookmark1119) (if included)

- the [TankPercentage](#tankpercentage-attribute) attribute value reaches the [TargetPercentage](#_bookmark1120) (if it was included)

> If [OneShot](#_bookmark1118) is specified then once the hot water has reached the set point temperature (or the [Tem­](#_bookmark1119) [porarySetpoint](#_bookmark1119) temperature, if specified) or the [TargetPercentage](#_bookmark1120) (if specified), or the boost com­ mand’s duration times out after the specified [Duration](#_bookmark1117), then [BoostState](#booststate-attribute) transitions to Inactive. This SHALL cause the [BoostEnded](#boostended-event) event to be generated.
>
> If the Water Heater was already in the [BoostState](#booststate-attribute) 'Active' when this command is received, it SHALL
>
> continue in this [BoostState](#booststate-attribute), but SHALL discard the effect of the values of the fields from the previ­ ous [Boost](#boost-command) commands, and SHALL continue with the values of the fields from the new [Boost](#boost-command) com­ mand. A new [BoostStarted](#booststarted-event) event SHALL be generated to include the field values received in the new command.

##### CancelBoost Command

> Allows a client to cancel an ongoing Boost operation. This command has no payload.

8.  **Effect on receipt**

> If the [BoostState](#booststate-attribute) attribute value was already Inactive when this command is received, the [Boost­](#booststate-attribute) [State](#booststate-attribute) attribute value shall remain Inactive and the server SHALL return SUCCESS.
>
> Otherwise the Water Heater SHALL transition the [BoostState](#booststate-attribute) to Inactive, generate a [BoostEnded](#boostended-event) event, and the water heating reverts to being controlled through the current Water Heater Mode (e.g. Off, Manual or Timed).

##### EnergyBalances Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate a list of [BalanceStructs](#balancestruct-type), each representing a step along a linear scale of relative priorities. A [Step](#_bookmark1148) field with a value of zero SHALL indicate that the device SHOULD entirely favor the priority specified by the first element in [EnergyPriorities](#energypriorities-attribute); whereas a [Step](#_bookmark1148) field with a value of 100 SHALL indicate that the device SHOULD entirely favor the priority specified by the second element in [EnergyPriorities](#energypriorities-attribute). The midpoint value of 50 SHALL indicate an even split between the two priorities.
>
> This SHALL contain at least two [BalanceStructs](#balancestruct-type).
>
> Each [BalanceStruct](#balancestruct-type) SHALL have a [Step](#_bookmark1148) field larger than the [Step](#_bookmark1148) field on the previous [BalanceStruct](#balancestruct-type) in the list.
>
> The first [BalanceStruct](#balancestruct-type) SHALL have a [Step](#_bookmark1148) value of zero, and the last [BalanceStruct](#balancestruct-type) SHALL have a [Step](#_bookmark1148) value of 100.

##### CurrentEnergyBalance Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the current preference of the user for balancing different priorities during device use. The value of this attribute is the index, 0-based, into the [EnergyBalances](#energybalances-attribute) attribute for the currently selected balance.
>
> If an attempt is made to set this attribute to an index outside the maximum index for [EnergyBal­](#energybalances-attribute) [ances](#energybalances-attribute), a response with the status code CONSTRAINT_ERROR SHALL be returned.
>
> If the value of [EnergyBalances](#energybalances-attribute) changes after an update, the device SHALL migrate the value of the CurrentEnergyBalance attribute to the index which the manufacturer specifies most closely matches the previous value, while preserving extreme preferences as follows:

1.  If the previous value of [CurrentEnergyBalance](#currentenergybalance-attribute) was zero, indicating a total preference for the priority specified by the first element in [EnergyPriorities](#energypriorities-attribute), the new value of [CurrentEnergyBal­](#currentenergybalance-attribute) [ance](#currentenergybalance-attribute) SHALL also be zero.

2.  If the previous value of [CurrentEnergyBalance](#currentenergybalance-attribute) was the index of the last [BalanceStruct](#balancestruct-type) in the previous value of [EnergyBalances](#energybalances-attribute), indicating a total preference for the priority specified by the last element in [EnergyPriorities](#energypriorities-attribute), the new value of [CurrentEnergyBalance](#currentenergybalance-attribute) SHALL be the index of the last element in the updated value of [EnergyBalances](#energybalances-attribute).

##### EnergyPriorities Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate two extremes for interpreting the values in the [EnergyBalances](#energybalances-attribute) attribute. These two priorities SHALL be in opposition to each other; e.g. Comfort vs. Efficiency or Speed vs. WaterConsumption.
>
> If the value of [EnergyPriorities](#energypriorities-attribute) changes after an update to represent a new balance between priori­ ties, the value of the [CurrentEnergyBalance](#currentenergybalance-attribute) attribute SHALL be set to its default.

##### LowPowerModeSensitivities Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate a list of [BalanceStructs](#balancestruct-type), each representing a condition or set of condi­
>
> tions for the device to enter a low power mode. This SHALL contain at least two [BalanceStructs](#balancestruct-type).
>
> Each [BalanceStruct](#balancestruct-type) SHALL have a [Step](#_bookmark1148) field larger than the [Step](#_bookmark1148) field on the previous [BalanceStruct](#balancestruct-type) in the list.

##### CurrentLowPowerModeSensitivity Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the current preference of the user for determining when the device should enter a low power mode. The value of this attribute is the index, 0-based, into the [LowPow­](#lowpowermodesensitivities-attribute) [erModeSensitivities](#lowpowermodesensitivities-attribute) attribute for the currently selected preference.
>
> If an attempt is made to set this attribute to an index outside the maximum index for [LowPower­](#lowpowermodesensitivities-attribute) [ModeSensitivities](#lowpowermodesensitivities-attribute), a response with the status code CONSTRAINT_ERROR SHALL be returned.
>
> If the value of [LowPowerModeSensitivities](#lowpowermodesensitivities-attribute) changes after an update, the device SHALL migrate the value of the LowPowerModeSensitivity attribute to the index which the manufacturer specifies most closely matches the previous value.

|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0x0000 | **SSID** | octstr | 1 to 32 | XN | null | R V | M |
| 0x0001 | **Passphras­ eSurro­ gate** | uint64 | all | XN | null | R M | M |

##### SSID Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the SSID of the primary Wi-Fi network provided by this device.
>
> A value of null SHALL indicate that no primary Wi-Fi network is available (e.g. because the Wi-Fi network has not yet been configured by the user).

##### NOTE

> The SSID in Wi-Fi is a collection of 1-32 bytes, the text encoding of which is not spec­ ified. Implementations must be careful to support transferring these byte strings without requiring a particular encoding. The most common encoding is UTF-8, how­ ever this is just a convention. Some configurations may use Latin-1 or other charac­ ter sets.

##### PassphraseSurrogate Attribute

> This attribute SHALL contain an arbitrary numeric value; this value SHALL increase whenever the passphrase or PSK associated with the primary Wi-Fi network provided by this device changes.
>
> A value of null SHALL indicate that no primary Wi-Fi network is available.
>
> Clients can subscribe to this attribute or compare its value to a locally cached copy to detect if a cached passphrase value has become stale.
>
> It is RECOMMENDED that servers implement this attribute as either a timestamp or a counter. When implemented as a counter it SHOULD be initialized with a random value.

##### NOTE

> The passphrase itself is not exposed as an attribute to avoid its unintentional retrieval or caching by clients that use wildcard reads or otherwise routinely read all available attributes. It can be retrieved using the [NetworkPassphraseRequest](#networkpassphraserequest-command)
>
> command.

> This command is used to request the current WPA-Personal passphrase or PSK associated with the Wi-Fi network provided by this device.
>
> If the command is not executed via a CASE session, the command SHALL be rejected with a status of UNSUPPORTED_ACCESS.
>
> If no primary Wi-Fi network is available (the SSID attribute is null), the command SHALL be rejected with a status of INVALID_IN_STATE.
>
> Otherwise a NetworkPassphraseResponse SHALL be generated.

##### NetworkPassphraseResponse Command

> This command SHALL be generated in response to a NetworkPassphraseRequest command. The data for this command SHALL be as follows:

| **Name**   | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Conformance** |
|------------|----------|----------------|-----------------|
| Passphrase | octstr   | max 64         | M               |

1.  **Passphrase Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the current WPA-Personal passphrase or PSK associated with the primary Wi-Fi network provided by this device, in one of the following formats:

- 8..63 bytes: WPA/WPA2/WPA3 passphrase.

- 64 bytes: WPA/WPA2/WPA3 raw hex PSK. Each byte SHALL be a ASCII hexadecimal digit.

> This matches the formats defined for WPA networks by the Credentials field in the Network Com­ missioning cluster (see [\[MatterCore\]](#_bookmark8)).

##### NOTE

> WPA3-Personal permits passphrases shorter than 8 or longer than 63 characters, however the Network Commissioning cluster does not currently support configur­ ing Matter devices to connect to operational networks utilizing such a passphrase.

## Thread Border Router Management Cluster

> This cluster provides an interface for managing a Thread Border Router and the Thread network that it belongs to. Privileged nodes within the same fabric as a Thread Border Router can use these interfaces to request and set credentials information to the Thread network.

##### PANChange Feature

> This feature SHALL indicate the ability of the Border Router to change its already configured PAN to another, by setting a pending dataset.

##### NOTE

> This feature flag can be used to protect an already-configured network from acci­ dental configuration change, e.g. when the Thread Border Router serves non-Matter devices that do not support PAN change for an implementation-specific reason.

##### PreferredExtendedPanID Attribute

> This attribute SHALL represent the Thread Extended PAN ID value for the Thread network desig­ nated by the user to be their preferred network for commissioning of Thread devices. If not null, the value of this attribute SHALL match the ExtendedPanID of a network in the ThreadNetworks attribute. A write operation with a non-null value that does not match any network in the Thread­ Networks list SHALL be rejected with a status of CONSTRAINT_ERROR.
>
> The purpose of designating one Thread network as preferred is to help a commissioner to select a Thread network when a Thread device is within suitable range of more than one Thread network which appears in the ThreadNetworks list. A value of null indicates that there is no current pre­ ferred network: All networks MAY be treated as equally preferred by a commissioner with access to this cluster.
>
> This attribute MAY be automatically set to the ExtendedPanID of the first Thread network added to the ThreadNetworks list.
>
> A client SHALL obtain user consent before changing the value of this attribute from a non-null value.
>
> On a factory reset this attribute SHALL be reset to null.

##### ThreadNetworks Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the list of Thread Networks known about by this cluster. If the node hosting this cluster includes a Thread Border Router, then an entry for its Thread Network SHALL be included in this list.
>
> The list can be modified via the [AddNetwork](#addnetwork-command) and [RemoveNetwork](#removenetwork-command) commands.
>
> For each entry in the list, the cluster server also stores a Thread Operational Dataset. Clients use the [GetOperationalDataset](#getoperationaldataset-command) command to obtain the Operational Dataset for an entry in this list.
>
> On a factory reset this list SHALL be cleared, and any Thread Operational datasets previously stored SHALL be removed from the Node.

##### ThreadNetworkTableSize Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the maximum number of entries that can be held in the ThreadNet­ works list; it SHALL be at least 2 times the number of SupportedFabrics advertised in the Opera­ tional Credentials Cluster on the root endpoint of this node.

##### AddNetwork Command

> Adds an entry to the ThreadNetworks attribute with the specified Thread Operational Dataset.
>
> If there is an existing entry with the Extended PAN ID then the Thread Operational Dataset for that entry is replaced. As a result, changes to the network parameters (e.g. Channel, Network Name, PSKc, …) of an existing entry with a given Extended PAN ID can be made using this command.

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|:---|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **Opera­ tional­ Dataset** | octstr | max 254 |  |  | M |

1.  **OperationalDataset Field**

> This field SHALL represent the Operational Dataset for the network, using the encoding defined in the [Thread specification](#_bookmark27). It SHALL contain at least the following sub-TLVs: Active Timestamp, Chan­ nel, Channel Mask, Extended PAN ID, Network Key, Network Mesh-Local Prefix, Network Name, PAN ID, PSKc, and Security Policy.

2.  **Effect on Receipt**

    1.  If the TLV structure of the Operational Dataset is invalid, or if any of the required sub-TLVs are missing, the command SHALL be rejected with a status of CONSTRAINT_ERROR. However, inclu­ sion of unknown sub-TLVs SHALL NOT be treated as an error, as future versions of the Thread specification MAY define additional sub-TLVs.

    2.  If there is an existing ThreadNetworks entry with an Extended PAN ID matching the received dataset, then that entry SHALL be replaced with the received dataset. However, if the received dataset has an Active Timestamp that is less than or equal to that of the existing entry, then the update SHALL be rejected with a status of INVALID_IN_STATE.

    3.  Otherwise, a new entry SHALL be added based on the received dataset. If this would cause the size of the ThreadNetworks list to exceed the ThreadNetworkTableSize, then a RESOURCE_EX­ HAUSTED status SHALL be returned.

##### RemoveNetwork Command

> Removes the network with the given Extended PAN ID from the ThreadNetworks attribute.

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **Extended­ PanID** | octstr | 8 |  |  | M |

3.  **Effect on Receipt**

    1.  If no network with the given Extended PAN ID exists in the ThreadNetworks attribute, the com­ mand SHALL be rejected with a status of NOT_FOUND.

    2.  If the given Extended PAN ID matches the PreferredExtendedPanID attribute, the command SHALL be rejected with a status of CONSTRAINT_ERROR.

    3.  Otherwise, the network with the matching Extended PAN ID SHALL be removed from the ThreadNetworks attribute.

##### GetOperationalDataset Command

> Retrieves the Thread Operational Dataset with the given Extended PAN ID.

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **Extended­ PanID** | octstr | 8 |  |  | M |

4.  **Effect on Receipt**

    1.  If the command is not executed via a CASE session, the command SHALL be rejected with a sta­ tus of UNSUPPORTED_ACCESS.

    2.  If no network with the given Extended PAN ID exists in the ThreadNetworks attribute, the com­ mand SHALL be rejected with a status of NOT_FOUND.

    3.  Otherwise, an OperationalDatasetResponse command containing the operational dataset for the requested network SHALL be generated.

##### OperationalDatasetResponse Command

> Contains the Thread Operational Dataset for the Extended PAN specified in [GetOperationalDataset](#getoperationaldataset-command).

### Guidance for Fabrics / Commissioners

> This cluster allows fabrics (via their Administrators or Nodes with Manage privilege) to collabora­ tively share and manage a directory of [ThreadNetworks](#threadnetworks-attribute), as well as a designation of one of those
>
> networks as the user’s preferred network via the [PreferredExtendedPanID](#preferredextendedpanid-attribute) attribute.
>
> It is RECOMMENDED that fabrics only interact with instances of this cluster hosted on endpoints that declare a device type that explicitly allows this cluster; currently this includes the Network Infrastructure Manager and Thread Border Router device types. Networks from the ThreadNet­ works list of any such directory instance, as well as the Active Dataset made available by any Thread Border Router via the [Thread Border Router Management Cluster](#thread-border-router-management-cluster), SHOULD be considered as potentially available networks.
>
> In determining the user’s preferred network, a directory instance on a Network Infrastructure Manager device SHOULD take precedence over other instances. Where a fabric has access to multi­ ple Network Infrastructure Manager devices, it MAY give precedence to the directory instance on the Network Infrastructure Manager device considered to be acting as the primary Internet gate­ way device for the network.
>
> Due to the sensitive nature of Thread network credentials, it is RECOMMENDED that fabrics obtain user consent before starting to contribute credentials to a particular directory instance. Contribu­ tions to a directory instance SHOULD be restricted to those Thread networks that are likely to be reachable from the infrastructure network to which the device hosting that directory is connected.
