## Conventions

> The following conventions are used in this document.

### Enumerations and Reserved Values

> An undefined value or range of an enumeration, field, or identifier SHALL be considered reserved for future revisions of this standard and SHALL NOT be available for implementation. It is RECOM­ MENDED that a value stay undefined, rather than defining it as "reserved".
>
> A value or range of an enumeration, field, or identifier that is available for non-standard imple­ mentation SHALL be defined as manufacturer specific ("MS").
>
> A value or range of an enumeration, field, or identifier that is available for other parts of this stan­ dard SHALL be defined as such.
>
> A value or range of an enumeration, field, or identifier that is deprecated, and not available for implementation, SHALL be defined as deprecated ("D").

### Reserved Bit Fields

> An undefined bit or bit field SHALL be considered reserved for future revisions of this standard and SHALL NOT be available for implementation.
>
> It is RECOMMENDED that a bit stay undefined, rather than defining it as "reserved".
>
> An implementation of a revision where a bit is reserved SHALL indicate that bit as zero when con­ veying that bit in an interaction, and ignore that bit when conveyed from another implementation.

### Number Format

> In this specification, hexadecimal numbers are prefixed with the designation “0x” and binary num­ bers are prefixed with the designation “0b”. All other numbers are assumed to be decimal unless indicated otherwise within the associated text.
>
> When a hexadecimal number is longer than 4 nibbles, the underscore ("\_") character SHALL be used to separate the number into groups of 4 nibbles. If the number of nibbles is not evenly divisi­ ble by 4, the most significant group SHALL contain less than 4 nibbles and any lesser significant groups SHALL contain 4 nibbles.

[TABLE]

> Binary numbers are specified as successive groups of bits, and SHALL be separated by a space (“ “) or underscore ("\_") character at least every 4 bits from the most significant bit (next to the 0b prefix and leftmost on the page) to the least significant bit (rightmost on the page), e.g. the binary number 0b0000_1111 represents the decimal number 15 and hexadecimal 0x0F.
>
> Where individual bits are indicated (e.g. bit 3) the bit numbers are relative to the least significant bit which is bit 0.
>
> When a digit is specified as having any value in the range of that digit, it is specified with an “x” (this should not be confused with the "x" in the prefix "0x" for hexadecimal notation).

[TABLE]

> Bit ranges are always indicated starting with the most significant bit number. Therefore bits 7..4 are equivalent to the mask 0b1111_0000 or 0xF0.

### Provisional

> Per [\[CSA-PNP\]](#_bookmark92), when a specification is completed there may be sections of specification text (or smaller pieces of a section) that are not certifiable at this stage. These sections (or smaller pieces of a section) are marked as provisional prior to publishing the specification. This specification uses
>
> well-defined notation to mark [Provisional Conformance](#provisional-conformance) or notes a section of text with the term "provisional".

# Chapter 2. Architecture

## Overview

> Matter aims to build a universal IPv6-based communication protocol for smart home devices. The protocol defines the application layer that will be deployed on devices as well as the different link layers to help maintain interoperability. The following [diagram](#_bookmark100) illustrates the normal operational mode of the stack:

![](media/image3.png)

> *Figure 1. Application and Network Stack*

## Layered Architecture

> The architecture is divided into layers to help separate the different responsibilities and introduce a good level of encapsulation amongst the various pieces of the protocol stack. The vast majority of interactions flow through the stack captured in the following [Figure](#_bookmark102).
>
> ![](media/image4.png)
>
> *Figure 2. Layered Architecture*
>
> The *Application* layer corresponds to the high order business logic of a device. For example, an application that is focused on lighting might contain logic to handle turning on/off a light bulb, as well as its color characteristics.
>
> The *Data Model* layer corresponds to the data and verb elements that help support the functionality of the application. The Application operates on these data structures when there is intent to interact with the device.
>
> The *Interaction Model* layer defines a set of interactions that can be performed between a client and server device. For example, reading or writing attributes on a server device would correspond to application behavior on the device. These interactions operate on the elements defined at the data model layer.
>
> Once an action is constructed using the *Interaction Model*, it is serialized into a prescribed packed binary format to encode for network transmission. This process is handled in the *Action Framing* layer.
>
> An encoded action frame is then processed by the *Security Layer*: the message is encrypted and appended with a message authentication code. These actions ensure the data remain confidential and authentic between sender and receiver of the message.
>
> With an interaction now serialized, encrypted, and signed, the *Message Layer* constructs the pay­ load format with required and optional header fields, which specify properties of the message as well logical routing information.
>
> After the final payload has been constructed by the *Message Layer*, it is sent to the underlying trans­ port protocol (TCP or Matter’s [Message Reliability Protocol](#message-reliability-protocol-mrp)) for IP management of the data.
>
> Once the data is received on the peer device, it travels up the protocol stack, where the various lay­ ers reverse the operations on the data performed by the sender, to finally deliver the message to the Application for consumption.
>
> In addition to the data flows captured above, this specification defines secure session establishment protocols based on operational certificates (see [Section 4.14.2, “Certificate Authenticated Session](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case) [Establishment (CASE)”](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case)), or passcodes (see [Section 4.14.1, “Passcode-Authenticated Session Establish­](#passcode-authenticated-session-establishment-pase) [ment (PASE)”](#passcode-authenticated-session-establishment-pase)), group communication (see [Section 4.16, “Group Communication”](#group-communication)), a bulk data trans­ fer protocol ([BDX](#bulk-data-exchange-protocol-bdx)) suitable for sending bulk data between Nodes, and provisions for defining manu­ facturer-specific protocols.

## Network Topology

> In principle, any IPv6-bearing network is suitable for Matter deployment, subject to supporting a few core IPv6 standards. In this version of the specification, we focus on three link layer technolo­ gies: Ethernet, Wi-Fi and Thread. We restrict the specification to the above so that the specification can suitably cover provisioning of these link layers, and so that the amount of testing in certifica­ tion is suitably bounded.
>
> Matter treats networks as shared resources: it makes no stipulation of exclusive network owner­ ship or access. As a result, it is possible to overlay multiple Matter networks over the same set of constituent IP networks.
>
> This protocol may operate in the absence of globally routable IPv6 infrastructure. This requirement enables operation in a network disconnected or firewalled from the global Internet. It also enables deployment in situations where the Internet Service Provider either does not support IPv6 on con­ sumer premises or where the support proves otherwise limiting, for example, if the delegated pre­ fix cannot accommodate all the networks and devices on premises.
>
> This protocol supports local communications spanning one or more IPv6 subnets. Canonical net­ works supporting a fabric may include a Wi-Fi/Ethernet subnet, or one or more low power and lossy networks (LLN) subnets. In this version of the specification, Thread is the supported LLN stan­ dard.

### Single network

![](media/image5.png)

> *Figure 3. Single Thread network*
>
> ![](media/image6.png)
>
> *Figure 4. Single Wi-Fi network*
>
> In the single network topology, all Matter devices are connected to a single logical network. This could be a Thread/802.15.4 network, a Wi-Fi network or an Ethernet network. In the case of Wi- Fi/Ethernet, the network could in fact span multiple Wi-Fi and/or Ethernet segments provided that all the segments are bridged at the link layer. A Node is a single instance of a Matter device within a fabric, operationally available on an IP network.
>
> Each Node in the single-network topology communicates with every other Node in the Fabric via a single network interface.

### Star network topology

![](media/image7.png)

> *Figure 5. Star network topology*
>
> The star network topology consists of multiple peripheral networks joined together by a central hub network. The hub network will typically be the customer’s home network (Wi-Fi/Ethernet net­ work), while the peripheral networks can be of any supported network type. A peripheral network MUST always be joined directly to the hub network via one or more Border Routers.
>
> Architecturally, any number of peripheral networks may be present in a single Fabric, including multiple networks of the same type. Nodes MAY have interfaces onto any network (hub or periph­ eral), and MAY communicate directly to other Nodes on the same network. However, any communi­ cation that must cross a network boundary to reach its destination MUST flow through a Border Router.
>
> This protocol places a set of requirements on the Border Router. These requirements pertain to address assignment, route assignment and advertisement, multicast support, and discovery proxy­ ing.
>
> Note that in this version of the specification, Thread is the primary supported LLN. In many cases, customer installations will attempt to maintain a simple network topology, with a single Wi-Fi/Eth­ ernet subnet, and a single Thread network. However, more than one Thread network is possible and supported.
>
> To support home automation interoperability, this protocol supports the concept of [bridging](#introduction-4) which makes available, through a data model node, devices implementing other home automation tech­ nologies, transports and link layers.

## Scoped names

> The Matter protocol explicitly supports multiple administrators, unrelated by any common roots of trust (multi-admin). This functionality is addressed via [multiple fabrics](#chapter-12.-multiple-fabrics) and is enabled by the core aspects of name scoping (see below), and key considerations enabling multiple fabrics in [onboard­](#administrator-assisted-commissioning-flows) [ing](#administrator-assisted-commissioning-flows), [secure communication](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case), and aspects of the data model (such as [fabric-scoped data](#fabric-scoped-data)).
>
> A Fabric is a collection of Matter devices sharing a trusted root. The root of trust in Matter is the Root CA that issues the [NOCs](#introduction-2) which underpin node identities. Within the fabric, each node is uniquely identified by a stable Node ID. The scoped selection and allocation of these constructs within Matter ensures the uniqueness of identifiers and gives clear guidance on ownership and management of namespaces.
>
> The operational root of trust — the root certificate authority (CA) as identified by its public key (Root PK) — is responsible for the allocation of correctly scoped fabric identifiers. The security of all public key infrastructures (PKI) depends on the private key of the CA being protected and neither guessable nor obtainable; that property, in turn, implies that the public key is globally unique. Within any root CA, the fabrics — identified by a 64-bit number — are unique. The uniqueness mechanism emerges from the collaboration of the commissioner and the root CA associated with that particular commissioner. Matter wraps the collaboration between the commissioner and its associated root CA and other possible data stores into a concept called the "administrative domain manager" (ADM). The algorithmic details and policies within the administrative domain manager are out of the scope of the specification as long as the allocation of all identifiers obeys the unique­ ness and scoping criteria. Fabrics are uniquely identified by the tuple of their root CA’s public key and a Fabric ID. Similarly, within each fabric, the administrative domain manager is responsible for assigning a unique and stable Operational Node ID to every node.
>
> The scoping strategy as outlined here ensures that each scoped identifier can be allocated solely by the entities responsible for the scoping, without consideration for collisions or forgeries. For exam­ ple, two different CAs may allocate the same fabric identifiers and this would not create any prob­
>
> lems for the devices within the network. Scoped delegation of responsibility also provides for clear guidelines for the removal of specific identifiers.
>
> A Matter device may be a member of multiple fabrics and thus have multiple associated node IDs. The scoping strategy also naturally lends itself towards unambiguous resolution of names and cre­ dentials and places a clearly defined responsibility for managing the namespaces on each fabric’s associated administrative domain manager service.
>
> Prior to the first commissioning, such as in factory-reset state, a typical device contains no pre-allo­ cated operational roots of trust, and no operational identities in the form of fabric IDs and node IDs. Yet, various interactions expect the fabric ID, or a node ID. These identifiers emerge in a num­ ber of internal constructs — from address discovery, through identifying secure sessions, to evaluat­ ing access control privileges. In order to regularize all interactions with the device and solve the bootstrapping problem, a special primordial fabric ID is reserved, and associates a set of initial access control privileges with any communication that would be associated with the initial commis­ sioning sessions.

## Identifiers

### Fabric References and Fabric Identifier

> As described above, a Fabric ID is a 64-bit number that uniquely identifies the Fabric within the scope of a particular root CA. Conceptually, the fully qualified fabric reference consists of the tuple containing the public key of the root certificate authority, and the Fabric ID. Because the fully quali­ fied fabric reference is cumbersome to use, a number of mechanisms for compression of the refer­ ence are defined. The Fabric reference, in compressed form, is used during [operational discovery](#operational-discovery) to provide operational naming separation, a form of namespacing, between unrelated collections of devices.
>
> Fabric ID 0 is reserved across all fabric root public key scopes. This fabric ID SHALL NOT be used as the identifier of a fabric.
>
> A fabric is defined in the Data Model as a set of nodes that interact by accessing Data Model ele­ ments as defined in the Interaction Model (see [Section 7.5, “Fabric”](#fabric)).
>
> The layers below the data model, that convey data model interactions as messages, SHALL always indicate either the fabric associated with the message, or that there is no fabric associated with the message.
>
> For example: A Data Model message that is conveyed over a message channel that uses the reserved fabric ID '0' does not have a fabric associated with it.

### Vendor Identifier (Vendor ID, VID)

> A Vendor Identifier (Vendor ID or VID) is a 16-bit number that uniquely identifies a particular prod­ uct manufacturer, vendor, or group thereof. Each Vendor ID is statically allocated by the Connectiv­ ity Standards Alliance (see \[[CSA Manufacturer Code Database](#_bookmark12)\]).
>
> The following Vendor IDs are reserved:
>
> *Table 1. Vendor ID Allocations*

| **Range** | **Type** |
|----|----|
| 0x0000 | Matter Standard |
| 0x0001 - 0xFFF0 | reserved for individual Manufacturer Codes as per [CSA Manufacturer Code Database](#_bookmark12) |
| 0xFFF1 | Test Vendor \#1 |
| 0xFFF2 | Test Vendor \#2 |
| 0xFFF3 | Test Vendor \#3 |
| 0xFFF4 | Test Vendor \#4 |

> All other allocations of Vendor ID are specified in [CSA Manufacturer Code Database](#_bookmark12).

#### NOTE

> The *Test Vendor* IDs are reserved for test and development by device manufacturers or hobbyists. Commissioners SHOULD NOT commission devices using one of these VIDs onto an operational Fabric under normal operation unless the user is made fully aware of the security risks of providing an uncertified device with operational and networking credentials.

### Product Identifier (Product ID, PID)

> A Product Identifier (Product ID or PID) is a 16-bit number that uniquely identifies a product of a vendor. The Product ID is assigned by the vendor and SHALL be unique for each product within a [Vendor ID](#vendor-identifier-vendor-id-vid). Once a Product ID has been used, it SHALL NOT be reused by a different product type under the same Vendor ID. These Product IDs SHOULD NOT be specific to a unique physical device; rather they describe the product type, which might have many manufactured instances (e.g. multi­ ple colors of the same product type).
>
> A value of 0x0000 SHALL NOT be assigned to a product since Product ID = 0x0000 is used for these specific cases:

- To announce an anonymized Product ID as part of device discovery (see [Section 5.4.2,](#announcement-by-device) [“Announcement by Device”](#announcement-by-device)).

- To indicate an [OTA software update file](#_bookmark1682) applies to multiple Product IDs equally.

- To avoid confusion when presenting the [Onboarding Payload for ECM with multiple nodes](#presentation-of-onboarding-payload-for-ecm).

### Group Identifier (GID)

> A Group Identifier (Group ID or GID) is a 16-bit number that identifies a set of Nodes across a Fabric at the message layer (see [Section 4.17, “Group Key Management”](#group-key-management)). A Group ID can further be bound to one or more Endpoints within each Node in the group at the interaction layer.
>
> The Group ID space is allocated as described in [Table 2, “Group ID Allocations”](#_bookmark113):
>
> *Table 2. Group ID Allocations*

| **Range** | **Type** |
|----|----|
| 0xFF00 - 0xFFFF | Universal Group ID range reserved for static multi­ cast and anycast identifiers |
| 0x0001 - 0xFEFF | Application Group ID, assigned by fabric Administra­ tor |
| 0x0000 | Null or unspecified Group ID |

#### 2.5.4.1. Universal Group ID

> A Universal Group ID (UGID) is one that resides in the 16-bit subrange of Group ID that is reserved for groups that are common across this standard. These special multicast, groupcast, or anycast des­ tinations are constant and known to all Nodes on any Fabric. The Universal Group ID space is allo­ cated as described in [Table 3, “Universal Group ID Allocations”](#_bookmark114):
>
> *Table 3. Universal Group ID Allocations*

| **Range**     | **Type**                           |
|---------------|------------------------------------|
| 0xFFFF        | [All Nodes](#_bookmark115)         |
| 0xFFFE        | [All non-ICD Nodes](#_bookmark116) |
| 0xFFFD        | [All Proxies](#_bookmark117)       |
| 0xFF00-0xFFFC | Reserved for future use            |

> Because the keys and [IPv6 multicast prefixes](#ipv6-multicast-address) are different across Fabrics, Universal Groups only enable communication within a specific Fabric.
>
> **All Nodes Group**
>
> This group is used to message all Nodes in a Fabric.
>
> **All non-ICD Nodes Group**
>
> This group is used to message all power-capable Nodes in a Fabric. [ICD](#intermittently-connected-device-icd) Nodes SHALL NOT sub­ scribe to this group.
>
> **All Proxies Group**
>
> This group is used to discover Proxy Nodes during [Section 9.15.4, “Proxy Subscriptions”](#proxy-subscriptions).

### Node Identifier

> A Node Identifier (Node ID) is a 64-bit number that uniquely identifies an individual Node or a group of Nodes on a Fabric. The Node Identifier space is allocated as described in [Table 4, “Node](#_bookmark119) [Identifier Allocations”](#_bookmark119):
>
> *Table 4. Node Identifier Allocations*

| **Range**             | **Type**      |
|-----------------------|---------------|
| 0xFFFF_FFFF_FFFF_xxxx | Group Node ID |

| **Range**                                       | **Type**                |
|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| 0xFFFF_FFFF_0000_0000 to 0xFFFF_FFF­ F_FFFE_FFFF | Reserved for future use |
| 0xFFFF_FFFE_xxxx_xxxx                           | Temporary Local Node ID |
| 0xFFFF_FFFD_xxxx_xxxx                           | CASE Authenticated Tag  |
| 0xFFFF_FFFC_xxxx_xxxx to 0xFFFF_FF­ FC_FFFF_FFFF | Reserved for future use |
| 0xFFFF_FFFB_xxxx_xxxx                           | PAKE key identifiers    |
| 0xFFFF_FFF0_0000_0000 to 0xFFFF_FF­ FA_FFFF_FFFF | Reserved for future use |
| 0x0000_0000_0000_0001 to 0xFFFF_FFE­ F_FFFF_FFFF | Operational Node ID     |
| 0x0000_0000_0000_0000                           | Unspecified Node ID     |

> Node IDs are used for core messaging, within the internal APIs, within the data model, and to resolve the operational IPv6 addresses of Nodes (see [Section 4.3.2, “Operational Discovery”](#operational-discovery)).
>
> The span of Node IDs from 0xFFFF_FFF0_0000_0000 to 0xFFFF_FFFF_FFFF_FFFF, as well as the value 0x0000_0000_0000_0000 are both reserved for special uses.

#### Operational Node ID

> An Operational Node ID is a 64-bit number that uniquely identifies an individual Node on a Fabric. All messages must have an Operational Node ID as the source address. All unicast messages must have an Operational Node ID as the destination address.
>
> While source or destination address MAY be elided from a message, it MUST remain unambigu­ ously derivable from the [Session ID](#choosing-secure-unicast-session-identifiers).

#### Group Node ID

> A Group Node ID is a 64-bit Node ID that contains a particular [Group ID](#group-identifier-gid) in the lower half of the Node ID.

#### Temporary Local Node ID

> A Temporary Local Node ID is a 64-bit Node ID that contains an implementation-dependent value in its lower 32 bits. This allows implementations to keep track of connections or transport-layer links and similar housekeeping internal usage purposes in contexts where an Operational Node ID is unavailable.

#### PAKE key identifiers

> This subrange of Node ID is used to assign an access control subject to a particular PAKE key as specified in [Section 6.6.2.1.1, “PASE and Group Subjects”](#_bookmark646). An example usage would be to create an ACL entry to provide administrative access to any commissioner communicating via a PASE session
>
> established with a particular pincode.

#### CASE Authenticated Tag

> This subrange of Node ID is used to assign an access control subject to a group of peer nodes that share a single CASE session as specified in [Section 6.6.2.1.2, “Subjects identified by CASE Authenti­](#_bookmark647) [cated Tag”](#_bookmark647).

#### Unspecified Node ID

> The Unspecified Node ID (0x0000_0000_0000_0000) is a reserved value that never appears in mes­ sages or protocol usage. It exists to mark or detect the presence of uninitialized, missing, or invalid Node IDs.

### IPv6 Addressing

> This protocol uses IPv6 addressing for its operational communication. Node IDs and Fabric IDs are resolved to various types of IPv6 addresses \[[RFC 4291](#_bookmark51)\].

#### IPv6 Unicast Address

> An IPv6 Unicast Address is one that uniquely identifies and addresses a single Node on an IPv6 net­ work. A primary design goal for this standard is to allow Nodes to leverage native IPv6 technolo­ gies. As such, an operational IPv6 Unicast address that provides connectivity and routability between Nodes SHALL be used. This includes a global unicast address (GUA), a link-local address (LLA), or a unique local address (ULA).

#### IPv6 Multicast Address

> An IPv6 Multicast Address is formed using Unicast-Prefix-based IPv6 Multicast Addresses \[ [RFC 3306](#_bookmark46)\]:

- The first 12 bits are defined by \[[RFC 3306](#_bookmark46)\] and are 0xFF3.

- The next 4 bits are "scop" (scope) and set based on \[[RFC 7346](#_bookmark67)\] Section 2 to:

  - *Site-Local* (0x5) - spans all networks in the Fabric, including Thread, Ethernet, and Wi-Fi.

- The next 8 bits are reserved (0x00).

- The next 8 bits are "plen", and set to 0x40 to indicate a 64-bit long network prefix field.

> The network prefix portion of the Multicast Address is the 64-bit bitstring formed by concatenating:

- 0xFD to designate a locally assigned ULA prefix per \[[RFC 4193](#_bookmark50)\] Section 3.1

- The upper 56-bits of the Fabric ID for the network in big-endian order

> The 32-bit group identifier portion of the Multicast Address is the 32-bits formed by:

- The lower 8-bits of the Fabric ID

- 0x00

- The next 16-bits are the Group Identifier for the group, as specified in [Group Identifier](#group-identifier-gid) in big-

> endian order
>
> An example of the site local scoped multicast address for a given \<Fabric ID\> and \<Group ID\>:

[TABLE]

#### NOTE

> though *Site-Local* scope is always used, the effective scope MAY be limited by setting the IPv6 hop count.
>
> The Multicast Address formation ensures a low probability of a node receiving a multicast message it is not interested in. If a collision does occur on the multicast address (which requires two identi­ cal 64-bit Fabric IDs and two identical 16-bit Group IDs), processing of the message disambiguates which fabric and group is relevant by checking which operational group key leads to the message’s 64-bit MIC.

#### IPv6 Multicast Port Number

> The IANA assigned port number is 5540.

#### IPv4 Coexistence

> Matter devices SHALL be tolerant of IPv4 addresses and MAY ignore those addresses for the pur­ poses of Matter operations.

## Device identity

> Each Matter device holds a number of certificate chains.
>
> A Device Attestation Certificate (DAC) proves the authenticity of the manufacturer and a certifica­ tion status of the device’s hardware and software. The Device Attestation Certificate is used during the commissioning process by the Commissioner to ensure that only trustworthy devices are admit­ ted into a Fabric. The details of the device attestation process are captured in [Section 6.2, “Device](#device-attestation) [Attestation”](#device-attestation).
>
> Each Matter device is issued an [Operational Node ID](#operational-node-id) and a [Node Operational Certificate (NOC)](#node-operational-certificate-noc) for that Operational Node ID. The NOC enables a Node to identify itself within a Fabric by cryptographi­ cally binding a unique Node Operational Key Pair to the operational identity of its subject, attestable through the signature of a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). Operational Node IDs are removed on factory reset or removal of Fabrics. A NOC is issued during the commissioning process of a device into a Fabric. These steps help to protect the privacy of the end-user and to adapt to dif­ ferent trust models.
>
> The format of the Node Operational credentials and protocols for generating those credentials are detailed in [Section 6.4, “Node Operational Credentials Specification”](#node-operational-credentials-specification) and [Section 6.5, “Operational](#operational-certificate-encoding) [Certificate Encoding”](#operational-certificate-encoding) sections.

## Security

> Matter deploys modern security practices to protect the Fabric. Matter designates a core set of secu­ rity primitives detailed in [Chapter 3, *Cryptographic Primitives*](#chapter-3.-cryptographic-primitives) to provide comprehensive protection. Elliptic curve cryptography, based on the NIST P-256 curve (secp256r1) serves as the foundation for public key cryptography and digital signatures. Commonly available AES modes of operation have been selected to provide shared key cryptographic operations. In scenarios involving an out-of- band passcode-based authentication, Matter uses SPAKE2+, an efficient augmented PAKE algorithm.
>
> The core cryptographic primitives form the basis of a number of complementary secure protocols used within Matter. All unicast Node-to-Node messages are secured, authenticated, and provide replay protection. Building on top of IPv6 multicast, Matter also provides group messaging facilities, useful for efficiently addressing on an LLN. The group messaging features prioritize low latency of packet processing.

## Device Commissioning

> Device commissioning (see [Chapter 5, *Commissioning*](#chapter-5.-commissioning)) is the process of joining a device to a Fabric. The device being commissioned is referred to as the Commissionee and the device administering commissioning is referred to as the Commissioner. Device commissioning consists of the following steps:

1.  Device discovery (see [Section 5.4, “Device Discovery”](#device-discovery) and see [Section 5.1, “Onboarding Pay­](#onboarding-payload) [load”](#onboarding-payload)): The Commissioner discovers commissionable devices on network interfaces such as Bluetooth Low Energy, Wi-Fi, or other connected IP network. The Commissioner obtains the out- of-band secret ([Passcode](#passcode)) from the commissionable device’s [QR Code](#qr-code), [Manual Pairing Code](#manual-pairing-code), [NFC](#nfc-tag) [Tag](#nfc-tag) or other means. This secret is used by [Passcode-Authenticated Session Establishment (PASE)](#passcode-authenticated-session-establishment-pase) to establish a secure commissioning session. The order of discovering commissionable devices and obtaining the out-of-band secret from commissionable device is not critical.

2.  Security setup with PASE (see [Section 4.14.1, “Passcode-Authenticated Session Establishment](#passcode-authenticated-session-establishment-pase) [(PASE)”](#passcode-authenticated-session-establishment-pase)): Establish encryption keys between the Commissioner and Commissionee using PASE. All messages exchanged between the Commissioner and Commissionee are encrypted using these PASE-derived keys. The process also establishes an attestation challenge used during the [device attestation procedure](#device-attestation-procedure).

3.  Device attestation verification (see [Section 6.2, “Device Attestation”](#device-attestation)): Commissioner establishes the authenticity of the Commissionee as a certified device, notifying the user if the device is not certified.

4.  Information configuration (see [Section 6.4, “Node Operational Credentials Specification”](#node-operational-credentials-specification), [Sec­](#general-commissioning-cluster) [tion 11.10, “General Commissioning Cluster”](#general-commissioning-cluster) and [Section 11.18, “Node Operational Credentials](#node-operational-credentials-cluster) [Cluster”](#node-operational-credentials-cluster)): The Commissioner provides Commissionee with information such as regulatory domain, UTC time, Operational Certificate and network interfaces configuration.

5.  Join network (see [Section 11.9, “Network Commissioning Cluster”](#network-commissioning-cluster) and [Section 4.3.2, “Opera­](#operational-discovery) [tional Discovery”](#operational-discovery)): The Commissioner triggers the Commissionee to connect to the operational network unless the Commissionee is already on the operational network. The Node’s/Commis­ sionee’s IPv6 address is then either used (if already known) or discovered (if not known) by the Commissioner or Administrator.

6.  Security setup with CASE (see [Section 4.14.2, “Certificate Authenticated Session Establishment](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case) [(CASE)”](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case)): Derive encryption keys used to establish secure communication between the Commis­ sioner or Administrator and Node with CASE. All unicast messages between a Commissioner or Administrator and a Node are encrypted using these CASE-derived keys.

7.  Commissioning complete message exchange (see [Section 11.10, “General Commissioning Clus­](#general-commissioning-cluster) [ter”](#general-commissioning-cluster)): A message exchange encrypted using CASE-derived encryption keys on the operational network that indicates successful completion of commissioning process.

> A commissioner can reconfigure the Commissionee multiple times over the operational network after the commissioning is complete or over the commissioning channel after PASE-derived encryp­ tion keys are established during commissioning. The commissioning flows are described in [Section](#commissioning-flows) [5.5, “Commissioning Flows”](#commissioning-flows).

## Intermittently Connected Device (ICD)

> One goal of this standard is to provide support for communicating with devices that are intermit­ tently connected to the network or unreachable for periods of time. The Intermittently Connected Device operating mode behavior is specified in the [Section 9.16, “Intermittently Connected Devices](#intermittently-connected-devices-behavior) [Behavior”](#intermittently-connected-devices-behavior) section. The Intermittently Connected Device (ICD) operating mode is defined to help optimize network traffic, reachability, and power consumption for such nodes. Intermittent connec­ tions can be caused by a number of factors, including duty cycling to minimize power consumption, intermittent availability of network connectivity, device mobility, or intermittent availability of power.
>
> The ICD operating mode is designed to be agnostic to underlying network layer mechanisms and may be leveraged over any supported IP interfaces, including Thread and Wi-Fi.

#### NOTE

> Because clients and infrastructure devices may have limited buffering space to cache messages on behalf of intermittently connected devices, ICD communication patterns SHOULD be designed such that the ICD is predominantly the initiator.

### Sleepy End Device (SED)

> The Sleepy End Device (SED) operating mode is defined by the Thread standard to help extend and optimize battery lifetimes for Thread devices running on limited power sources such as batteries or limited energy scavenging. While the Matter ICD operating mode can leverage Thread Sleepy End Device (SED) behavior for Thread ICD devices, it SHOULD NOT be confused with it.

## Data Model Root

- Endpoint 0 (zero) SHALL be the [root node endpoint](#root-node-endpoint).

- Endpoint 0 (zero) SHALL support the Root Node device type.

## Stack Limits

### System Model Limits

#### Access Control Limits

- A node SHALL guarantee that there are at least four [Access Control Entries](#acl-attribute) available for every fabric supported by the node.

  - The node SHALL support at least four group table entries per fabric per endpoint having a Groups cluster instance.

  - Each Groups cluster instance SHALL support adding the endpoint to at least four groups.

#### Subscribe Interaction Limits

- A publisher SHALL ensure that every fabric the node is commissioned into can support at least three [Subscribe Interactions](#subscribe-interaction) to the publisher and that each subscription SHALL support at least 3 attribute/event paths.

- A server MAY permit [Subscribe Interactions](#subscribe-interaction) even when there is no accessing fabric, subject to available resources (e.g over PASE).

- Device type specifications MAY require a larger number of supported subscriptions or paths.

- SUBSCRIPTION_MAX_INTERVAL_PUBLISHER_LIMIT defines the upper limit for the publisher-selected maximum interval for any subscription.

  - If the publisher is an [ICD](#intermittently-connected-device-icd), this SHALL be set to the [Idle Mode Duration](#idlemodeduration-attribute).

  - If not, this SHALL be set to 60 minutes.

- The minimal supported capabilities, subject to the minimal constraints above, are reported in the CapabilityMinima attribute of the [Basic Information cluster](#basic-information-cluster).

#### Invoke Interaction Limits

- An [Invoke Request action](#invoke-request-action) MAY contain multiple [concrete command paths](#concrete-path), if supported by the server, but the total number of commands included in a single Invoke Request action is still lim­ ited by the maximum message size constraints.

## List of Provisional Items

# Chapter 3. Cryptographic Primitives

> This chapter introduces the various cryptographic primitives, algorithms and protocol building blocks used in this protocol. It introduces for each of them a functional abstraction that can be referred to in the other chapters of this specification. This chapter also maps those cryptographic primitives to specific instances with the corresponding appropriate informative or normative refer­ ences. Wherever relevant, it also gives necessary or relevant information about the use of these mappings in a specific context to achieve a compliant implementation.
>
> Given a [version](#_bookmark222) of the [Message Format](#message-frame-format), the cryptographic primitives are mapped to specific instances. There is no cryptosuite negotiation in this protocol: one [version](#_bookmark222) of the [Message Format](#message-frame-format) has one cryptosuite as defined in this chapter.
>
> Each section defines cryptographic primitives generically, together with concrete mappings to spe­ cific instances of these cryptographic primitives for [version 1.0](#_bookmark222) of the [Message Format](#message-frame-format). This chapter can also be used as guidance about which cryptographic primitives need to be supported by a device, but it must be noted that not all devices will have to support all of them. For example, a device may not require the Crypto_PBKDF() primitive, as values based on this operation could in some instances be precomputed and stored during the manufacturing process of the device. The proposed functional mapping in this chapter is normative with respect to the values computed by the functions but informative with respect to the way the functions are interfaced within imple­ mentations. For example, a function returning both a boolean to indicate success and a value if the operation is successful could also be implemented using exception mechanisms instead of return­ ing a boolean.
>
> It must also be noted that not all cryptographic primitives are exposed to the other parts of the specification. For example, the Crypto_TRNG() primitive SHALL NOT be called outside of the Crypto\_­ DRBG() implementation.
>
> The cryptographic primitives discussed below operate on data local to the host. Where more com­ plex data types are present and their external representation is applicable, the chapter notes the details of the encoding. Simple multi-byte data types without any additional context are assumed to be in host byte order when they are used internally to a procedure, unless otherwise stated.
>
> All octet strings are presented with first octet having index 0, and presented from left to right for indices 0 through N-1 for an octet string of length N.

## Deterministic Random Bit Generator (DRBG)

> This protocol relies on random numbers for many security purposes. For example, random num­ bers are used in generating secret keys, counters, cryptographic signature generation random secrets, etc. Those random numbers SHALL be generated using the Crypto_DRBG() function.

[TABLE]

## True Random Number Generator (TRNG)

> A TRNG (a.k.a. Entropy Source) is required to provide an entropy seed as an input to the DRBG algo­ rithm.

| **Mapping (Version 1.0)** |
|----|
| Crypto_TRNG() MAY be implemented according to the [NIST 800-90B](#_bookmark39) implementation guidelines but alternate implementations MAY be used. |

> In accordance with good security practices, the Crypto_TRNG() SHALL never be called directly but rather SHALL be used in the implementation of Crypto_DRBG().

## Hash function (Hash)

> Crypto_Hash() computes the cryptographic hash of a message.

[TABLE]

## Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC)

> Crypto_HMAC() computes the cryptographic keyed-hash message authentication code of a message.

## Public Key Cryptography

> Matter specifies the following scheme and parameters for public key cryptography.

### Group

> The public key cryptography of Matter relies on the group defined in the following mapping table.

[TABLE]

### Key generation

> Crypto_GenerateKeyPair() is the function to generate a key pair.

### Signature and verification

> Crypto_Sign() is used to sign a message, and Crypto_Verify() is used to verify a signature on a mes­ sage.
>
> These functions either generate or verify a signature of type Signature defined by the following mapping.

1.  **Signature**

2.  **Signature verification**

### ECDH

> Crypto_ECDH() is used to compute a shared secret from the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) pro­ tocol.

### Certificate validation

> Crypto_VerifyChain() is used to verify [Matter certificates](#operational-certificate-encoding).
>
> Crypto_VerifyChainDER() is used to verify public key [X.509 v3](#_bookmark84) certificates in [X.509 v3 DER](#_bookmark84) format.

[TABLE]

[TABLE]

> The primitives as described above verify cryptographic integrity of the certificate chains. This spec­ ification imposes a number of additional constraints on certificates discussed below in sections on [Device Attestation Certificates](#device-attestation-certificate-dac), [Node Operational Certificates](#operational-certificate-encoding) and [Certificate Common Conventions](#certificate-common-conventions).

### Time and date considerations for certificate path validation

> The Basic Path Validation algorithm in [RFC 5280](#_bookmark54) mandates the consideration of the "current time" against the validity period (notBefore, notAfter fields) when validating paths. The usage of "current time" assumes that such a time is available and correct, which is a strong assumption when consid­ ering some constrained devices or devices only locally reachable on a network in the absence of infrastructure to synchronize time against a global real-time reference.
>
> When the Crypto_VerifyChain primitive is used, rather than overriding the Basic Path Validation
>
> algorithm of [RFC 5280](#_bookmark54), Nodes SHALL consider the following definition of "current time" that accounts for the possible lack of a real time reference:

- If a Node has a current real-time clock value which is trusted according to implementation- defined means to be accurate with regard to global real-time, whether using [Time Synchroniza­](#time-synchronization-during-operation) [tion](#time-synchronization-during-operation) features of this specification or other means, then it SHALL use that time;

- Otherwise, the current time SHALL be set to the last-known-good UTC time.

> Upon failure to validate a certificate path, where the only reason for failure is an invalid validity period of a path element, a Node MAY apply a policy of its choice to determine whether to ignore this failure and still consider the path valid.

#### Last Known Good UTC Time

> Nodes SHALL maintain a stored Last Known Good UTC Time. This time is used as a fallback for cryptographic credentials expiry enforcement, if all other available time synchronization mecha­ nisms fail.
>
> The last known good UTC time SHALL be updated at commissioning and MAY be updated after a successful time synchronization, or by an embedded time in an OTA. Nodes SHOULD store a Last Known Good UTC Time value to persistent storage at least once a month. A Node’s initial out-of-box Last Known Good UTC time SHALL be the compile-time of the firmware.
>
> A Node MAY adjust the Last Known Good UTC Time backwards if it believes the current Last Known Good UTC Time is incorrect and it has a good time value from a trusted source. The Node SHOULD NOT adjust the Last Known Good UTC to a time before the later of:

- The build timestamp of its currently running software image

- The not-before timestamp of any of its operational certificates (see [Section 6.4.5, “Node Opera­](#node-operational-credentials-certificates) [tional Credentials Certificates”](#node-operational-credentials-certificates)).

> If a Node has used the Last Known Good UTC Time, it SHOULD recheck its security materials and existing connections if it later achieves time synchronization.

## Data Confidentiality and Integrity

> Symmetric block ciphers are used to provide message security.
>
> All unicast and multicast messages between Nodes requiring protection for confidentiality and integrity with data origin authentication SHALL use Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) as primitive to protect those messages.

# Chapter 4. Secure Channel

## General Description

> The Secure Channel and Message Layer provides a consistent networking service substrate to allow Nodes to communicate securely with one another.
>
> During commissioning and unicast communication, a [discovery](#discovery) mechanism is provided to deter­ mine peer IPv6 addresses and operational parameters. [Secure session establishment](#session-establishment) mechanisms are provided using either [certificates (CASE)](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case) or [shared passcodes (PASE)](#passcode-authenticated-session-establishment-pase).

### Messages

> Communication is performed using messages. Messages are either secured or unsecured.
>
> Each message has a [Session Type](#_bookmark230) and [Session ID](#session-id-16-bits) in order to identify whether it is secured and how it is to be decrypted and authenticated if it is. Each message has a [Message Counter](#message-counter-32-bits) field in order to uniquely identify the message for the purposes of security and duplicate detection.
>
> Operational communication is defined as traffic that uses the secured Matter message format between commissioned nodes over an IP transport. All operational communication has [message](#message-security) [security](#message-security) enabled. Operational communication between Nodes can be either unicast or multicast.
>
> Unsecured communication is strictly limited to:

- [Discovery](#discovery), which does not use the Matter message format.

- [User Directed Commissioning (UDC)](#message-format), which uses unsecured messages to initiate the commission­ ing process.

- [Session establishment](#session-establishment), which uses unsecured messages to establish a [CASE](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case) or [PASE](#passcode-authenticated-session-establishment-pase) session.

#### Message Types

> Messages are defined as either a *control message* or *data message*. Most messages are data mes­ sages. Control messages are reserved for internal protocols such as [MCSP](#message-counter-synchronization-protocol-mcsp) to initialize security. Both message types are identical in format, but use separate message counter domains so they can oper­ ate securely over the same security key.

#### Message Transports

> Messages are of [finite size](#message-size-requirements) and are sent as individual packets over the supported transports:

- UDP transports each message as a separate datagram. Messages support a basic reliability pro­ tocol called [MRP](#message-reliability-protocol-mrp) for use when the underlying transport (in this case UDP) doesn’t provide such features.

- TCP transports each message with a length prepended, performing segmentation and reassem­ bly as needed.

- [BTP](#bluetooth-transport-protocol-btp) transports each message over BLE as a separate SDU, performing segmentation and

> reassembly as needed.

- Wi-Fi Public Action Frame transports each message over Wi-Fi by encapsulating it into a Wi-Fi Public Action Frame as defined in Wi-Fi Alliance Unsynchronized Service Discovery ([WFA-USD](#_bookmark83)).

> [BTP](#bluetooth-transport-protocol-btp) is provided as a transport protocol for commissioning using a BLE interface. Wi-Fi Public Action Frame is provided as a transport protocol for commissioning using a Wi-Fi interface. TCP and [MRP (UDP with added reliability)](#message-reliability-protocol-mrp) are provided as transport protocols for operational messag­ ing.

#### Message Exchanges

> Messages provide an [Exchange Layer](#message-exchanges-1) to track related messages that make up small, discrete trans­ actions. The Exchange Layer provides this transaction tracking facility to the [Interaction Model](#chapter-8.-interaction-model-specification) [Layer](#chapter-8.-interaction-model-specification) above, providing a means to multiplex multiple such concurrent transactions over a given underlying session. The Exchange Layer also integrates the [Message Reliability Protocol (MRP)](#message-reliability-protocol-mrp) as a service for use over UDP transports. This Message Layer architecture is shown below in [Figure 6,](#_bookmark184) [“Message Layer Stack”](#_bookmark184):

## IPv6 Reachability

> This section describes IPv6 network configuration requirements to enable IPv6 reachability between Nodes. As described in [Section 2.3, “Network Topology”](#network-topology), a Matter network may be com­ posed of one or more IPv6 networks.
>
> In a single network configuration, all Matter Nodes are attached to the same IPv6 link. A single net­ work configuration may consist of a single bridged Wi-Fi / Ethernet network where all nodes attached to that network are part of the same broadcast domain. When all Matter Nodes are attached to the same Wi-Fi / Ethernet network, link-local IPv6 addressing is sufficient - no addi­ tional IPv6 network infrastructure is required.
>
> In a multiple network configuration, a Matter network is composed of (typically one) infrastructure network and one or more stub networks. Unlike an infrastructure network, stub networks do not serve as transit networks. Typically, the infrastructure network is a bridged Wi-Fi / Ethernet net­
>
> work and the Thread networks are stub networks. A stub router connects a stub network to an infrastructure network and provides IPv6 reachability between the two networks.

### Stub Router Behavior

> A stub router SHALL implement \[[draft-lemon-stub-networks](#_bookmark75)\]. In a multiple network configuration, both the infrastructure and stub networks require routable IPv6 addresses to communicate across networks. A routable IPv6 address SHALL have global scope (e.g. GUA or ULA) \[[RFC 4007](#_bookmark48)\] and SHALL be constructed out of a prefix advertised as on-link. If there is no routable prefix on a given network, the stub router SHALL provide its own routable prefix. Note that Thread’s "on-mesh pre­ fix" is equivalent to Wi-Fi / Ethernet’s "on-link prefix".
>
> Stub routers SHALL advertise reachability to all routable prefixes on the adjacent network. A stub router connecting a Thread network SHALL advertise reachability to all of the Thread network’s routable prefixes to the adjacent infrastructure network using Route Information Options \[[RFC 4191](#_bookmark49)\] contained in Router Advertisements \[[RFC 4861](#_bookmark53)\]. That same stub router SHALL also advertise reachability to all of the infrastructure network’s routable prefixes to the adjacent Thread network in the Thread Network Data \[[Thread specification](#_bookmark81)\].

### Matter Node Behavior

> Matter Nodes SHALL configure a link-local IPv6 address. In addition, Nodes SHALL support configu­ ration of at least three routable IPv6 addresses (in addition to the link-local and, in the case of Thread, mesh-local addresses). On a Wi-Fi / Ethernet interface, ICMPv6 Router Advertisement (RA) messages advertise prefixes for use on the link \[[RFC 4861](#_bookmark53)\]. On a Thread interface, the Thread Net­ work Data contains prefixes for use on the link \[[Thread specification](#_bookmark81)\]. If a Node receives an on-link prefix that allows autonomous configuration on a given interface and the Node has fewer than three routable IPv6 addresses configured, the Node SHALL autonomously configure an IPv6 address out of that prefix.
>
> Matter Nodes SHALL also configure routes to adjacent networks. On Wi-Fi / Ethernet networks, Nodes SHALL process Route Information Options \[[RFC 4191](#_bookmark49)\] and configure routes to IPv6 prefixes assigned to stub networks via stub routers. Wi-Fi / Ethernet interfaces SHALL support maintaining at least 16 different routes configured using Route Information Options. On Thread networks, Nodes SHALL route according to routing information provided in the Thread Network Data \[[Thread](#_bookmark81) [specification](#_bookmark81)\]. Thread devices SHALL support as many routes as can be encoded in the Thread Net­ work Data.
>
> Matter Nodes SHALL support a number of IPv6 neighbor cache entries at least as large as the [num­](#minimal-number-of-case-sessions) [ber of supported CASE sessions](#minimal-number-of-case-sessions) plus the number of supported routes.

## Discovery

> This section describes Service Advertising and Discovery for Matter.
>
> Service Advertising and Discovery is used within Matter in the following contexts:

- Commissionable Node Discovery

&nbsp;

- Operational Discovery

- Commissioner Discovery

- User Directed Commissioning

> Service Advertising and Discovery for Matter uses IETF Standard DNS-Based Service Discovery (DNS‑SD) \[[RFC 6763](#_bookmark63)\]. Matter requires no modifications to IETF Standard DNS‑SD.
>
> Using DNS‑SD means that both the unicast IPv6 address and port of the offered service are discov­ ered, freeing Matter from requiring a single preallocated fixed port. This also makes it possible to run multiple instances of Matter software on a single device, because each instance has its own dynamically allocated port, instead of conflicting over attempting to use the same preallocated fixed port.
>
> On Wi‑Fi and Ethernet networks today, DNS‑SD \[[RFC 6763](#_bookmark63)\] uses Multicast DNS \[[RFC 6762](#_bookmark62)\] for zero- configuration operation.
>
> Since Matter protocols must support IPv6 at a minimum, Matter software discovering other Matter instances SHALL process DNS AAAA (IPv6 address) records, but also MAY process DNS A (IPv4 address) records.
>
> Because of this, where feasible in the underlying service discovery API, Matter software advertising the availability of a service SHOULD indicate that announcements and answers for this service need include only IPv6 address records, not IPv4 address records. On a general-purpose dual-stack host that supports both IPv4 and IPv6, this can be achieved by having Matter-related SRV records reference a Matter-specific target hostname that has only IPv6 address records attached. This allows a general-purpose dual-stack host to offer discoverable IPv4 addresses for legacy client soft­ ware that still requires IPv4, while offering optimized IPv6-only address discovery for Matter pur­ poses.
>
> Similarly, since Matter does not use IPv4, Matter software discovering other Matter instances SHOULD NOT expect any IPv4 addresses included in responses.
>
> These two items address the *content* of service discovery messages. When using Multicast DNS simi­ lar efficiency questions arise related to the *delivery* of those service discovery messages, sent over IPv4, IPv6, or both.
>
> Where supported in the underlying service discovery API, Matter software using Multicast DNS to advertise the availability of a service SHOULD indicate that announcements and answers for this service need only be performed over IPv6.
>
> Similarly, where supported in the underlying service discovery API, Matter application software using Multicast DNS to issue service discovery queries SHOULD indicate that these queries need only be performed over IPv6.
>
> These optimizations reduce both the size and the number of multicast packets, which is particularly beneficial on Wi‑Fi networks. A Matter device that only supports IPv6 gets these optimizations auto­ matically, simply by virtue of not supporting IPv4 at all.
>
> For Thread mesh networks, where excessive use of multicast would be detrimental \[[RFC 7558](#_bookmark69)\],
>
> DNS‑SD uses Unicast DNS instead, leveraging capabilities of the Thread Service Registry on the Thread Border Router \[[draft-lemon-stub-networks](#_bookmark75)\].
>
> Conceptually, the DNS‑SD \[[RFC 6763](#_bookmark63)\] information being communicated is identical to when Multi­ cast DNS \[[RFC 6762](#_bookmark62)\] is being used, except that the information is communicated in unicast packets to and from a designated Service Registry, rather than being communicated in multicast packets to and from every other Node in the same broadcast domain.
>
> Using Service Registration Protocol \[[SRP](#_bookmark80)\] and an Advertising Proxy \[[AdProx](#_bookmark17)\] running on the Thread Border Router, Matter Nodes on a Thread mesh can be discovered by other Matter Nodes on an adjacent Ethernet or Wi‑Fi link, without the cost of using multicast on the Thread mesh. All Thread- connected Matter Nodes SHALL implement Service Registration Protocol.
>
> Thread Border Routers advertise available SRP servers in the Thread Network Data \[[Thread specifi­](#_bookmark81) [cation](#_bookmark81)\]. Thread devices SHALL register their services using an available SRP server \[[Thread specifi­](#_bookmark81) [cation](#_bookmark81)\].
>
> When Matter Nodes issue short-lived requests to other Matter Nodes, the response is sent back to the source IPv6 address and port of the request. When Matter Nodes issue long-lived requests to other Matter Nodes, by the time the response is generated the requester may have changed IPv6 address or port, so the responder may have to discover the current IPv6 address and port of the ini­ tiator in order to send the response.
>
> A Thread Border Router SHALL implement DNS‑SD Discovery Proxy \[[RFC 8766](#_bookmark73)\] to enable clients on the Thread mesh (e.g., other Nodes) to discover services (e.g., Matter Nodes) advertised using Multi­ cast DNS on an adjacent Ethernet or Wi‑Fi link, also without the cost of using multicast on the Thread mesh \[[draft-lemon-stub-networks](#_bookmark75)\]. For short-lived instantaneous queries, these queries can be performed using unicast DNS over UDP to the DNS‑SD Discovery Proxy. For long-lived queries with ongoing change notification, DNS Push Notifications \[[RFC 8765](#_bookmark72)\] with DNS Stateful Operations \[[RFC 8490](#_bookmark71)\] allows clients on the Thread mesh to be notified of changes to the set of discovered ser­ vices without expensive polling.
>
> In principle, the Thread mesh Service Registry can be run on any capable Node(s) within (or even outside) the Thread mesh, though in practice the Thread Border Router is an attractive candidate to offer the Service Registry. Thread Border Router devices are typically AC-powered, and typically have more capable CPUs with greater flash storage and RAM than more constrained battery-pow­ ered Thread Nodes. Matter devices on Thread are dependent on Thread providing reliable service for those Thread devices on the Thread mesh. This is similar to how Matter devices on Wi‑Fi are dependent on the Wi‑Fi access point (AP) providing reliable service for those Wi‑Fi devices using that Wi‑Fi access point.

### Commissionable Node Discovery

> The Matter protocol family supports UDP and TCP for Matter commissioning of Commissionees already on the customer’s IP network (such as Ethernet-connected Nodes, or Wi‑Fi Nodes already associated to the Wi‑Fi network via other means).
>
> For these Commissionees, Matter Commissionable Node Discovery is performed using IETF Stan­ dard DNS-Based Service Discovery (DNS‑SD) \[[RFC 6763](#_bookmark63)\] as described below.
>
> For Matter Commissionable Node Discovery in the *already-on-network* case, the DNS‑SD instance name SHALL be a dynamic, pseudo-randomly selected, 64-bit temporary unique identifier, expressed as a fixed-length sixteen-character hexadecimal string, encoded as ASCII (UTF-8) text using capital letters, e.g., DD200C20D25AE5F7. A new instance name SHALL be selected when the Node boots. A new instance name SHALL be selected whenever the Node enters Commissioning mode. A new instance name MAY be selected at other times, as long as the instance name does not change while the Node is in commissioning mode.
>
> A commissionable Node that is already connected to an IP-bearing network SHALL only make itself discoverable on the IP network and SHALL use the relevant DNS-SD service (\_matterc.\_udp) described below.
>
> If a Node is connected to multiple IP-bearing networks, and it receives either the [OpenCommission­](#opencommissioningwindow-command) [ingWindow](#opencommissioningwindow-command) or the [OpenBasicCommissioningWindow](#openbasiccommissioningwindow-command) command, it MAY make itself discoverable only on the network on which the command was received. Otherwise, a commissionable Node that is connected to multiple IP-bearing networks SHALL make itself discoverable on all of its connected IP-bearing networks.
>
> The Matter Commissionable Node Discovery DNS‑SD instance name SHALL be unique within the namespace of the local network (the .local link-local namespace of the Ethernet and Wi‑Fi links \[[RFC 6762](#_bookmark62)\], or the unicast domain selected by the Thread Border Router for devices on the Thread mesh).
>
> In the rare event of a collision in the selection of the 64-bit temporary unique identifier, the existing DNS‑SD name conflict detection mechanism will detect this collision, and a new pseudo-randomly selected 64-bit temporary unique identifier SHALL be generated by the Matter Commissionee that is preparing for commissioning. Name conflict detection is described in Section 9 ("Conflict Resolu­ tion") of the Multicast DNS specification \[[RFC 6762](#_bookmark62)\] and Section 2.4.3.1 ("Validation of Adds") of the Service Registration Protocol specification \[[SRP](#_bookmark80)\].
>
> The DNS‑SD service type \[[RFC 6335](#_bookmark60)\] for Matter Commissionable Node Discovery is \_matterc.\_udp.
>
> For link-local Multicast DNS the service domain SHALL be local. For Unicast DNS such as used on Thread the service domain SHALL be as configured automatically by the Thread Border Router.

#### Host Name Construction

> For DNS‑SD a target host name is required, in addition to the instance name. The target host name SHALL be constructed using one of the available link-layer addresses, such as a 48-bit device MAC address (for Ethernet and Wi‑Fi) or a 64-bit MAC Extended Address (for Thread) expressed as a fixed-length twelve-character (or sixteen-character) hexadecimal string, encoded as ASCII (UTF-8) text using capital letters, e.g., B75AFB458ECD.\<domain\>. In the event that a device performs MAC address randomization for privacy, then the target host name SHALL use the privacy-preserving randomized version and the hostname SHALL be updated in the record every time the underlying link-layer address rotates. Note that it is legal to reuse the same hostname on more than one inter­ face, even if the underlying link-layer address does not match the hostname on that interface, since the goal of using a link-layer address is to ensure local uniqueness of the generated hostname. If future link layers are supported by Matter that do not use 48-bit MAC addresses or 64-bit MAC Extended Address identifiers, then a similar rule will be defined for those technologies.

#### Extended Discovery

> A Matter Commissionee that advertises Commissionable Node Discovery service records is not nec­ essarily in a state that will allow Commissioning (this state is referred to below as "in Commission­ ing Mode"). While [Section 5.4.2.3, “Announcement Duration”](#announcement-duration) is limited for some forms of device advertisement, a Matter device MAY advertise Matter Commissionable Node Discovery service records for longer periods, possibly permanently. Advertising Commissionable Node Discovery when not in Commissioning Mode is referred to here as Extended Discovery. Extended Discovery is allowed only for DNS-SD advertisements and not for the other forms of [Device Discovery](#device-discovery) such as [BLE Commissioning Discovery](#using-ble).
>
> To protect customer privacy on public networks, a Matter Commissionee SHALL provide a way for the customer to set a timeout on Extended Discovery, or otherwise disable Extended Discovery. The default behavior for Commissionable Node Discovery SHOULD default to limiting announcement as defined in [Section 5.4.2.3, “Announcement Duration”](#announcement-duration) unless the Manufacturer wishes to enable longer periods for specific use cases.

#### Commissioning Subtypes

> The following subtypes for Matter Commissionable Node Discovery are defined:

1.  \_L\<dddd\>, where \<dddd\> provides the full 12-bit [discriminator](#discriminator-value), encoded as a variable-length deci­ mal number in ASCII text, omitting any leading zeroes.

2.  \_S\<dd\>, where \<dd\> provides the upper 4 bits of the [discriminator](#discriminator-value), encoded as a variable-length decimal number in ASCII text, omitting any leading zeroes.

3.  \_V\<ddddd\>, where \<ddddd\> provides the 16-bit [Vendor ID](#vendor-identifier-vendor-id-vid), encoded as a variable-length decimal number in ASCII text, omitting any leading zeroes.

4.  \_T\<ddd\>, where \<ddd\> provides the [device type](#device-type) identifier for the device, encoded as a variable- length decimal number in ASCII (UTF-8) text, omitting any leading zeroes. In case the device combines multiple device types, the manufacturer SHOULD choose the device type identifier of the primary function of the device for which the device wishes to be discoverable.

5.  \_CM, which represents "currently in Commissioning Mode" (due to any method, for example, a factory new device that has just been put into commissioning mode by the user, or an already- commissioned device which has just received the [Open Commissioning Window](#opencommissioningwindow-command) command).

> The *long discriminator* subtype (e.g., \_L840) enables filtering of results to find only Commissionees that match the full discriminator code, as provided in the [onboarding payload](#_bookmark472).
>
> The *short discriminator* subtype (e.g., \_S3) enables filtering of results to find only Commissionees that match the upper 4 bits of the discriminator code, as provided in the [manual pairing code](#manual-pairing-code).
>
> The optional *Vendor ID* subtype (e.g., \_V123) enables a vendor-specific app to achieve filtering of results to find only Nodes that match that Vendor ID.
>
> The *Commissioning Mode* subtype (e.g., \_CM) enables filtering of results to find only Nodes that are currently in Commissioning Mode. Note that the subtype is \_CM regardless of whether the TXT record for commissioning mode is set to 1 (CM=1) or 2 (CM=2). A Commissionee that is not in commis­ sioning mode (CM=0) SHALL NOT publish this subtype.
>
> The optional *device type* subtype (e.g., \_T10) enables filtering of results to find only Nodes that match the device type, generally used for the [User-Initiated Beacon Detection, Not Yet Commissioned](#user-initiated-beacon-detection-not-yet-commissioned-device) [Device](#user-initiated-beacon-detection-not-yet-commissioned-device) and the [User-Initiated Beacon Detection, Already Commissioned Device](#user-initiated-beacon-detection-already-commissioned-device) use cases.
>
> In the event that a vendor-specific app wishes to show the user only some of that vendor’s Commis­ sionees awaiting commissioning but not all of them, any desired filtering logic (based upon arbi­ trary criteria, not only Product ID) MAY be implemented within that vendor’s proprietary commis­ sioning app.

#### TXT Records

> After discovery, IPv6 addresses are returned in the AAAA records and key/value pairs are returned in the DNS‑SD TXT record.
>
> Nodes SHALL publish AAAA records for all available IPv6 addresses upon which they are willing to accept Matter commissioning messages.
>
> TXT records available for Commissionable Node Discovery include the common TXT record key/value pairs defined in [Section 4.3.4, “Common TXT Key/Value Pairs”](#common-txt-keyvalue-pairs).
>
> Commissioners SHALL silently ignore TXT record keys that they do not recognize. This is to facili­ tate future evolution of this specification without breaking backwards compatibility with existing Commissioners that do not implement the new functionality.
>
> The following subsections describe key/value pairs that are defined specifically for Commissionable Node discovery.

#### TXT key for discriminator (D)

> The key D SHALL provide the full 12-bit [discriminator](#discriminator-value) for the Commissionable Node and SHALL be present in the DNS-SD TXT record.
>
> The discriminator value SHALL be encoded as a variable-length decimal number in ASCII text, with up to four digits, omitting any leading zeroes.
>
> Any key D with a value mismatching the aforementioned format SHALL be silently ignored.
>
> As an example, value D=840 would indicate that this Commissionable Node has decimal long dis­ criminator 840. When needed, the upper 4 bits of the discriminator provided by the [manual pairing](#manual-pairing-code) [code](#manual-pairing-code) can be algorithmically derived from the full discriminator.

#### TXT key for Vendor ID and Product ID (VP)

> The optional key VP, if present, MAY provide [Vendor ID](#vendor-identifier-vendor-id-vid) and [Product ID](#product-identifier-product-id-pid) information of the device. A vendor MAY choose not to include it at all, for privacy reasons.
>
> If the VP key is present then it MAY take two forms:

6.  VP=123 gives Vendor ID

7.  VP=123+456 gives Vendor ID + Product ID

> The Vendor ID and Product ID SHALL both be expressed as variable-length decimal numbers, encoded as ASCII text, omitting any leading zeroes, and of maximum length of 5 characters each to fit their 16-bit numerical range.
>
> If the Product ID is present, it SHALL be separated from the Vendor ID using a ‘+’ character.
>
> If the VP key is present without a Product ID, the value SHALL contain only the Vendor ID alone, with no ‘+’ character.
>
> If the VP key is present, the value SHALL contain at least the Vendor ID. If the VP key is present, it SHALL NOT have a missing or empty value.

#### TXT key for commissioning mode (CM)

> The key CM (Commissioning Mode) SHALL indicate whether or not the publisher of the record is cur­ rently in Commissioning Mode and available for immediate commissioning. When in commission­ ing mode, the value associated with the CM key indicates the source of the passcode.
>
> Four situations are legal:

8.  The absence of key CM SHALL imply a value of 0 (CM=0).

9.  The key/value pair CM=0 SHALL indicate that the publisher is not currently in Commissioning Mode.

10. The key/value pair CM=1 SHALL indicate that the publisher is currently in Commissioning Mode and requires use of a passcode for commissioning provided by the Commissionee (e.g., printed on a label or displayed on screen), such as when the device is in a factory-new state or when the [Open Basic Commissioning Window](#openbasiccommissioningwindow-command) command has been used to enter commissioning mode.

11. The key/value pair CM=2 SHALL indicate that the publisher is currently in Commissioning Mode and requires use of a dynamically generated passcode for commissioning corresponding to the verifier that was passed to the device using the [Open Commissioning Window](#opencommissioningwindow-command) command.

> A key value of 2 MAY be used to disambiguate collisions of discriminators between uncommis­ sioned Nodes and commissioned Nodes announcing after a commissioning window was opened. A key value of 2 serves as a hint to Commissioners to possibly expect multiple Nodes with the same discriminator (see [Commissioning Discriminator](#txt-key-for-discriminator-d)), and to instruct the user to enter the Onboarding Payload [presented](#presentation-of-onboarding-payload-for-ecm) by another Administrator rather than a code provided by the Commissionee.
>
> Since [Extended Discovery](#extended-discovery) can be disabled by the customer, a key value of 0 may not ever be returned by a publisher. When Extended Discovery is disabled and the publisher is not in commis­ sioning mode, then the publisher will not respond to Commissionable Node Discovery.

#### TXT key for device type (DT)

> The optional key DT MAY be used to provide the publisher’s [Primary Device Type](#primary-device-type). If present, it SHALL be encoded as a variable-length decimal number in ASCII text, omitting any leading zeroes.
>
> For example, the DT=10 key/value pair would indicate that the primary device type is 10 (0x000A), which is the device type identifier for a Door Lock.

#### TXT key for device name (DN)

> The optional key DN MAY provide a device advertisement name. If present, it SHALL be encoded as a valid UTF-8 string with a maximum length of 32 bytes (matching the maximum length of the Node­ Label string in the [Basic Information Cluster](#basic-information-cluster)).
>
> When provided, the source of this value SHALL be editable by the user with use clearly designated as being for on-network advertising and MAY be the value stored in the NodeLabel attribute of the [Basic Information Cluster](#basic-information-cluster)) of the Node.
>
> To protect customer privacy on public networks, if a Commissionee supports this key/value pair, then the Commissionee SHALL provide a way for the customer to disable its inclusion.
>
> A Commissionee SHOULD NOT include this field unless doing so for specific use cases which call for it.
>
> For example, the DN=Living Room key/value pair indicates that the advertisement name specified by the user is 'Living Room'.

#### TXT key for rotating device identifier (RI)

> The optional key RI MAY provide a [Rotating Device Identifier](#_bookmark520).
>
> If present, the value associated with the RI key SHALL contain the octets of the Rotating Device Identifier octet string encoded as the concatenation of each octet’s value as a 2-digit uppercase hexadecimal number.
>
> The resulting ASCII string SHALL NOT be longer than 100 characters, which implies a Rotating Device Identifier of at most 50 octets.

#### TXT key for pairing hint (PH)

> The optional key PH MAY provide a *pairing hint*.
>
> If present, it SHALL be encoded as a variable-length decimal number in ASCII text, omitting any leading zeroes.
>
> The pairing hint represents a base-10 numeric value for a bitmap of methods supported by the Commissionee in its current state for putting it in Commissioning Mode.
>
> For example, the PH=5 key/value pair represents a hint value with bits 0 and 2 are set. This value MAY change during the lifecycle of the device.
>
> For example, a device may have a value with bit 0 (Power Cycle) set and bit 2 (Administrator app) unset when in a factory reset state, and then have a value with bit 0 unset and bit 2 set after it has been Commissioned.
>
> The bitmap of methods is defined in [Table 5, “Pairing Hint Values”](#_bookmark201).
>
> If the Commissionee has enabled [Extended Discovery](#extended-discovery), then it SHALL include the key/value pair for
>
> PH in the DNS‑SD TXT record when not in Commissioning Mode (CM=0).
>
> This key/value pair MAY be returned when in Commissioning Mode (CM=1).
>
> If the Commissioner does not recognize this value, for example, if the value indicates bit indices defined in a newer version of this specification than the version which the Commissioner imple­ ments, then the Commissioner MAY utilize the bits that it does understand and MAY utilize addi­ tional data sets available for assisting the user. For example, when a Vendor ID and Product ID are available to the Commissioner, the [Section 11.23, “Distributed Compliance Ledger”](#distributed-compliance-ledger) may also pro­ vide a URL for the Device User Guide which can contain additional information to help in Commis­ sioning this Commissionee.
>
> Some of the pairing hints MAY require additional information to be encoded for proper expression of their meaning. This is accomplished with the [PI](#txt-key-for-pairing-instructions-pi) TXT key, described in a following section. Depen­ dency on usage of the PI key is expressed by the PI Dependency column in the table below.
>
> The following fields in the bitmap are defined for values of the PH key:
>
> *Table 5. Pairing Hint Values*

| **Bit index** | **Name** | **PI Dependency** | **Description** |
|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | Power Cycle | False | The Device will auto­ matically enter Com­ missioning Mode upon power cycle (unplug/re- plug, remove/re-insert batteries). This bit SHALL be set to 1 for devices using [Standard](#standard-commissioning-flow) [Commissioning Flow](#standard-commissioning-flow), and set to 0 otherwise. |
| 1 | Device Manufacturer URL | False | This SHALL be set to 1 for devices requiring [Custom Commissioning](#custom-commissioning-flow) [Flow](#custom-commissioning-flow) before they can be available for Com­ missioning by any Com­ missioner. For such a flow, the user SHOULD be sent to the URL spec­ ified in the [Commission­](#commissioningcustomflowurl) [ingCustomFlowUrl](#commissioningcustomflowurl) of the [DeviceModel schema](#devicemodel-schema) entry indexed by the Vendor ID and Product ID (*e.g.*, as found in the announcement) in the [Distributed Compliance](#distributed-compliance-ledger) [Ledger](#distributed-compliance-ledger). |

[TABLE]

| **Bit index** | **Name** | **PI Dependency** | **Description** |
|----|----|----|----|
| 7 | Press Reset Button with application of power | False | The Device will enter Commissioning Mode when reset button is pressed when applying power to it. |
| 8 | Press Reset Button for N seconds | True | The Device will enter Commissioning Mode when reset button is pressed for N seconds. The exact value of N SHALL be made avail­ able via PI key. |
| 9 | Press Reset Button until light blinks | True | The Device will enter Commissioning Mode when reset button is pressed until associated light blinks. Informa­ tion on color of light MAY be made available via PI key (see Note 1). |
| 10 | Press Reset Button for N seconds with applica­ tion of power | True | The Device will enter Commissioning Mode when reset button is pressed for N seconds when applying power to it. The exact value of N SHALL be made available via PI key. |
| 11 | Press Reset Button until light blinks with appli­ cation of power | True | The Device will enter Commissioning Mode when reset button is pressed until associated light blinks when applying power to the Device. Information on color of light MAY be made available via PI key (see Note 1). |

| **Bit index** | **Name** | **PI Dependency** | **Description** |
|----|----|----|----|
| 12 | Press Reset Button N times | True | The Device will enter Commissioning Mode when reset button is pressed N times with maximum 1 second between each press. The exact value of N SHALL be made avail­ able via PI key. |
| 13 | Press Setup Button | False | The Device will enter Commissioning Mode when setup button is pressed. |
| 14 | Press Setup Button with application of power | False | The Device will enter Commissioning Mode when setup button is pressed when applying power to it. |
| 15 | Press Setup Button for N seconds | True | The Device will enter Commissioning Mode when setup button is pressed for N seconds. The exact value of N SHALL be made avail­ able via PI key. |
| 16 | Press Setup Button until light blinks | True | The Device will enter Commissioning Mode when setup button is pressed until associated light blinks. Informa­ tion on color of light MAY be made available via PI key (see Note 1). |
| 17 | Press Setup Button for N seconds with applica­ tion of power | True | The Device will enter Commissioning Mode when setup button is pressed for N seconds when applying power to it. The exact value of N SHALL be made available via PI key. |

|----|----|----|----|
| 18 | Press Setup Button until light blinks with application of power | True | The Device will enter Commissioning Mode when setup button is pressed until associated light blinks when applying power to the Device. Information on color of light MAY be made available via PI key (see Note 1). |
| 19 | Press Setup Button N times | True | The Device will enter Commissioning Mode when setup button is pressed N times with maximum 1 second between each press. The exact value of N SHALL be made avail­ able via PI key. |

> Note 1: When the PH key indicates a light to blink (one or more of bits 9, 11, 16 or 18 is set), informa­ tion on color of light MAY be made available via PI key. When using such color indication in PI key, only basic primary and secondary colors that could unambiguously be decoded by a commissioner and understood by an end-user, but without worry of localization, SHOULD be used, e.g. white, red, green, blue, orange, yellow, purple.
>
> Note 2: Any undefined values are reserved for future use.
>
> Note 3: A Commissionee can indicate multiple ways of being put into Commissioning Mode by set­ ting multiple bits in the bitmap at the same time. However, only one method can be specified which has a dependency on the PI key (PI Dependency=True) at a time.
>
> For example:

- A PH value of 33 (bits 0 and 5 are set) indicates that the user can cause the Commissionee to enter Commissioning Mode by either power cycling it or by following special instructions pro­ vided in the Device Manual.

- A PH value of 9 (bits 0 and 3 are set) indicates that the user can cause the Commissionee to enter Commissioning Mode by either power cycling it or going to the settings menu and following instructions there.

- A PH value of 1 (bit 0 is set) indicates that the user can cause the Commissionee to enter Commis­ sioning Mode only by power cycling it.

- A PH value of 16 (bit 4 is set) indicates that the user can cause the Commissionee to enter Com­ missioning Mode following a custom procedure described by the value of the PI key.

- A PH value of 256 (bits 8 is set) indicates that the user can cause the Commissionee to enter Com­

> missioning Mode by pressing the reset button for a duration of time in seconds specified via by the value of the PI key.
>
> When the PH key is provided, at least one bit in the above bitmap SHALL be set. That is, a PH value of 0 is undefined and illegal.
>
> When the PH key is provided, the Commissioner SHOULD take its value into account when provid­ ing guidance to the user regarding steps required to put the Commissionee into Commissioning Mode.

#### TXT key for pairing instructions (PI)

> The optional key PI MAY give the *pairing instruction*.
>
> If present, the value SHALL be encoded as a valid UTF-8 string with a maximum length of 128 bytes. The meaning of this key is dependent upon the PH key value, see [Table 5, “Pairing Hint Values”](#_bookmark201).
>
> For example, given PH=256, bit 8 is set which indicates "Press Reset Button for N seconds". Therefore, a value of PI=10 would indicate that N is 10 in that context.
>
> When bit 4 of the value expressed by the PH key is set, indicating presence of a custom string, the Commissionee SHALL be responsible for localization (translation to user’s preferred language) as required using the Device’s currently configured locale. The Custom Instruction option is NOT rec­ ommended for use by a Commissionee that does not have knowledge of the user’s language prefer­ ence.
>
> It is RECOMMENDED to keep the length of PI field small and adhere to the guidance given in section 6.2 of \[[RFC 6763](#_bookmark63)\].
>
> This key/value pair SHALL only be returned in the DNS‑SD TXT record if the [PH](#txt-key-for-pairing-hint-ph) bitmap value has a bit set which has PI Dependency = True, see [Table 5, “Pairing Hint Values”](#_bookmark201). The PH key SHALL NOT not have more than one bit set which has a dependency on the PI key (PI Dependency = True) to avoid ambiguity in PI key usage.

#### TXT key for Joint Fabric

> The optional key JF indicates the capabilities of an Ecosystem Administrator that is participating in the Joint Fabric.
>
> The JF key SHALL be present in the DNS‑SD TXT record if and only if the Node is capable of being a Joint Fabric Administrator.
>
> The JF key SHALL be encoded as a variable-length decimal number in ASCII text, omitting any lead­ ing zeroes.
>
> The JF key represents a base-10 numeric value for a bitmap of capabilities for a Joint Fabric Admin­ istrator device.
>
> The bitmap of the Joint Fabric key values is defined in [Table 6, “Joint Fabric Key Values”](#_bookmark204).
>
> *Table 6. Joint Fabric Key Values*

| **Bit index** | **Capability** | **Description** |
|----|----|:---|
| 0 | Available | This device is capable of acting as a Joint Fabric Administrator. (See Note 1) |
| 1 | Administrator | This device is acting as a Joint Fabric Administrator |
| 2 | Anchor | This device is acting as a Joint Fabric Anchor Administrator. (See Note 2) |
| 3 | Datastore | This device is acting as a Joint Fabric Datastore. (See Note 3) |

> Note 1: bit 0 (Available) SHALL be unset for any of bits 1, 2 or 3 to be set. bit 0 (Available) SHALL be set as the default value prior to the Administrator Node being commissioned onto the Joint Fabric. Once an Administrator device is commissioned on the Joint Fabric, bit 0 (Available) SHALL be unset.
>
> Note 2: bit 1 (Administrator) SHALL be set for bit 2 (Anchor) to be set. A device SHALL be a Joint Fabric Administrator to be a Joint Fabric Root CA Anchor. A single device for the Ecosystem (Ven­ dor) which is the Joint Fabric Anchor SHALL have bit 3 (Datastore) set. This means 1 or more devices may have bit 1 (Administrator) and bit 2 (Anchor) set, but not have bit 3 (Datastore) set, but at most 1 device SHALL have bit 3 (Datastore) set.
>
> Note 3: bit 1 (Administrator), bit 2 (Anchor), and bit 3 (Datastore) SHALL all be set for the single device which is the Joint Fabric Datastore.
>
> For example:

- A JF=1 key/value pair indicates that the Administrator Node is capable of being a Joint Fabric Administrator but has not been commissioned onto the Joint Fabric.

- A JF=14 key/value pair (bits 1, 2, and 3 are set) indicates that the device is a Joint Fabric Adminis­ trator, the Joint Fabric Anchor, and a Joint Fabric Datastore device.

- A JF=1 key/value pair (bit 1 is set) indicates that the device is a Joint Fabric Administrator but NOT the Joint Fabric Anchor or a Joint Fabric Datastore device.

> This value MAY change during the lifecycle of the device.
>
> For example, a device might have a value with bit 0 (Available) set and bit 1 (Administrator) unset and bit 2 (Anchor) unset and bit 3 (Datastore) unset prior to being commissioned onto the Joint Fab­ ric, and then have a value with bit 0 (Available) unset and bit 1 (Administrator) set after it has been commissioned onto the Joint Fabric.
>
> The VP key SHALL be present in the DNS‑SD TXT record if the JF key is present and SHALL provide the Vendor ID of the device.
>
> For example:
>
> VP=123 gives the Vendor ID associated with the Joint Fabric Administrator device.

#### Examples

> The examples below simulate a Node in commissioning mode advertising its availability for com­ missioning.
>
> Examples are shown using both the dns-sd command-line test tool and the avahi command-line test tool. The dns-sd command-line test tool is included in all versions of macOS. It is installed as a DOS command with Bonjour for Windows, and is available on Linux by installing the [mDNSResponder](https://github.com/balaji-reddy/mDNSResponder) [package](https://github.com/balaji-reddy/mDNSResponder) \[https://github.com/balaji-reddy/mDNSResponder\]. The Avahi package of command line tools is available from the [Avahi project](https://github.com/lathiat/avahi) \[https://github.com/lathiat/avahi\] for most Linux distributions.
>
> These examples are given for illustrative purposes only. Real Matter Commissionees and Commis­ sioners would not use a command-line test tool for advertising and discovery. Real Matter Commis­ sionees and Commissioners would use the appropriate DNS‑SD APIs in their respective chosen pro­ gramming languages.

> Consider a device on Wi-Fi using the 48-bit device MAC address of B75AFB458ECD as its host name and a value of DD200C20D25AE5F7 as its commissionable service instance name. DNS-SD records for it can be set up as follows:

[TABLE]

> or

[TABLE]

- Short discriminator is filterable through \_S3 subtype and algorithmically through D=840 TXT key.

- Long discriminator is filterable through \_L840 subtype and directly through D=840 TXT key.

- The Commissionee is currently in Commissioning Mode after an Administrator having opened a commissioning window (see [Section 4.3.1.7, “TXT key for commissioning mode (CM)”](#txt-key-for-commissioning-mode-cm)), as shown by CM=2 TXT key and availability by browsing the \_CM subtype.

  - Had the Commissionee been discoverable for initial commissioning rather than subsequent additional commissioning, a CM=1 TXT key would have been published instead.

- Short discriminator is 3, long discriminator is 840.

- Device type is 266 which is a smart plug (On/Off Plugin Unit, Device Type Identifier 0x010A).

- Device name is Kitchen Plug.

- Pairing hint is 256 which indicates that the Commissionee’s reset button must be held down for 5 seconds to enter Commissioning Mode where the value 5 is obtained by reading the value of the PI key.

- Pairing instruction is 5.

[TABLE]

#### Efficiency Considerations

> Discovering and using an offered service on the network typically involves several steps:

1.  Enumeration of instances available on the network ("browsing")

2.  Lookup of a selected instance’s port number, host name, and other additional information, com­ municated in DNS‑SD using SRV and TXT records ("resolving")

3.  Lookup of the IPv6 address(es) associated with the desired target host.

4.  Use of IPv6 Neighbor Discovery and/or IPv6 routing to translate from destination IPv6 address to the next-hop link-layer address for that communication.

5.  Establishing a cryptographically secure communication channel between the two endpoints, and then engaging in useful communication.

> Although the first three steps are exposed in some APIs as separate steps, at a protocol level they usually require only a single network round-trip. When a PTR query is issued to discover service instances, the usual DNS Additional Record mechanism, where packet space permits, automatically places the related SRV, TXT, and address records into the Additional Record section of the reply. These additional records are stored by the client, to enable subsequent steps in the sequence to be performed without additional redundant network operations to learn the same information a sec­ ond time.
>
> DNS‑SD over Multicast DNS works by receiving replies from other Nodes attached to the same local link, Nodes that may have been previously completely unknown to the requester. Because of this, Multicast DNS, like IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, does not have any easy way to distinguish genuine replies from malicious or fraudulent replies. Consequently, application-layer end-to-end security is essential. Should a malicious device on the same local link give deliberately malicious or fraudulent replies, the misbehavior will be detected when the device is unable to establish a cryptographically secure application-layer communication channel. This reduces the threat to a Denial-of-Service attack, which can be remedied by physically removing the offending device.

### Operational Discovery

> For Matter Nodes that have already been commissioned onto a Matter Fabric, run-time dynamic discovery of operational Matter Nodes is used, rather than assuming a fixed unchanging IPv6 address and port for the lifetime of the product. This is done to allow for greater flexibility, so that the underlying IPv6 network can grow and evolve over time as needed without breaking Matter functionality. This is the same reason that other networked consumer electronics products do not assume a single fixed unchanging IP address for the lifetime of the product \[[RFC 5505](#_bookmark55)\].

#### Operational Instance Name

> For Matter operational discovery the DNS‑SD instance name is constructed from a 64-bit [com­](#compressed-fabric-identifier) [pressed Fabric identifier](#compressed-fabric-identifier), and a 64-bit Node identifier, as assigned by the commissioner, each expressed as a fixed-length sixteen-character hexadecimal string, encoded as ASCII (UTF-8) text using capital letters, separated by a hyphen. For example, a Matter Node with Matter compressed fabric identifier 2906-C908-D115-D362 and Matter Node identifier 8FC7-7724-01CD-0696 has Matter operational discovery DNS‑SD instance name 2906C908D115D362-8FC7772401CD0696.
>
> The Matter operational discovery DNS‑SD instance name needs to be unique within the namespace of the local network (the .local link-local namespace of the Ethernet and Wi‑Fi links \[[RFC 6762](#_bookmark62)\], or the unicast domain selected by the Thread Border Router for devices on the Thread mesh). This uniqueness is assumed to be guaranteed by appropriate selection of a unique Matter fabric identi­ fier and unique Node identifier within that Matter fabric.

#### Compressed Fabric Identifier

> In order to reduce the very large size of a full [Fabric Reference](#fabric-references-and-fabric-identifier) which would need to be used as the scoping construct in the [instance name](#operational-instance-name), a 64-bit compressed version of the full Fabric Reference SHALL be used. The computation of the Compressed Fabric Identifier SHALL be as follows:

[TABLE]

> Where:

- TargetOperationalRootPublicKey is the raw uncompressed elliptical curve public key of the root certificate for the advertised Node’s [Operational Certificate](#matter-certificate) chain, without any format marker prefix byte (i.e. after removing the first byte of the ec-pub-key field in the Operational Certifi­ cate’s root).

- TargetOperationalFabricID is the octet string for the Fabric ID as it appears in the advertised Node’s [Operational Certificate](#matter-certificate)'s subject field, under the [1.3.6.1.4.1.37244.1.5](#_bookmark2006) RDN, that is, a 64-bit unsigned integer scalar in big-endian byte order.

> For example, if the root public key for a given Operational Certificate chain containing the identity to be advertised were the following:

[TABLE]

> Then the value for TargetOperationalRootPublicKey to use in the derivation of the compressed Fab­ ric Identifier would be without the leading 04:

[TABLE]

> If using the above TargetOperationalRootPublicKey and a TargetOperationalFabricID value of 0x2906_C908_D115_D362 (octet string 29:06:c9:08:d1:15:d3:62 in big-endian), then the Compressed­ FabricIdentifier to use in advertising would be 87E1B004E235A130 (octet string 87:e1:b0:04:e2:35:a1:30).

#### Operational Service Type

> The DNS‑SD service type \[[RFC 6335](#_bookmark60)\] for Matter Operational Discovery is \_matter.\_tcp. Note that the string \_tcp is boilerplate text inherited from the original DNS SRV specification \[[RFC 2782](#_bookmark44)\], and doesn’t necessarily mean that the advertised application-layer protocol runs only over TCP. It is merely mnemonic text which is there to help human readers, and in no way affects software adver­ tising or using the application-layer protocol identified by that unique IANA-recorded service type string.
>
> The following subtype is defined:
>
> 1\. Compressed Fabric Identifier \_I\<hhhh\>, where \<hhhh\> is the [Compressed Fabric Identifier](#compressed-fabric-identifier) encoded as exactly 16 uppercase hexadecimal characters, for example \_I87E1B004E235A130 for the Compressed Fabric Identifier example of the previous section. This subtype enables filtering of devices per Fabric if service enumeration (browsing) is attempted, to reduce the set of results to Nodes of interest with operational membership in a given Fabric..

#### Operational Service Domain and Host Name

> For link-local Multicast DNS the service domain SHALL be local. For Unicast DNS such as used on Thread the service domain SHALL be as configured automatically by the Thread Border Router.
>
> For DNS‑SD a target host name is required, in addition to the instance name. The target host name SHALL be constructed using one of the available link-layer addresses, such as a 48-bit device MAC address (for Ethernet and Wi‑Fi) or a 64-bit MAC Extended Address (for Thread) expressed as a fixed-length twelve-character (or sixteen-character) hexadecimal string, encoded as ASCII (UTF-8) text using capital letters, e.g., B75AFB458ECD.\<domain\>. In the event that a device performs MAC address randomization for privacy, then the target host name SHALL use the privacy-preserving randomized version and the hostname SHALL be updated in the record every time the underlying link-layer address rotates. Note that it is legal to reuse the same hostname on more than one inter­ face, even if the underlying link-layer address does not match the hostname on that interface, since the goal of using a link-layer address is to ensure local uniqueness of the generated hostname. If future link layers are supported by Matter that do not use 48-bit MAC addresses or 64-bit MAC Extended Address identifiers, then a similar rule will be defined for those technologies.

#### Operational Discovery Service Records

> After discovery, IPv6 addresses are returned in the AAAA records and key/value pairs are returned in the DNS-SD TXT record. The TXT record MAY be omitted if no keys are defined.
>
> Nodes SHALL publish AAAA records for all available IPv6 addresses upon which they are willing to accept operational messages.
>
> Only the common TXT record key/value pairs defined in [Section 4.3.4, “Common TXT Key/Value](#common-txt-keyvalue-pairs) [Pairs”](#common-txt-keyvalue-pairs) are defined for use in Operational Discovery.
>
> Nodes SHALL silently ignore TXT record keys that they do not recognize.

#### Performance Recommendations

> To improve overall performance of operational discovery, especially in large installations, the fol­ lowing recommendations SHOULD be taken in account:

1.  Nodes SHOULD cache the last-known IPv6 address and port for each peer Node with which they interact from their SRV record resolved using DNS-SD, to save the cost of a run-time network lookup operation when not needed. When the IPv6 address and port for a peer Node is not known, or an attempt to communicate with a peer Node at its last-known IPv6 address and port does not appear to be succeeding within the expected network round-trip time (i.e., the retrans­ mission timeout value for the first message packet) a Node SHOULD then perform a run-time discovery in parallel, to determine whether the desired Node has acquired a new IPv6 address and/or port \[[RFC 8305](#_bookmark70)\].

2.  Nodes SHOULD respond to nonspecific service enumeration queries for the generic Matter Operational Discovery service type (\_matter.\_tcp), but these queries SHOULD NOT be used in routine operation, and instead it is RECOMMENDED that they only be used for diagnostics pur­ poses or to determine new membership within a fabric. When used, it is RECOMMENDED that service enumeration employ the \_I\<HHHH\> Fabric-specific subtype to only enumerate the desired Nodes on the Fabric of interest in the local network. Moreover, Known Answer Suppression \[[RFC 6762](#_bookmark62)\] SHOULD be employed in such cases to further minimize the number of unnecessary responses to such a query.

3.  When resolving the operational service record of another Node, a Node SHOULD use an SRV query for the desired operational service instance rather than doing general enumeration of all nodes (e.g. PTR query) followed by filtering for the desired service instance. This recommenda­ tion reduces the amount of multicast traffic generated on-link when Multicast DNS is used, and reduces latency to successful service resolution.

4.  Since proxied DNS-SD service discovery MAY be in use within a given network, and service record caching is expected of DNS-SD clients, Nodes SHOULD NOT use DNS-SD as an operational liveness determination method. This is because there may be stale records not yet expired after a Node becomes unreachable which may still be available.

> The port number 22222 is given here purely as an example. One of the benefits of using DNS‑SD is that services are not constrained to use a single predetermined well-known port. This means that multiple instances of the Matter Node control service can run on the same device at the same time, listening on different ports \[[RFC 6760](#_bookmark61)\]. The port, along with the IPv6 address, is discovered by the Matter controller at run time.

> With Commissioner Discovery, a Commissionee, upon user interaction, MAY discover Commission­ ers on the network and obtain a list of information for each which may include Vendor ID, Product
>
> ID and friendly name. A Commissionee with a user interface, such as a Television, Thermostat or Video Player device, MAY display the list of discovered commissioners to the user for selection. Once selected, the Commissionee MAY use the [User Directed Commissioning](#user-directed-commissioning) protocol with the Com­ missioner to indicate that the user has selected it for commissioning of the Commissionee. The Commissioner Discovery service records thus enable a form of "door bell" protocol to allow a Com­ missionee to request Commissioning.
>
> The Commissioner Discovery feature is optional for both the Commissionee and the Commissioner. Any mandatory requirements described in this section SHALL apply only if the Node or the Com­ missioner supports this feature. To protect customer privacy on public networks, a Matter Commis­ sioner SHALL provide a way for the customer to set a timeout on Commissioner Discovery, or other­ wise disable Commissioner Discovery.
>
> For Commissioner Discovery, the DNS-SD instance name is generated the same way it is done for Commissionable Node Discovery and has the same requirements (uniqueness on local network, and collision detection and recovery) as those in Commissionable Node Discovery, but the require­ ments for when a new instance name is selected from Commissionable Node Discovery do not apply to Commissioner Discovery. The instance name for Commissioner Discovery MAY be selected whenever the Commissioner deems necessary.
>
> The DNS-SD service type \[[RFC 6335](#_bookmark60)\] is \_matterd.\_udp.
>
> The port advertised by a \_matterd.\_udp service record SHALL be different than any port associated with other advertised \_matterc.\_udp, \_matter.\_tcp or \_matterd.\_udp services, in order to ensure that the session-less messaging employed by the [User Directed Commissioning](#user-directed-commissioning) protocol does not cause invalid message handling from fully operational Matter nodes at the same address. In other words, each \_matterd.\_udp service instance needs to be independent from other services to ensure unam­ biguous processing of the incoming User Directed Commissioning messages.
>
> The following subtype is defined:

- \\T\<ddd\> where \<ddd\> is the device type identifier (see Data Model Device Types), encoded as a variable-length decimal number in ASCII (UTF-8) text, without leading zeroes. This optional Device Type subtype enables filtering of results to find only Commissioners that match a device type, for example, to discover Commissioners of type Video Player (35 is decimal representation for Video Player device type identifier 0x0023). For such a Video Player filter, subtype \_T35 would be used.

> For link-local Multicast DNS the service domain SHALL be local. For Unicast DNS such as used on Thread the service domain SHALL be as configured automatically by the Thread Border Router.
>
> The target host name is generated the same way it is done for Commissionable Node Discovery (see [Host Name Construction](#host-name-construction)).
>
> After discovery, IPv6 addresses are returned in the AAAA records and key/value pairs are returned in the DNS‑SD TXT record. The TXT record MAY be omitted if no keys are defined.
>
> Nodes SHALL publish AAAA records for all their available IPv6 addresses.
>
> In addition to the common TXT record key/value pairs defined in [Section 4.3.4, “Common TXT](#common-txt-keyvalue-pairs)
>
> [Key/Value Pairs”](#common-txt-keyvalue-pairs), the following key/value pairs are defined specifically for Commissioner discovery:

- The optional key VP gives vendor and product information. This key is optional for a vendor to provide, and optional for a commissioner to use. This value takes the same format described for the VP key in Commissionable Node Discovery (see [Section 4.3.1.6, “TXT key for Vendor ID and](#txt-key-for-vendor-id-and-product-id-vp) [Product ID (VP)”](#txt-key-for-vendor-id-and-product-id-vp)). This key/value pair MAY be returned in the DNS‑SD TXT record.

- The optional key DT gives the device type identifier for the Commissioner (see Data Model Device Types). This value takes the same format described for the DT key in Commissionable Node Discovery (see [Commissioning Device Type](#txt-key-for-device-type-dt)). This key/value pair MAY be returned in the DNS‑SD TXT record.

- The optional key DN gives the device name. This value takes the same format described for the DN key in Commissionable Node Discovery (see [Commissioning Device Name](#txt-key-for-device-name-dn)). This key/value pair MAY be returned in the DNS‑SD TXT record. To protect customer privacy on public networks, a Matter Commissioner SHALL provide a way for the customer to disable inclusion of this key.

- The optional key CP indicates whether the Commissioner supports the [Commissioner Passcode](#_bookmark501) [feature](#_bookmark501). The absence of key CP SHALL imply a value of 0 (CP=0), and indicates that the publisher does not support the Commissioner Passcode feature. The key/value pair CP=1 SHALL indicate that the publisher supports the Commissioner Passcode feature.

> Commissionees SHALL silently ignore TXT record keys that they do not recognize. This is to facili­ tate future evolution of the Matter Commissioner Discovery protocol specification without breaking backwards compatibility with existing Commissionees that do not implement the new functionality.

#### Examples

> The examples below simulate a Matter Commissioner advertising that it is present on the network.
>
> Examples are shown using both the dns-sd command-line test tool and the avahi command-line test tool. The dns-sd command-line test tool is included in all versions of macOS. It is installed as a DOS command with Bonjour for Windows, and is available on Linux by installing the [mDNSResponder](https://github.com/balaji-reddy/mDNSResponder) [package](https://github.com/balaji-reddy/mDNSResponder) \[https://github.com/balaji-reddy/mDNSResponder\]. The avahi command line-test tool is available from the [Avahi project](https://github.com/lathiat/avahi) \[https://github.com/lathiat/avahi\] for most Linux distributions.
>
> These examples are given for illustrative purposes only.
>
> Consider a device on Wi-Fi using the 48-bit device MAC address of B75AFB458ECD as its host name. DNS-SD records for can be set up as follows:

> This produces DNS-SD messages with the following characteristics:

- Vendor ID is 123, Product ID is 456.

- Device type is 35 which is a Casting Video Player (Device Type Identifier 0x0023).

- Device name is Living Room TV.

> Avahi only sends a single AAAA record. To force the link-local address to be used, use avahi-pub­ lish-address. For example:

### Common TXT Key/Value Pairs

> The TXT records provided during Commissionable, Operational and Commissioner discovery MAY contain the following optional key/value pairs which are common to every discovery method:

- The optional key SII indicates the [SESSION_IDLE_INTERVAL](#_bookmark343) of the Node. This key defines the [MRP retry interval](#retransmissions) for a Node that is Idle. This key MAY optionally be provided by a Node to override the default setting. If the key is not included or invalid, the Node querying the service record SHALL use the default MRP parameter value. The SII value is an unsigned integer with units of milliseconds and SHALL be encoded as a variable-length decimal number in ASCII encoding, omitting any leading zeros. The SII value SHALL NOT exceed 3600000 (1 hour in mil­ liseconds).

  - Example: SII=5300 to override the initial retry interval value to 5.3 seconds.

- The optional key SAI indicates the [SESSION_ACTIVE_INTERVAL](#_bookmark343) of the Node. This key defines the [MRP retry interval](#retransmissions) for a Node that is Active. This key MAY optionally be provided by a Node to override the default setting. If the key is not included or invalid, the Node querying the service record SHALL use the default MRP parameter value. The SAI value is an unsigned integer with units of milliseconds and SHALL be encoded as a variable-length decimal number in ASCII encoding, omitting any leading zeros. The SAI value SHALL NOT exceed 3600000 (1 hour in mil­ liseconds).

  - Example: SAI=1250 to override the active retry interval value to 1.25 seconds.

- The optional key SAT indicates the [SESSION_ACTIVE_THRESHOLD](#_bookmark343) of the Node. This key defines the duration of time the Node stays Active after the last network activity. This key MAY option­ ally be provided by a Node to override the default setting. If the key is not included or invalid, the Node querying the service record SHALL use the default MRP parameter value. The SAT value is an unsigned integer with units of milliseconds and SHALL be encoded as a variable- length decimal number in ASCII encoding, omitting any leading zeros. The SAT value SHALL NOT exceed 65535 (65.535 seconds).

  - Example: SAT=1250 to override the active retry interval value to 1.25 seconds.

> This key defines the duration of time the Node stays Active after the last network activity.

- The optional key T indicates various additional transport protocol modes, apart from [MRP](#message-reliability-protocol-mrp) over UDP, that are supported by a Node. If the key is not included or invalid, the Node querying the service record SHALL assume the default value of T=0 indicating that only MRP is supported as a transport protocol. The T key, if included, SHALL be encoded as a decimal number in ASCII text, omitting any leading zeroes.

  - It represents a base-10 numeric value for a bitmap of various additional transport protocol

> modes supported by the advertising Node.

- For example, the T=6 key/value pair represents a value with bits 1 and 2 set, and bit 0 cleared.

- Bit index 0 is deprecated and SHALL always be set to 0 by the advertising node and ignored by nodes processing this key.

- The fields in the bitmap for values of the T key are currently defined below in [Table 7, “Sup­](#_bookmark216) [ported Transport Mode Values”](#_bookmark216) below.

> Thus, a Node advertising with key T=6 represents both a TCP client and a TCP server, but a Node advertising with T=2 can only be a TCP client.
>
> **NOTE** TCP client flag and TCP server flags are provisional. These flags SHALL NOT be set.
>
> *Table 7. Supported Transport Mode Values*

| **Bit index** | **Name** | **Description** |
|----|----|----|
| 0 | Reserved | This bit index is deprecated and SHALL be set to 0. Clients SHALL silently ignore this bit. |
| 1 | TCP Client | The advertising Node imple­ ments the TCP Client mode and MAY connect to a peer Node that is a TCP Server. |
| 2 | TCP Server | The advertising Node imple­ ments the TCP Server mode and SHALL listen for incoming TCP connections. |

> Because the information carried in DNS-SD records with Matter is not trustworthy (since the source is not authenticated), the value of the T key SHOULD be regarded only as a hint. The only reliable way to determine which transports are supported by a Node is to connect to it using CASE over MRP and get the list of supported transports from the [session parameters](#_bookmark343).

- The optional key ICD indicates whether the Node is operating as a Long Idle Time ICD or as a Short Idle Time ICD. The key SHALL NOT be provided by a Node that does not support the ICD Long Idle Time operating mode. If the key is invalid or not included, the Node querying the ser­ vice record SHALL assume the default value of ICD=0 indicating that the ICD is not in the Long Idle Time operating mode. If the ICD key is included, it SHALL have one of the two valid values:

  - 0 to indicate "Long Idle Time ICD is not operating as a Long Idle Time ICD",

  - 1 to indicate "Long Idle Time ICD is operating as a Long Idle Time ICD".

    - Example: ICD=1 to announce that the ICD is in the Long Idle Time operating mode.

#### NOTE

> Since the information carried by DNS-SD records are not authenticated in Matter’s usage of this protocol, security-critical decisions SHOULD NOT be made solely on the basis of them. Rather, this information SHOULD be regarded as a hint that needs verification.

## Message Frame Format

> This section describes the encoding of the Matter message format. The Matter message format pro­ vides flexible support for various communication paradigms, including unicast secure sessions, multicast group messaging, and session establishment itself. The process of encrypting Matter mes­ sages is the same in all modes of communication, and assumes symmetric keys are shared between communicating parties. Unencrypted messages are used only for protocols which bootstrap secure messaging, such as session establishments.
>
> Matter messages are used by Matter applications, as well as the Matter protocol stack itself, to con­ vey application-specific data and/or commands. The Protocol portion of a Matter message contains a [Protocol ID](#protocol-id-16-bits) and [Protocol Opcode](#protocol-opcode-8-bits) which identify both the semantic meaning of the message as well as the structure of any associated application payload data. Matter messages also convey an [Exchange ID](#exchange-id-16-bits), which relates the message to a particular exchange (i.e. conversation) taking place between two nodes. Finally, certain types of Matter messages can convey information that acknowl­ edges the reception of an earlier message. This is used as part of the [Message Reliability Protocol](#message-reliability-protocol-mrp) to provide guaranteed delivery of messages over unreliable transports.
>
> All multi-byte integer fields are transmitted in little-endian byte order unless otherwise noted in the field description.
>
> Matter messages are structured as follows:
>
> **NOTE** \[\] denotes the field is optional.
>
> *Table 8. Matter Message format definition*

[TABLE]

> The Message Payload of a Matter message SHALL contain a Protocol Message with format as fol­ lows:
>
> *Table 9. Protocol Message format definition*

[TABLE]

### Message Header Field Descriptions

#### Message Flags (8 bits)

> An unsigned integer bit field containing the following subfields:
>
> *Table 10. Message Flags field definition*

[TABLE]

#### NOTE

> All unused bits in the Message Flags field are reserved and SHALL be set to zero on transmission and SHALL be silently ignored on reception.
>
> **Version (4 bits, positions 4-7)**
>
> An unsigned integer specifying the version of the Matter Message format used to encode the mes­ sage. Currently only one version is defined:

- 0 — Matter Message Format version 1.0

- 1-15 — Reserved for future use

> Messages with version field set to reserved values SHALL be dropped without sending a message- layer acknowledgement.

#### NOTE

> The Version field conveys information solely about the structure of the Matter mes­ sage itself, not about the structure of the application payload or the interpretation of the message’s type. Thus, changes to how an application handles or interprets a message do not result in the creation of a new message format version number.
>
> **S Flag (1 bit, position 2)**
>
> A single bit field which SHALL be set if and only if the [Source Node ID](#source-node-id-64-bits) field is present.
>
> **DSIZ Field (2 bits, position 0-1)**
>
> This field SHALL indicate the size and meaning of the [Destination Node ID](#destination-node-id) field.

- 0 — Destination Node ID field is not present

- 1 — Destination Node ID field is present as a 64-bit Node ID

- 2 — Destination Node ID field is present as a 16-bit Group ID

- 3 — Reserved for future use

> Messages with DSIZ field set to reserved values SHALL be dropped without sending a message-layer acknowledgement.

#### Session ID (16 bits)

> An unsigned integer value identifying the session associated with this message. The session identi­ fies the particular key used to encrypt a message out of the set of available keys (either session or group), and the particular encryption/message integrity algorithm to use for the message. The Ses­ sion ID field is always present. For details on derivation of this field, see respective sections on [uni­](#choosing-secure-unicast-session-identifiers) [cast](#choosing-secure-unicast-session-identifiers) and [group](#group-session-id) session ID derivation.

#### Security Flags (8 bits)

> An unsigned integer bit field containing the following subfields:
>
> *Table 11. Security Flags field definition*

| **bit 7** | **6** | **5** | **4**    | **3** | **2** | **1**        | **0** |
|-----------|-------|-------|----------|-------|-------|--------------|-------|
| P         | C     | MX    | Reserved |       |       | Session Type |       |

#### NOTE

> All unused bits in the Security Flags field are reserved and SHALL be set to zero on transmission and SHALL be silently ignored on reception.
>
> **P Flag (1 bit, position 7)**
>
> The Privacy (P) flag is a single bit field which, when set, SHALL identify that the message is encoded with privacy enhancements as specified in [Section 4.9.3, “Privacy Processing of Outgoing Mes­](#privacy-processing-of-outgoing-messages) [sages”](#privacy-processing-of-outgoing-messages).
>
> **C Flag (1 bit, position 6)**
>
> The Control message (C) flag is a single bit field which, when set, SHALL identify that the message is a control message, such as for the [Message Counter Synchronization Protocol](#message-counter-synchronization-protocol-mcsp), and uses the control message counter for the nonce field as specified in [Section 4.8.1.1, “Nonce”](#nonce).
>
> **MX Flag (1 bit, position 5)**
>
> The Message Extensions (MX) flag is a single bit field which, when set, SHALL indicate that the [Mes­](#message-extensions-variable) [sage Extensions](#message-extensions-variable) portion of the message is present and has non-zero length. Version 1.0 Nodes SHALL set this flag to zero.
>
> **Session Type (2 bit, position 0-1)**
>
> An unsigned integer specifying the type of session associated with the message. The following val­ ues are defined:

- 0 — Unicast Session

- 1 — Group Session

- 2-3 — Reserved for future use

> Messages with Session Type set to reserved values are not valid and SHALL be dropped without sending a message-layer acknowledgement.
>
> The Session Type defines how the Session ID is to be interpreted.
>
> The *Unsecured Session* SHALL be indicated when both Session Type and Session ID are set to 0. The
>
> *Unsecured Session* SHALL have no encryption, privacy, or message integrity checking.
>
> A *Secure Unicast Session* SHALL be indicated when Session Type is Unicast Session and Session ID is NOT 0.

#### Message Counter (32 bits)

> An unsigned integer value uniquely identifying the message from the perspective of the sending node. The message counter is [generated](#message-counters) based on the Session Type and increases monotonically for each unique message generated. When messages are retransmitted, using the reliable messaging capabilities, the counter remains the same, as logical retransmission is of a given message as identi­ fied by its message counter. Similarly, [acknowledgements](#_bookmark241) refer to values of the message counter being acknowledged.

#### NOTE

> The Message Counter field is scoped to a given Encryption Key. Also, the Message Counter values are independent for control messages and data messages, as indi­ cated by the [C Flag](#_bookmark228). So it is possible to have the same Message Counter for two mes­ sages encrypted with different keys, as well as two messages encrypted with the same key but different values of the [C Flag](#_bookmark228).

#### Source Node ID (64 bits)

> An optional sequence of 8 bytes containing the unique identifier of the source node. The Source Node ID field SHALL only be present in a message when the [S Flag](#_bookmark223) in the Message Flags field is set to 1.

#### Destination Node ID

> The optional Destination Node ID field contains the unique Node Identifier of the destination Node
>
> or group to which the message is being sent. The size and encoding of the Destination Node ID field depends on the value of the [DSIZ](#_bookmark224) field.

#### Message Extensions (variable)

> The Message Extensions field is a variable length block of data for providing backwards compatible extensibility. The format of the Message Extensions block is shown in [Table 12, “Message Extensions](#_bookmark235) [block format definition”](#_bookmark235). The Message Extensions block SHALL be present only if the [MX Flag](#_bookmark229) is set to 1 in the Security Flags field.
>
> *Table 12. Message Extensions block format definition*

[TABLE]

> If the [MX Flag](#_bookmark229) is set to 1, the Message Extensions Payload Length field SHALL be present and SHALL contain the length of the Message Extensions Payload. The Message Extensions Payload Length field SHALL NOT be privacy obfuscated.
>
> Version 1.0 Nodes SHALL ignore the contents of the Message Extensions payload, by skipping it, to access the [Message Payload](#_bookmark219).

### Message Footer Field Descriptions

#### 4.4.2.1. Message Integrity Check (variable length)

> A sequence of bytes containing the message integrity check value (a.k.a. tag or MIC) for the mes­ sage. The length and byte order of the field depend on the integrity check algorithm in use as speci­ fied in [Section 3.6, “Data Confidentiality and Integrity”](#data-confidentiality-and-integrity).
>
> The Message Integrity Check field SHALL be present for all messages except those of [Unsecured Ses­](#_bookmark230) [sion Type](#_bookmark230).
>
> The MIC is calculated as described in [Section 4.8.2, “Security Processing of Outgoing Messages”](#security-processing-of-outgoing-messages).

### Protocol Header Field Descriptions

#### Exchange Flags (8 bits)

> An unsigned integer bit field containing the following subfields:
>
> *Table 13. Exchange Flags field definition*

| **bit 7** | **6** | **5** | **4** | **3** | **2** | **1** | **0** |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| \-        | \-    | \-    | V     | SX    | R     | A     | I     |

#### NOTE

> All unused bits in the Exchange Flags field are reserved and SHALL be set to zero on transmission and SHALL be silently ignored on reception.
>
> **I Flag (1 bit, position 0)**
>
> The Initiator (I) flag is a single bit field which, when set, SHALL indicate that the message was sent by the initiator of the exchange.
>
> **A Flag (1 bit, position 1)**
>
> The Acknowledgement (A) flag is a single bit field which, when set, SHALL indicate that the mes­ sage serves as an acknowledgement of a previous message received by the current message sender.
>
> **R Flag (1 bit, position 2)**
>
> The Reliability (R) flag is a single bit field which, when set, SHALL indicate that the message sender wishes to receive an acknowledgement for the message.
>
> **SX Flag (1 bit, position 3)**
>
> The Secured Extensions (SX) flag is a single bit field which, when set, SHALL indicate that the [Secured Extensions](#secured-extensions-variable) portion of the message is present and has non-zero length. Version 1.0 Nodes SHALL set this flag to zero.
>
> **V Flag (1 bit, position 4)**
>
> The Vendor (V) protocol flag is a single bit field which, when set, SHALL indicate whether the Proto­ col Vendor ID is present.

#### Protocol Opcode (8 bits)

> An unsigned integer value identifying the type of the message. The Protocol Opcode is interpreted relative to the Matter protocol specified in the [Protocol ID](#protocol-id-16-bits) field.
>
> Opcodes are defined by the corresponding Protocol specification, for example [Secure Channel Pro­](#_bookmark308) [tocol](#_bookmark308).

#### Exchange ID (16 bits)

> An unsigned integer value identifying the exchange to which the message belongs. An Exchange ID is allocated by the initiator of the exchange, and is unique within the initiator exchange number space as specified in [Section 4.10.2, “Exchange ID”](#exchange-id).

#### Protocol ID (16 bits)

> An unsigned integer value identifying the protocol in which the [Protocol Opcode](#protocol-opcode-8-bits) of the message is defined.
>
> When the [Protocol Vendor ID](#protocol-vendor-id-16-bits) is the [Matter Standard Vendor ID](#_bookmark110), the Protocol ID SHALL have one of the values specified by [Table 14, “Protocol IDs for the Matter Standard Vendor ID”](#_bookmark248).
>
> *Table 14. Protocol IDs for the [Matter Standard Vendor ID](#_bookmark110)*

[TABLE]

#### Protocol Vendor ID (16 bits)

> An optional, unsigned integer value that contains the Vendor ID namespacing for the [Protocol ID](#protocol-id-16-bits) field. This field SHALL only be present when the [V Flag](#_bookmark244) is set; otherwise the default is 0, corre­ sponding to the [Matter Standard Vendor ID](#_bookmark110).

#### Acknowledged Message Counter (32 bits)

> An optional, unsigned integer value containing the message counter of a previous message that is being acknowledged by the current message. The Acknowledged Message Counter field is SHALL only be present when the [A Flag](#_bookmark241) in the Exchange Flags field is 1.

#### Secured Extensions (variable)

> The Secured Extensions field is a variable length block of data for providing backwards compatible extensibility. The format of the Secured Extensions block is shown in [Table 15, “Secured Extensions](#_bookmark256) [block format definition”](#_bookmark256). The Secured Extensions block SHALL be present only if the [SX Flag](#_bookmark243) is set to 1 in the Exchange Flags field.
>
> Version 1.0 Nodes SHALL ignore the contents of the Secured Extensions payload.
>
> The Secured Extensions block SHALL be encrypted and authenticated based on the Security Flags settings.
>
> *Table 15. Secured Extensions block format definition*

[TABLE]

#### Application Payload (variable length)

> A sequence of zero or more bytes containing the application data conveyed by the message.

### Message Size Requirements

> Support for IPv6 fragmentation is not mandatory in Matter, and the expected supported MTU is 1280 bytes, the minimum required by IPv6. Therefore, all messages, including transport headers, SHALL fit within that minimal IPv6 MTU. This message size limit SHALL apply to the UDP transport and Wi-Fi Public Action Frame transport . A message received over UDP or Wi-Fi Public Action Frame transport that exceeds this message size limit SHALL NOT be processed. Messages sent over TCP or [BTP](#bluetooth-transport-protocol-btp) transports MAY exceed the message size limit if both nodes are capable of supporting larger message sizes.

## Message Framing Over Stream-Oriented Transports

> When Matter messages are transferred over stream-oriented transport protocols, such as TCP or [BTP](#bluetooth-transport-protocol-btp), they need to be framed appropriately to enable the receiver to read each message from the stream. To allow that, each Matter Message SHALL be prepended with a [Message Length](#message-length-1632-bits) field. This field SHALL only be present when the message is being transmitted over a stream-oriented chan­ nel. When transmitted over a datagram channel, the message length SHALL be conveyed by the underlying channel. For example, when transmitted over UDP, the message length SHALL be equal to the payload length of the UDP datagram.

### Message Length (16/32 bits)

> An optional unsigned integer value, in little-endian byte order, specifying the overall length of the message in bytes, not including the size of this field itself. The size of this field, when present, SHALL depend on the transport protocol being used to transfer the message. For example, for TCP, it SHALL be set to 4 bytes to allow for large payloads, whereas for BTP it SHALL be set to 2 bytes.

[TABLE]

## Message Counters

> All messages contain a 32-bit message counter assigned by the sender of the message. Message counters are assigned sequentially, by monotonically increasing the counter value maintained by the sender of the message. Message counters serve several purposes:

- **Duplicate Message Detection** – Receiving systems use message counters to detect messages that have been retransmitted by the sender, e.g. in response to packet loss in the network.

- **Message Acknowledgement** – In the Message Reliability Protocol (MRP), message counters pro­ vide a way for receivers to identify messages for the purpose of acknowledging their receipt.

- **Encryption Nonces** – When encrypted messages are sent, message counters provide an encryp­

> tion nonce that ensures each message is encrypted in a unique manner.

- **Replay Prevention** – Related to encryption, message counters also provide a means for detect­ ing and preventing the replay of encrypted messages.

### Message Counter Types

> All Nodes implement three global 32-bit counters to generate message counters for certain types of messages:

- *Global Unencrypted Message Counter*

- *Global Group Encrypted Data Message Counter*

- *Global Group Encrypted Control Message Counter*

> Additionally, Nodes implement a separate 32-bit counter for each session as part of secure session state:

- *Secure Session Message Counter*

> Additionally, Nodes implement a separate 32-bit counter for each [Check-In Protocol](#check-in-protocol) use case:

- *Check-In Counter*

> Technical details for how each counter type works are described in the following sections. [Table 16,](#_bookmark263) [“Message Counter Type Overview”](#_bookmark263) is provided to summarize higher-level differences between Mes­ sage Counter Types:
>
> *Table 16. Message Counter Type Overview*

| **Message Counter Type** | **Session Type** | **Lifetime** | **Rollover Pol­ icy** | **Nonvolatile** |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| [Global Unencrypted](#global-unencrypted-message-counter) | [Unsecured](#_bookmark230) | Unlimited | Allowed | Optional |

#### Message Counter Initialization

> All message counters SHALL be initialized with a random value using the [Crypto_DRBG(len = 28) +](#deterministic-random-bit-generator-drbg) [1](#deterministic-random-bit-generator-drbg) primitive. Message counters are initialized to a random number to increase the difficulty of traffic analysis attacks by making it harder to determine how long a particular session has been open. The random initializer ranges from 1 to 2²⁸ in order to maximize initial entropy while still reserving the vast majority of the range to actual counter values (roughly 2³² - 2²⁸).

#### Global Unencrypted Message Counter

> All Nodes SHALL implement an unencrypted message counter, which is used to generate counters for unencrypted messages.
>
> Typically, Nodes store the *Global Unencrypted Message Counter* in RAM. This makes the counter sub­ ject to loss whenever the system reboots or otherwise loses its state. This is permissible because retaining the *Global Unencrypted Message Counter* is not essential to the confidentiality or integrity of the message. In the event that the *Global Unencrypted Message Counter* for a Node is lost, Nodes SHALL randomize the initial value of this counter on startup per [Section 4.6.1.1, “Message Counter](#message-counter-initialization) [Initialization”](#message-counter-initialization).

#### Global Group Encrypted Message Counters

> The *Global Group Encrypted Message Counters* are used to generate the counter for messages encrypted using group keys. There are two such counters:

- The *Global Group Encrypted Data Message Counter* is used to encode regular data messages encrypted with a group key.

- The *Global Group Encrypted Control Message Counter* is used to encode [control messages](#_bookmark228) encrypted with a group key.

> Some Nodes might not be required to implement communication using group keys, in which case they MAY omit the *Global Group Encrypted Message Counters*. In contrast to the *Global Unencrypted Message Counter*, Nodes are required to persist the *Global Group Encrypted Message Counters* in durable storage. In particular, Nodes are required to ensure that the value of the *Global Group Encrypted Message Counters* never rolls back and that it is monotonic within the bounds of its range for its use for a given group key. A Node SHALL randomize the initial value of this counter on fac­ tory reset per [Section 4.6.1.1, “Message Counter Initialization”](#message-counter-initialization).
>
> While *Global Group Encrypted Message Counters* are shared by many group keys to generate nonces, rollover is not an issue as long as the [Epoch Key](#epoch-keys) that generates each [operational group key](#operational-group-key-derivation) rotates frequently enough.

#### NOTE

> If a nonce is duplicated for a given key, the security consequences are isolated only to the specific key with which the duplicate nonce occurred — a key that has not been updated prior to rollover and has been presumably abandoned or aged out.

### Secure Session Message Counters

> A *Secure Session Message Counter* is a per-session, 32-bit, ephemeral counter that is used by the encoding of any encrypted messages using an associated session key. Each peer in a [Secure Unicast](#_bookmark230) [Session](#_bookmark230) SHALL maintain its own message counters, with independent counters being used for each unique session used. *Session Message Counters* SHALL exist for as long as the associated security session is in effect. A Node SHALL randomize the initial value of this counter on session establish­ ment per [Section 4.6.1.1, “Message Counter Initialization”](#message-counter-initialization).
>
> The *Secure Session Message Counter* history window SHALL be maintained for the lifetime of the session, and SHALL be deleted at the same time as the session keys, when the session ends.
>
> Sessions SHALL be discarded and re-established before any *Secure Session Message Counter* over­ flow or repetition occurs.

### Check-In Counter

> The Check-In Counter is an unsigned 32-bit counter used during the encryption process of the [Check-In Protocol](#check-in-protocol). The only purpose of the Check-In Counter is during the encryption process of the [Check-In Protocol](#check-in-protocol).
>
> Each Check-In Protocol use-case implemented by a device SHALL be associated with a specific Check-In counter to be used for each node identity (pair of fabric and node identifier). This MAY be a single counter across all node identities, or MAY be one counter per node identity, or anything in between, as long as each node identity uses a single specific instance of the counter. The device SHALL randomize the initial value of the counter on factory reset per [Section 4.6.1.1, “Message](#message-counter-initialization) [Counter Initialization”](#message-counter-initialization).
>
> The Check-In Counter SHALL be monotonically increased each time a [Check-In message](#check-in-protocol) is sent. This monotonicity guarantee SHALL be preserved across idle and active states. The Check-In Counter can roll over to zero when it exceeds the maximum value of the counter (32-bits). Nodes are required to persist the *Check-In Counter* in durable storage.
>
> When a node reboots, the *Check-In Counter* MAY increase by a larger step than 1. Nodes do not need to write every new value of the Check-In Counter to permanent storage each time it is increased (e.g. to prevent flash wear due to many write operations). One example strategy to achieve reduc­ tion of non-volatile storage updates is described below:

1.  Read the counter value at start-up.

2.  Before processing the first message after startup, write counter + N to storage, where N is a carefully chosen number (e.g. 1000). This number N should be chosen carefully in order not to exhaust the lifetime 32-bit counter space.

3.  Process messages normally until the counter has a value one less than the counter in storage. When this happens, store counter + N to storage.

#### NOTE

> The Check-In Counter has an unlimited lifetime until the device is factory reset. To ensure that a nonce is not reused since it is derived from the Check-In Counter and the ICD key, the key needs to be refreshed before using all valid counter values for the key.

### Message Counters as Encryption Nonces

> In the context of encrypted messages, message counters serve as nonces for the encryption algo­ rithm, ensuring that every message is encrypted in a unique manner. The uniqueness of an encrypted message’s counter is vital to the confidentiality of the message, as the encryption algo­ rithm makes it trivial for an eavesdropper to decrypt messages if the attacker can find two different messages with the same message counter that were encrypted using the same key. Specifically, an attacker can XOR the two different messages that share the same key and nonce to obtain a "block key" which can be used to decrypt any message that uses that key and nonce.
>
> Nodes SHOULD rotate their encryption keys on a regular basis, to ensure that old encryption keys are retired before a *Global Group Encrypted Message Counter* has a chance to wrap to a value previ­ ously used with the encryption key. In practice, the frequency of message transmission is such that encryption keys generally rotate at a rate that is much faster than the rate at which a *Global Group Encrypted Message Counter* wraps. In the event that a *Global Group Encrypted Message Counter* wraps before the associated keys are rotated, all keys associated with that *Global Group Encrypted Message Counter* are considered exhausted and are no longer valid to use. In such cases, a new uni­ cast session SHALL be established to the Matter Node to rotate such retired keys before secure com­ munication can resume. Given the importance of confidentiality and message integrity, every effort SHOULD be made to ensure that keys are rotated on a regular basis.

### Replay Prevention and Duplicate Message Detection

> Beyond their role as encryption nonces, message counters also serve as a means to detect repeated reception of the same message. Message duplication may occur for a number of reasons: out-of- order arrival, network latency, malicious attack, or network error. For example, a duplicate can be caused when a sender retransmits a message after failing to receive an acknowledgement, or because a malicious third party attempted to replay an old message to gain some advantage. To detect duplicate messages, Nodes maintain a history window of the message counters they have received from a particular sender (see [Message Reception State](#message-reception-state)). Whenever a message is received, its message counter is checked against the history window of message counters from that sender to determine whether it is a duplicate. The Message Layer SHALL discard duplicate messages before they reach the application layer.

#### Message Reception State

> The state maintained by a Node about the messages it has received from a particular peer is referred to as *message reception state*. Nodes use this state information to determine whether a newly arrived message is a duplicate of a previous message. Message reception state is maintained on a per-peer or per-session basis, depending on the type of message encryption being used.
>
> At a conceptual level, message reception state consists of a set of integers corresponding to the counters of all the messages that have been received from a particular peer. To limit the amount of memory required to store this state, Nodes employ a lossy compression scheme that takes advan­ tage of the fact that message counters are generated sequentially by the sender. The scheme allows for a limited amount of out-of-order message arrivals due to network effects without inducing false detection of duplicates.
>
> In the compressed form, message reception state is structured as a pair of values: a integer repre­ senting the largest valid, or maximum message counter received from the peer (max_message\_­ counter), and a bitmap of size [*MSG_COUNTER_WINDOW_SIZE*](#_bookmark319) indicating which messages immedi­ ately prior to the max message have been received. The offset into the bitmap equates to the differ­ ence between the corresponding message counter and the max message counter, i.e. the first bit in the bitmap indicates whether the message with the counter of max_message_counter - 1 has been received, the second indicates whether message max_message_counter - 2 has been received, and so on. A message counter is within the range of the bitmap, also known as the message counter win­ dow, when the counter value is between \[(max_message_counter - MSG_COUNTER_WINDOW_SIZE) to (max_message_counter - 1) mod 2³²\]. As messages arrive, the message reception state is queried to determine if an arriving message is new or duplicate. If a message is new, the state is then updated
>
> to reflect the arrival of the message. When a message arrives with a message counter that is logi­ cally greater than the current maximum message counter for that peer, the maximum message counter value for the peer is updated and the bitmap shifted accordingly.

> *Figure 7. Message Reception State Example*

#### Use of Message Reception State for Encrypted Messages

> The algorithm for querying and updating message reception state varies slightly depending on whether the system is tracking reception of encrypted messages or unencrypted messages.
>
> **Message Counters with maximum**
>
> For encrypted messages of [Secure Unicast Session Type](#_bookmark230), any arriving message with a counter in the range \[(max_message_counter + 1) to (2³² - 1)\] SHALL be considered new, and cause the max_mes­ sage_counter value to be updated. Message counters within the range of the bitmap SHALL be con­ sidered duplicate if the corresponding bit offset is set to true. All other message counters SHALL be considered duplicate.
>
> **Message Counters with rollover**
>
> A message counter with rollover is a free running message counter that monotonically increases, but rolls over to zero when it exceeds the maximum value of the counter (32-bits). Group keys are secured by a shared, global message counter with rollover as described in [Section 4.6.1.3, “Global](#global-group-encrypted-message-counters) [Group Encrypted Message Counters”](#global-group-encrypted-message-counters).
>
> For encrypted messages of [Group Session Type](#_bookmark230), any arriving message with a counter in the range
>
> \[(max_message_counter + 1) to (max_message_counter + 2³¹ - 1)\] (modulo 2³²) SHALL be considered
>
> new, and cause the max_message_counter value to be updated. Messages with counters from
>
> \[(max_message_counter - 2³¹) to (max_message_counter - MSG_COUNTER_WINDOW_SIZE - 1)\] (modulo 2
>
> ³²) SHALL be considered duplicate. A message counter equal to max_message_counter SHALL be con­
>
> sidered duplicate. Message counters within the range of the bitmap SHALL be considered duplicate if the corresponding bit offset is set to true.
>
> This scheme for encrypted messages effectively divides the message counter space in half: those counters that are forward of the max message counter, which are considered new, and those coun­ ters that are behind the max message counter, which are considered duplicates unless indicated otherwise by the values in the bitmap.

#### Use of Message Reception State for Unencrypted Messages

> For unencrypted messages, the algorithms for tracking messages and detecting duplicates are simi­ lar to, but more permissive than for encrypted messages using [Section 4.6.5.2.2, “Message Counters](#_bookmark273) [with rollover”](#_bookmark273). This reflects the fact that duplicate detection of unencrypted messages is not done for security reasons, but rather to catch duplicates caused by network errors (e.g. loss of an ack), which are generally more bounded in time. The more relaxed algorithm for unencrypted duplicate detection also relaxes the durability requirement on the sender’s message counter, allowing senders to store the counter in RAM.
>
> For unencrypted messages, any message counter equal to max_message_counter or within the mes­ sage counter window, where the corresponding bit is set to true SHALL be considered duplicate. All other message counters, whether behind the window or ahead of max_message_counter, are consid­ ered new and SHALL update max_message_counter and shift the window accordingly. Messages with a counter behind the window are likely caused by a node rebooting and are thus processed as rolling back the window to the current location. Note that when max_message_counter is close to the minimum of the range, the window SHALL roll back to cover message counters near the maximum of the range.

#### Message Reception State Initialization

> To initialize [Message Reception State](#message-reception-state) for a given Peer Node ID, initial max_message_counter, Message Type (control or data), Encryption Level (encrypted or unencrypted), and Encryption Key (for any Encryption Level except unencrypted):

- The Message Reception State fields SHALL be set as follows:

  - The Peer Node ID SHALL reference the given Peer Node ID.

  - The Message Type SHALL be the given Message Type.

  - The Encryption Level SHALL be the given Encryption Level.

  - If the Encryption Level is NOT unencrypted, the Encryption Key SHALL reference the given key.

  - The max_message_counter SHALL be set to the given max_message_counter.

  - The Message Counter bitmap SHALL be set to all 1, indicating that only new messages with counter greater than max_message_counter SHALL be accepted.

### Counter Processing of Outgoing Messages

1.  Obtain the outgoing message counter of the sending Node for the given Security Flags, Session Id, and Encryption Key:

    1.  A message of [Unsecured Session Type](#_bookmark230) SHALL use the current *Global Unencrypted Message Counter*.

    2.  A message of [Secure Unicast Session Type](#_bookmark230) SHALL use the current *Secure Session Message Counter* for the session associated with the Session ID.

    3.  A message of [Group Session Type](#_bookmark230) SHALL use:

        1.  The *Global Group Encrypted Data Message Counter* if the Security Flags [C Flag](#_bookmark228) = 0.

        2.  The *Global Group Encrypted Control Message Counter* if the Security Flags [C Flag](#_bookmark228) = 1.

2.  The outgoing message counter from step 1 SHALL be incremented by 1.

3.  Store the incremented outgoing message counter in the *OutgoingMessageCounter* element asso­ ciated with the [Session Context](#secure-session-context) for the message.

    1.  If the message counter wraps around from 0xFFFF_FFFF to 0x0000_0000 and the message is of [Secure Unicast Session Type](#_bookmark230):

        1.  The Encryption Key SHALL be expired in the [Session Context](#secure-session-context). The session will need to be renegotiated to resume communication after transmission of this final message.

### Counter Processing of Incoming Messages

1.  Determine the [Message Reception State](#message-reception-state) for the sending peer and get the current max_message\_­ counter.

    1.  Given a decrypted message of [Unicast Session Type](#_bookmark230):

        1.  Get the session-specific [Message Reception State](#message-reception-state) from the [Secure Unicast Session Con­](#secure-session-context) [text](#secure-session-context).

    2.  Given a decrypted message of [Group Session Type](#_bookmark230):

        1.  Extract the Source Node ID from the [Message Header](#message-header-field-descriptions).

            1.  If there is no Source Node ID for the message, drop the message.

        2.  Get the [Message Reception State](#message-reception-state) for the [Source Node ID](#source-node-id-64-bits) of the given message:

            1.  If the Security Flags [C Flag](#_bookmark228) = 0, get the Data Message Reception State for the peer node.

            2.  If the Security Flags [C Flag](#_bookmark228) = 1, get the Control Message Reception State for the peer node.

        3.  If there is no [Message Reception State](#message-reception-state) for the groupcast message, initiate [Section 4.18.4,](#unsynchronized-message-processing) [“Unsynchronized Message Processing”](#unsynchronized-message-processing).

    3.  Given an unencrypted message:

        1.  Get the [Message Reception State](#message-reception-state) associated with the [Unsecured Session Context](#unsecured-session-context).

        2.  If there is no [Message Reception State](#message-reception-state) for the unencrypted message, [create it](#message-reception-state-initialization) with the information from the given message.

2.  If the Message Counter is outside the valid message counter window, the message SHALL be marked as a duplicate. Note that while messages may be outside of the window for reasons other than being a duplicate, and we always mark them as such.

3.  If the message is a duplicate:

    1.  If the message is marked as encrypted, follow [Section 4.6.5.2, “Use of Message Reception](#use-of-message-reception-state-for-encrypted-messages) [State for Encrypted Messages”](#use-of-message-reception-state-for-encrypted-messages).

    2.  If the message is marked as unencrypted, follow [Section 4.6.5.3, “Use of Message Reception](#use-of-message-reception-state-for-unencrypted-messages) [State for Unencrypted Messages”](#use-of-message-reception-state-for-unencrypted-messages).

    3.  If the message is encrypted and marked as a duplicate, i.e. Message Counter is outside the valid message counter window or marked as previously received in the [Message Reception](#message-reception-state) [State](#message-reception-state):

        1.  Perform [Section 4.12.5.2, “Reliable Message Processing of Incoming Messages”](#reliable-message-processing-of-incoming-messages) on the duplicate message.

    4.  Otherwise, update the Message Reception State as detailed in [Section 4.6.5.1, “Message](#message-reception-state) [Reception State”](#message-reception-state), and accept the message for further processing.

## Message Processing

> This sub-clause describes the fundamental procedures for transmission and reception.

### Message Transmission

> To prepare a message for transmission with a given Session ID, Destination Node ID (which may be a [group node id](#group-node-id) or an [operational node id](#operational-node-id)) and Security Flags, the following steps SHALL be per­ formed, in order:

1.  Process the message as described in [Section 4.6.6, “Counter Processing of Outgoing Messages”](#counter-processing-of-outgoing-messages).

2.  If the message’s [Session Type](#_bookmark230) is a [Unicast Session](#_bookmark230):

    1.  Set [SessionTimestamp](#secure-session-context) to a timestamp from a clock which would allow for the eventual deter­ mination of the last session use relative to other sessions.

    2.  Process the message as described in [Section 4.8.2, “Security Processing of Outgoing Mes­](#security-processing-of-outgoing-messages) [sages”](#security-processing-of-outgoing-messages).

    3.  Process the message as described in [Section 4.9.3, “Privacy Processing of Outgoing Mes­](#privacy-processing-of-outgoing-messages) [sages”](#privacy-processing-of-outgoing-messages).

### Message Reception

> To process a received message, the following steps SHALL be performed in order:

1.  Perform validity checks on the message; if any fail, processing of the message SHALL stop, and a 'message invalid' error SHOULD be indicated to the next higher layer:

    1.  The [Version](#_bookmark222) field SHALL be 0.

    2.  If the message is of [Secure Unicast Session Type](#_bookmark230):

        1.  The [DSIZ](#_bookmark224) field SHALL NOT indicate a Group ID is present.

    3.  If the message is of [Group Session Type](#_bookmark230):

        1.  The [DSIZ](#_bookmark224) field SHALL NOT be 0.

        2.  The [S Flag](#_bookmark223) field SHALL NOT be 0.

2.  If the message is NOT of [Unsecured Session Type](#_bookmark230):

    1.  Obtain the Privacy and Encryption Keys associated with the given Session ID:

        1.  If no keys are found, security processing SHALL indicate a failure to the next higher layer with a status of 'message security failed' and no further security processing SHALL be done on this message.

    2.  For each Privacy and Encryption Key, of which there may be more than one in the case of group messages:

        1.  If the [P Flag](#_bookmark227) is set, follow [Section 4.9.4, “Privacy Processing of Incoming Messages”](#privacy-processing-of-incoming-messages) to deobfuscate the message.

        2.  Follow [Section 4.8.3, “Security Processing of Incoming Messages”](#security-processing-of-incoming-messages) to decrypt and authen­ ticate the message.

3.  Follow [Section 4.6.7, “Counter Processing of Incoming Messages”](#counter-processing-of-incoming-messages) to enforce replay protection and duplicate detection.

4.  If the message transport is UDP, follow [Section 4.12.5.2, “Reliable Message Processing of Incom­](#reliable-message-processing-of-incoming-messages) [ing Messages”](#reliable-message-processing-of-incoming-messages) to process message reliability.

5.  If the message’s [Session Type](#_bookmark230) is a [Unicast Session](#_bookmark230):

    1.  Set [SessionTimestamp and ActiveTimestamp](#secure-session-context) to a timestamp from a clock which would allow for the eventual determination of the last session use relative to other sessions.

6.  The received message is then delivered to [Section 4.10.5, “Exchange Message Processing”](#exchange-message-processing).

## Message Security

> The detailed steps involved in security processing of outgoing and incoming Matter messages are described in [Section 4.8.2, “Security Processing of Outgoing Messages”](#security-processing-of-outgoing-messages) and [Section 4.8.3, “Security](#security-processing-of-incoming-messages) [Processing of Incoming Messages”](#security-processing-of-incoming-messages) respectively. [Section 4.8.1, “Data confidentiality and integrity](#data-confidentiality-and-integrity-with-data-origin-authentication-parameters) [with data origin authentication parameters”](#data-confidentiality-and-integrity-with-data-origin-authentication-parameters) defines how the cryptographic parameters are set for securing Matter messages.

### Data confidentiality and integrity with data origin authentication parameters

> This section specifies the parameters to use the data confidentiality and integrity cryptographic primitive as defined in [Section 3.6, “Data Confidentiality and Integrity”](#data-confidentiality-and-integrity).
>
> The parameters in this section SHALL apply for all encrypted messages, i.e. all messages except those of [Unsecured Session Type](#_bookmark230).

#### Nonce

> The nonce SHALL be formatted as specified in [Table 17, “Nonce”](#_bookmark284).
>
> *Table 17. Nonce*

| **Octets: 1**  | **4**           | **8**          |
|----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Security Flags | Message Counter | Source Node ID |

> The nonce used for the Authenticated Encryption with Additional Data (AEAD) algorithm (see [Sec­](#data-confidentiality-and-integrity) [tion 3.6, “Data Confidentiality and Integrity”](#data-confidentiality-and-integrity)) for a given message SHALL be defined as the concate­ nation of the Security Flags, the Message Counter, and the Source Node ID of that message. The scalar fields in the nonce, namely the Message Counter and the Source Node ID SHALL be encoded in little-endian byte order for the purposes of serialization within the nonce, that is, in the same byte ordering as the segment of the message from which its data originates.
>
> The Source Node ID field used in the nonce SHALL be set to the [Operational Node ID](#operational-node-id) of the node originating security protection of the message:

- If the message is of [Secure Unicast Session Type](#_bookmark230):

  - For a [CASE](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case) session, the Nonce Source Node ID SHALL be determined via the [Secure Session](#secure-session-context) [Context](#secure-session-context) associated with the Session Identifier.

  - For a [PASE](#passcode-authenticated-session-establishment-pase) session, the Nonce Source Node ID SHALL be [Unspecified Node ID](#unspecified-node-id).

- If the message is of [Group Session Type](#_bookmark230):

  - The [S Flag](#_bookmark223) of the message SHALL be 1 and the Nonce Source Node ID SHALL be the [Source](#source-node-id-64-bits) [Node ID](#source-node-id-64-bits) of the message.

  - If the [S Flag](#_bookmark223) of the message is 0 the message SHALL be dropped.

#### NOTE

> Because PASE negotiates strong one-time keys per session and the [I2RKey](#_bookmark389) and [R2IKey](#_bookmark389) are distinct for each direction of communication, the use of the [Unspecified Node ID](#unspecified-node-id) as the Nonce Source Node ID remains semantically secure.

### Security Processing of Outgoing Messages

> The process for encrypting Matter messages is depicted graphically in [Figure 8, “Matter Message](#_bookmark286) [Encryption”](#_bookmark286) with color code conventions described in [Figure 9, “Matter Message Encryption Leg­](#_bookmark287) [end”](#_bookmark287).

>
> To prepare a secure message for transmission with a given Session ID, Destination Node ID (which may be a [group node id](#group-node-id) or an [operational node id](#operational-node-id)) and Security Flags, the Node SHALL perform the following steps:

1.  Obtain the Encryption Key associated with the Session ID and Destination Node ID and the Ses­ sion Type associated with the Destination Node ID:

    1.  If no key is found for the given Session ID, security processing SHALL fail and no further security processing SHALL be done on this message.

2.  Obtain the outgoing message counter of the sending Node as per [Section 4.6.6, “Counter Process­](#counter-processing-of-outgoing-messages)

> [ing of Outgoing Messages”](#counter-processing-of-outgoing-messages).

3.  Set the Security fields as follows:

    1.  The [Session ID](#session-id-16-bits) field SHALL be set to the value provided to step 1.

    2.  The [Security Flags](#security-flags-8-bits) field SHALL be set to the value provided to step 1 with the following sub­ fields updated:

        1.  The [Session Type](#_bookmark230) field SHALL be set to the value obtained from step 1.

4.  Set the [Message Flags](#message-flags-8-bits), [Destination Node ID](#destination-node-id), and [Source Node ID](#source-node-id-64-bits) fields as follows:

    1.  If the Session Type is a unicast session:

        1.  Set [S Flag](#_bookmark223) to 0.

        2.  Set [DSIZ](#_bookmark224) to 0.

        3.  Omit both [Destination Node ID](#destination-node-id), and [Source Node ID](#source-node-id-64-bits).

    2.  Else if the [Session Type](#_bookmark230) is a group session:

        1.  Set [S Flag](#_bookmark223) to 1.

        2.  Set [DSIZ](#_bookmark224) to 2.

        3.  Set [Source Node ID](#source-node-id-64-bits) field to the [operational node id](#operational-node-id) of the sending node.

        4.  Set [Destination Node ID](#destination-node-id) field to the 16-bit Group ID derived from the Destination Node ID.

5.  Set the [Message Counter](#message-counter-32-bits) field to the outgoing message counter from step 2.

6.  Execute the AEAD generate and encrypt operation, as specified in [Section 3.6.1, “Generate and](#generate-and-encrypt) [encrypt”](#generate-and-encrypt), with the following instantiations:

    1.  The bit string key *K* SHALL be the Encryption Key obtained from step 1;

    2.  The nonce *N* SHALL be the CRYPTO_AEAD_NONCE_LENGTH_BYTES-octet string constructed accord­ ing to [Table 17, “Nonce”](#_bookmark284);

    3.  The parameter *P* SHALL be the Message Payload;

    4.  The additional data octet string *A* SHALL be the Message Header contents, using little-endian byte order for all scalars, exactly as they appear in the message segments from which they originate:

> with the optional fields appended according to the Message Flags:

5.  C = Crypto_AEAD_GenerateEncrypt(K, P, A, N)

&nbsp;

7.  If the AEAD operation invoked in step 6 results in an error, then security processing SHALL fail and no further security processing SHALL be done on this message.

8.  Let *C* be the output from step 6. *C* contains the tag of CRYPTO_AEAD_MIC_LENGTH_BITS bits (Message

> Integrity Check (MIC)) as specified by [Section 3.6.1, “Generate and encrypt”](#generate-and-encrypt). The secured outgo­ ing message SHALL be:

### Security Processing of Incoming Messages

> All incoming message processing SHALL occur in a serialized manner. If an implementation chooses to process messages in a parallel manner, it must ensure that the behavior is opaque-box identical to a serialized processing implementation.
>
> If the transport layer receives a secured message as indicated by the Session ID, it SHALL perform the following steps:

1.  Determine the [Session Type](#_bookmark230), [Session ID](#session-id-16-bits), and [Message Counter](#message-counter-32-bits) from the message header of the received message.

2.  Obtain the Encryption Key associated with the [Session Context](#secure-session-context) of the given Session ID and Ses­ sion Type:

    1.  If no key is found for the given Session ID, security processing SHALL indicate a failure to the next higher layer with a status of 'message security failed' and no further security pro­ cessing SHALL be done on this message.

3.  Execute the AEAD decryption and verification operation as specified in [Section 3.6.2, “Decrypt](#decrypt-and-verify) [and verify”](#decrypt-and-verify) with the following instantiations:

    1.  The bit string key *K* SHALL be the Encryption Key obtained from step 2;

    2.  The nonce *N* SHALL be the CRYPTO_AEAD_NONCE_LENGTH_BYTES-octet string constructed accord­ ing to [Table 17, “Nonce”](#_bookmark284);

    3.  The parameter *C* SHALL be the encrypted and authenticated Message Payload;

    4.  The additional data octet string *A* SHALL be the authenticated Message Header:

    5.  {success, P} = Crypto_AEAD_DecryptVerify(K, C, A, N)

4.  Return the result {success, P} of the AEAD operation:

    1.  If the success is FALSE, security processing SHALL fail and further processing SHALL NOT be performed on this message. An appropriate error SHOULD be raised to the upper layer to indicate the error.

    2.  Otherwise, set the octet string *PlaintextMessage* to the string

5.  *PlaintextMessage* now represents the deciphered, authenticated, received message.

    1.  NOTE: The message has not yet undergone counter processing nor replay detection.

    2.  The *PlaintextMessage* SHALL be marked as successfully security processed and SHALL be released to the next processing layer.

## Message Privacy

> Privacy processing of a message describes the obfuscation and deobfuscation of the message header fields after encryption and before decryption.
>
> The detailed steps involved in privacy processing of outgoing and incoming Matter messages are described in [Section 4.9.3, “Privacy Processing of Outgoing Messages”](#privacy-processing-of-outgoing-messages) and [Section 4.9.4, “Privacy](#privacy-processing-of-incoming-messages) [Processing of Incoming Messages”](#privacy-processing-of-incoming-messages) respectively. They rely on the cryptographic primitives in [Section](#message-privacy) [3.7, “Message privacy”](#message-privacy).

### Privacy Key

> The Privacy Key is a symmetric key specifically used for [Privacy Processing](#privacy-processing-of-outgoing-messages) that is derived from the EncryptionKey used for [Security Processing](#security-processing-of-outgoing-messages) of a given message. Given a Session ID reference to a specific Encryption Key, the Privacy Key is derived as follows:

[TABLE]

### Privacy Nonce

> The Privacy Nonce is a nonce specifically used for [Privacy Processing](#privacy-processing-of-outgoing-messages) that is derived from the Ses­ sionId and MIC of the message. The Privacy Nonce SHALL be the CRYPTO_AEAD_NONCE_LENGTH_BYTES
>
> -octet string constructed as the 16-bit Session ID (in big-endian format) concatenated with the lower 11 (i.e. CRYPTO_AEAD_MIC_LENGTH_BYTES-5) bytes of the MIC:

[TABLE]

> For example if Session ID is 42 (i.e. 0x002A) and the computed MIC is
>
> c5:a0:06:3a:d5:d2:51:81:91:40:0d:d6:8c:5c:16:3b:

### Privacy Processing of Outgoing Messages

> The process for privacy encoding Matter message headers is depicted graphically in [Figure 10,](#_bookmark293) [“Matter Message Privacy”](#_bookmark293).

![](media/image12.png)

> *Figure 10. Matter Message Privacy*
>
> To apply privacy obfuscation to an encrypted message prepared for transmission by [Section 4.7.1,](#message-transmission) [“Message Transmission”](#message-transmission), apply obfuscation steps as follows:

1.  If [P Flag](#_bookmark227) is not set, do nothing.

2.  Obtain the Privacy Key for the Encryption Key used to secure the message.

3.  Execute the encryption operation as specified in [Section 3.7.1, “Privacy encryption”](#privacy-encryption) with the fol­ lowing instantiations:

    1.  The bit string key *K* SHALL be the Privacy Key obtained from step 1;

    2.  The MIC SHALL be the last CRYPTO_AEAD_MIC_LENGTH_BYTES bytes of the C outcome of the mes­ sage security protection as specified in [Section 4.8.2, “Security Processing of Outgoing Mes­](#security-processing-of-outgoing-messages) [sages”](#security-processing-of-outgoing-messages) (MIC = C\[(CRYPTO_AEAD_MIC_LENGTH_BYTES-1)..0\])

    3.  The nonce *N* SHALL be the [PrivacyNonce](#privacy-nonce) of the message.

    4.  The parameter *M* SHALL be the message header fields where optional fields are only present in *M* if they are present in the message:

    5.  CP = Crypto_Privacy_Encrypt(K, M, N)

4.  Let *CP* be the obfuscated output from step 2. *CP* SHALL be used in the final private message in place of the message header fields.

### Privacy Processing of Incoming Messages

> To deobfuscate a private message received by [Section 4.7.2, “Message Reception”](#message-reception) with a given Pri­ vacy Key, perform security processing as follows:

1.  If [P Flag](#_bookmark227) is not set, do nothing.

2.  With the given Privacy Key, execute the decryption as specified in [Section 3.7.2, “Privacy decryp­](#privacy-decryption) [tion”](#privacy-decryption) with the following instantiations:

    1.  The bit string key *K* SHALL be the Privacy Key obtained from step 1;

    2.  The MIC SHALL be the last CRYPTO_AEAD_MIC_LENGTH_BYTES bytes of the C outcome of the mes­ sage security protection as specified in [Section 4.8.3, “Security Processing of Incoming Mes­](#security-processing-of-incoming-messages) [sages”](#security-processing-of-incoming-messages) (MIC = C\[(CRYPTO_AEAD_MIC_LENGTH_BYTES-1)..0\])

    3.  The nonce *N* SHALL be the [PrivacyNonce](#privacy-nonce) of the message.

    4.  The parameter *CP* SHALL be the message header fields where optional fields are only present in *CP* if they are present in the message:

    5.  M = Crypto_Privacy_Decrypt(K, CP, N)

3.  Let *M* be the deobfuscated output from step 2.

    1.  *M* SHALL be used in the final private message in place of the message header fields.

    2.  The first successfully validated message, *M*, by [Section 4.8.3, “Security Processing of Incom­](#security-processing-of-incoming-messages) [ing Messages”](#security-processing-of-incoming-messages) SHALL terminate iteration through Privacy Keys in step 2.

## Message Exchanges

> An Exchange provides a way to group related messages together, organize communication flows, and enable higher levels of the communication stack to track semantically relevant groupings of messages.
>
> An Exchange SHALL be bound to exactly one underlying session that will transport all associated Exchange messages for the life of that Exchange. The underlying session SHALL be one of the fol­ lowing session types: [secure unicast](#secure-session-context) (as established by PASE or CASE), [unsecured](#unsecured-session-context) (as is used for the initial session establishment phase of a PASE/CASE session), [secure group](#groupcast-session-context), or [MCSP](#message-counter-synchronization-session-context).
>
> When used with [reliability](#message-reliability-protocol-mrp), Exchanges assume basic flow control by the upper layer. The Exchange Layer SHALL NOT accept a message from the upper layer when there is an outbound reliable mes­ sage pending on the same Exchange.

### Exchange Role

> The first Node to send a message in an Exchange is said to be in the Initiator role, and all the other Nodes that subsequently participate in the Exchange are said to be in a Responder role. An Exchange is always between one Initiator and one or more peer Responder Nodes. An Exchange
>
> does not survive a reboot of one of the participants. Adjacent layers MAY close an Exchange at any time.

### Exchange ID

> An Exchange of messages is identified by the Exchange ID field described in [Section 4.4.3.3,](#exchange-id-16-bits) [“Exchange ID (16 bits)”](#exchange-id-16-bits). The Exchange ID is allocated by the Initiator. The first message the Initiator sends in a new Exchange SHALL contain a fresh value for the Exchange ID field. The Exchange is then identified by the tuple {Session Context, [Exchange ID](#exchange-id), [Exchange Role](#exchange-role)} where Session Context is one of an [Unsecured](#unsecured-session-context), [Secured](#secure-session-context), [Groupcast](#groupcast-session-context) or [MCSP](#message-counter-synchronization-session-context) session context. All messages that are part of a given Exchange, whether they are sent by the Initiator or not, share the same Exchange ID, allow­ ing the Initiator and Responder Nodes to match responses to requests or otherwise group messages together that are part of more complex transactions. The first Exchange ID for a given Initiator Node SHALL be a random integer. All subsequent Exchange IDs created by that Initiator SHALL be the last Exchange ID it created incremented by one. An Exchange ID is an unsigned integer that rolls over to zero when its maximum value is exceeded.

### Exchange Context

> An Exchange context is the metadata tracked for an Exchange by all exchange participants. An Exchange context tracks the following data:

1.  Exchange ID: The Exchange ID assigned by the Initiator

2.  Exchange Role: Initiator or Responder

3.  Session Context: The underlying [Unsecured](#unsecured-session-context), [Secured](#secure-session-context), [Groupcast](#groupcast-session-context) or [MCSP](#message-counter-synchronization-session-context) session context

    - Together, Session Context, Exchange ID and Role comprise a unique key allowing partici­ pants to identify any exchange.

#### 4.10.3.1. Protocol ID Registration

> The Interaction Model layer indicates to the Exchange Layer which [Protocols](#protocol-id-16-bits) it will accept. Any message for a [Protocol ID](#protocol-id-16-bits) that is not registered with the Exchange Layer SHALL be dropped.

### Exchange Message Dispatch

> When sending a message to the Exchange Layer, the next higher layer SHALL specify whether the message is part of an existing Exchange, or the first of a new Exchange. For the case of a first mes­ sage, the Initiator creates a new Exchange. The Node in the Initiator role SHALL always set the [I](#_bookmark240) [Flag](#_bookmark240) in the [Exchange Flags](#exchange-flags-8-bits) of every message it sends in that Exchange.
>
> Each Node in a Responder role for an Exchange SHALL use the Exchange ID received in previous messages for the Exchange. Each Node in the Responder role SHALL NOT set the [I Flag](#_bookmark240) in the [Exchange Flags](#exchange-flags-8-bits) of every message it sends in that Exchange. Each Node in a Responder role SHALL NOT set the [Destination Node ID](#destination-node-id) field to a value that identifies any Node other than the Node in the Initiator role for the Exchange.
>
> Processing SHALL then proceed to [Section 4.12.5.1, “Reliable Message Processing of Outgoing Mes­](#reliable-message-processing-of-outgoing-messages) [sages”](#reliable-message-processing-of-outgoing-messages).

### Exchange Message Processing

> After completion of [Section 4.7.2, “Message Reception”](#message-reception), if the message [matches an existing](#exchange-message-matching) [Exchange](#exchange-message-matching), it is dispatched to the appropriate protocol handler in the next higher layer. Messages for an existing Exchange are dispatched to the handler for that Exchange. Otherwise, the [unso­](#unsolicited-message-processing) [licited message](#unsolicited-message-processing) that created the Exchange is dispatched to the unsolicited message handler.

#### Exchange Message Matching

> Upon receipt of a message, the Exchange Layer attempts to match the message to an existing [Exchange](#message-exchanges-1). A given message is part of an Exchange if it satisfies all the following criteria:

1.  The message was received over the session associated with the Exchange.

2.  The Exchange ID of the message matches the Exchange ID of the Exchange,

3.  The message has the [I Flag](#_bookmark240) set and the Exchange Role of the Exchange is Responder,

> OR the message does not have the [I Flag](#_bookmark240) set and the Exchange Role of the Exchange is Initiator.
>
> If the message does not match an existing Exchange, the message is considered an [unsolicited mes­](#unsolicited-message-processing) [sage](#unsolicited-message-processing).

#### Unsolicited Message Processing

> An unsolicited message is processed as follows:

4.  If the unsolicited message is not marked as having a duplicate message counter, has a registered [Protocol ID](#protocol-id-16-bits), and the [I Flag](#_bookmark240) is set:

    1.  Create a [new exchange](#_bookmark303) from the incoming message.

    2.  The new exchange will be used by the upper layer for generating responses and subsequent processing of the message.

5.  Otherwise, if the message has the [R Flag](#_bookmark242) set:

    1.  Create an *[ephemeral exchange](#_bookmark303)* from the incoming message and send an immediate stand­ alone acknowledgement.

    2.  The message SHALL NOT be forwarded to the upper layer, and excluding the sending of an immediate standalone acknowledgment, SHALL be ignored.

    3.  The *ephemeral exchange* created for such duplicate or unknown messages with [R Flag](#_bookmark242) set is automatically closed in [Section 4.12.5.2.2, “Standalone acknowledgement processing”](#_bookmark332).

6.  Otherwise, processing of the message SHALL stop.

> **Creating an Exchange based on an Incoming Message**
>
> The steps to create a new Exchange based on an incoming message are as follows:

1.  A new Exchange and [Exchange Context](#exchange-context) SHALL be created with the following settings:

    1.  The Exchange ID SHALL be set to the Exchange ID of the message.

    2.  The Exchange Role SHALL be set to the inverse of the incoming message [I Flag](#_bookmark240), for example set the Exchange Role to Responder if the message is from an Initiator.

    3.  The Session Context SHALL be set to the Session on which the message was received.

> A node SHOULD limit itself to a maximum of 5 concurrent exchanges over a unicast session. This is to prevent a node from exhausting the message counter window of the peer node.

#### Closing an Exchange

> An Exchange MAY be closed by the application layer or a fatal connection error from the lower message layer. The process of closing an Exchange follows:

1.  Any pending acknowledgements associated with the Exchange SHALL be flushed. If there is a pending acknowledgment in the *[acknowledgement table](#acknowledgement-table)* for the Exchange and it has Stand­ aloneAckSent set to false:

    1.  Immediately send a [standalone acknowledgement](#mrp-standalone-acknowledgement) for the pending acknowledgement.

    2.  Remove the [*acknowledgement table*](#acknowledgement-table) entry for the pending acknowledgement.

2.  Wait for all pending retransmissions associated with the Exchange to complete.

    1.  If the retransmission list for the Exchange is empty, remove the Exchange.

    2.  Otherwise, leave the Exchange open and only close it once the retransmission list is empty.

> These steps are depicted in [Figure 11, “Exchange close flow”](#_bookmark305).

## Secure Channel Protocol

> This section specifies the formal protocol definition for the Secure Channel Protocol. Secure Chan­ nel Protocol defines the control plane for secure channel communication and security.

### Secure Channel Protocol Messages

> Secure Channel Protocol is composed of a collection of sub-protocols, including:

- Message Counter Synchronization Protocol (MCSP)

- Message Reliability Protocol (MRP)

- Passcode Based Session Establishment (PASE)

- Certificate Based Session Establishment (CASE)

> The protocol opcodes for messages within the Secure Channel Protocol are grouped based on the underlying sub-protocol that uses the message type. [Table 18, “Secure Channel Protocol Opcodes”](#_bookmark308) lists the messages defined by Secure Channel Protocol.
>
> *Table 18. Secure Channel Protocol Opcodes*

[TABLE]

[TABLE]

#### Session Establishment - Out of Resources

> After a successful session establishment using [CASE](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case) or [PASE](#passcode-authenticated-session-establishment-pase), a responder may not have enough resources to save all of the [session context information](#secure-session-context). To free resources, a responder SHALL evict an existing session using the following procedure:

1.  Use the [SessionTimestamp](#secure-session-context) to determine the least-recently used session.

2.  Determine the session that was least-recently used then:

    1.  Send a [status report](#secure-channel-status-report-messages): StatusReport(GeneralCode: SUCCESS, ProtocolId: [SECURE_CHANNEL](#_bookmark249), Pro­ tocolCode: [CLOSE_SESSION](#_bookmark314)) message to the peer node

    2.  Remove all state associated with the session (see [Section 4.13.3.1, “Secure Session Context”](#secure-session-context)). The Node MAY save state necessary to perform [Session Resumption](#session-resumption), see [Section 4.14.2.2.1,](#_bookmark366) [“Session Resumption State”](#_bookmark366) for more details.

3.  Respond to the initiator with the appropriate session establishment message

#### Status Report

> The Status Report message is sent from protocol handlers to convey the status of an operation using a common format as defined in [Appendix D, *Status Report Messages*](#appendix-d-status-report-messages). The *StatusReport* message is a part of the Secure Channel protocol, but embeds an additional context-specific ProtocolID field in its message-specific payload. In this way, the *StatusReport* can convey status for any protocol han­ dler.

#### Secure Channel Status Report Messages

> Status Reports specific to the Secure Channel are designated by embedding the [PROTOCOL_ID_SE­](#_bookmark249) [CURE_CHANNEL](#_bookmark249) in the ProtocolId field of the *StatusReport* body. All Secure Channel Status Report Mes­ sages SHALL use the [PROTOCOL_ID_SECURE_CHANNEL](#_bookmark249) protocol id. For example, a failure to find a com­ mon root of trust may be written in the specification as follows: StatusReport(GeneralCode: FAILURE, ProtocolId: [SECURE_CHANNEL](#_bookmark249), ProtocolCode: [NO_SHARED_TRUST_ROOTS](#_bookmark312)).
>
> There are several cases for which the secure channel layer may emit a status report:

4.  To indicate successful session establishment

5.  In response to errors during session establishment

6.  In response to errors after session establishment

7.  To indicate that a Node is terminating a session

> For each of these cases, a Secure Channel [Status Report](#appendix-d-status-report-messages) message SHALL be sent with an appropriate
>
> ProtocolCode as detailed below.
>
> The following table describes the Secure Channel Status Report [Protocol Specific](#_bookmark1998) codes. Each entry in the list details the appropriate [General Code](#_bookmark1997) to be utilized with the message and whether it may be sent unencrypted. Secure Channel Status Report messages which are marked as encrypted below SHALL only be sent encrypted in a session established with [CASE](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case) or [PASE](#passcode-authenticated-session-establishment-pase).
>
> *Table 19. Secure Channel Protocol Codes*

[TABLE]

#### CloseSession

> A node may choose to close a session for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, the fol­ lowing:

8.  The interaction between nodes is complete

9.  The node needs to free up resources for a new session

10. Fabric configuration associated with the [CASE](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case) session was removed with the [RemoveFabric](#removefabric-command) [command](#removefabric-command) invoked by an Administrator while the session was open

> The CloseSession StatusReport SHALL only be sent encrypted within an exchange associated with a [PASE](#passcode-authenticated-session-establishment-pase) or [CASE](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case) session. The CloseSession StatusReport SHALL be sent within a new exchange and SHALL NOT set the [R Flag](#_bookmark242).
>
> If a Node has either sent or received a CloseSession StatusReport, that Node SHALL remove all state associated with the session (see [Section 4.13.3.1, “Secure Session Context”](#secure-session-context)). The Node MAY save state necessary to perform [Session Resumption](#session-resumption), see [Section 4.14.2.2.1, “Session Resumption State”](#_bookmark366) for more details.

#### Busy

> When a receiver receives a request to start a new secure session via a [Sigma1](#_bookmark367) or [PBKDFParamRe­](#_bookmark351) [quest](#_bookmark351) message, the receiver MAY respond with the [BUSY](#_bookmark315) [StatusReport](#secure-channel-status-report-messages) when it is unable to fulfill the request. The [BUSY](#_bookmark315) StatusReport SHALL:

11. Set the [R Flag](#_bookmark242) to 0

12. Set the [S Flag](#_bookmark223) to 0

13. Set the [StatusReport](#secure-channel-status-report-messages) ProtocolData to a 16-bit (two byte) little-endian value indicating the mini­ mum time in milliseconds to wait before retrying the original request.

14. Set the [Exchange ID](#exchange-id) to the *Exchange ID* present in the [Sigma1](#_bookmark367) or [PBKDFParamRequest](#_bookmark351) message which triggered this response.

> For example, a responder wishing to indicate they are unable to fulfill the request and that the ini­ tiator should wait 500 milliseconds before trying again would send StatusReport(GeneralCode: BUSY, ProtocolId: [SECURE_CHANNEL](#_bookmark249), ProtocolCode: [BUSY](#_bookmark315), ProtocolData: \[0xF4, 0x01\]).
>
> The [BUSY](#_bookmark315) StatusReport SHALL NOT be sent in response to any message except for [Sigma1](#_bookmark367) or [PBKDFParamRequest](#_bookmark351).
>
> An initiator receiving a [BUSY](#_bookmark315) StatusReport from a responder SHALL wait for at least a period of t milliseconds before retrying the request where t is the value obtained from the Busy StatusReport ProtocolData field.
>
> If the initiator sends a new session establishment request after receiving a [BUSY](#_bookmark315) StatusReport, the request SHALL contain new values for all randomized parameters.

### Parameters and Constants

> [Table 20, “Glossary of constants”](#_bookmark319) is a glossary of constants used in the secure channel protocol, along with a brief description and the default for each constant.
>
> *Table 20. Glossary of constants*

| **Constant Name** | **Description** | **Value** |
|----|----|----|
| MSG_COUNTER_WINDOW_SIZE | Maximum number of previously processed mes­ sage counters to accept from a given Node and key. | 32 |
| MSG_COUNTER_SYNC_REQ_JIT­ TER | Maximum amount of random delay before send­ ing a *MsgCounterSyncReq* when the synchroniza­ tion request is triggered by receipt of a multicast message. | 500 millisec­ onds |
| MSG_COUNTER_SYNC_TIMEOUT | The maximum amount of time (in milliseconds) which a Node SHALL wait for a *MsgCounterSyn­ cRsp* after sending a *MsgCounterSyncReq*. | 400 millisec­ onds |

## Message Reliability Protocol (MRP)

> The Message Reliability Protocol (MRP) provides confirmation of delivery for messages that require reliability. The protocol is optimized for constrained devices that may not be able to receive a mes­ sage at the point it is due to be delivered to them. Reliable messaging MAY be enabled on an indi­ vidual message basis as required by the protocol design of the higher layer application. Reliability is achieved through time-bounded delivery confirmation, ensuring best effort delivery of critical messages over what may be an inherently lossy and unreliable communication medium.
>
> Flow control mechanisms are not incorporated in MRP because it is intended to be used for short interactions with small numbers of messages in them.

### Reliable Messaging Header Fields

> The following fields are defined in the [Exchange Flags](#exchange-flags-8-bits) for use exclusively by MRP:

- [R Flag](#_bookmark242)

> Indicates a reliable message. This flag SHALL be set by the sender when a message being sent requires the receiver to send back an acknowledgment. To support unreliable messages, this flag bit MAY be clear, so that no acknowledgements are requested from the receiver.

- [A Flag](#_bookmark241)

> Indicates the message is acting as an acknowledgement. This flag MAY be set on any message. When set, the *Acknowledged Message Counter* field SHALL be present and valid. This flag SHALL always be set for *MRP Standalone Acknowledgement* messages.

- [Acknowledged Message Counter](#acknowledged-message-counter-32-bits)

> This field SHALL be set to the Message Counter of the message that is being acknowledged.

### Reliable transfer

> When the reliability bit is set, the *reliable message* is transmitted at most *[MRP_MAX_TRANSMIS­](#_bookmark340)* [*SIONS*](#_bookmark340) times until an acknowledgement of receipt is received from the peer or a timeout.

#### Retransmissions

> Senders provide an automatic retransmission mechanism for reliable messages. In order for the receiver to receive a message reliably, the sender SHALL trigger the automatic retry mechanism after a period of *mrpBackoffTime* milliseconds without receiving an acknowledgement, where *mrp­ BackoffTime* is calculated according to the formula below. The sender SHALL retry up to a config­ ured maximum number of times (*MRP_MAX_TRANSMISSIONS* - 1) before giving up and notifying the application.
>
> Messages sent to a Node can be lost for various reasons such as lossy network or insufficient buffer space at the receiver. In the case of [Intermittently Connected Devices](#intermittently-connected-device-icd), which are active infrequently to receive messages destined for them, a sender must be aware of the characteristics of the recipi­ ent to ensure it does not attempt to send at a rate beyond the recipient’s capability. Therefore, the
>
> sender SHALL choose retransmission timeouts based on the [session characteristics](#_bookmark343) of the destina­ tion Node exposed via [Section 4.3.2, “Operational Discovery”](#operational-discovery).
>
> At each sender, a retransmission timer is started each time a reliable message is transmitted. The duration of the retransmission timer SHALL be calculated as follows:

[TABLE]

> Where:

[TABLE]

> For each unique Exchange, the sender SHALL wait for the acknowledgement message until the retransmission timer, *mrpBackoffTime*, expires.
>
> When waiting for an acknowledgement, an [Intermittently Connected Device](#intermittently-connected-device-icd) will always be in [Active Mode](#_bookmark1090) since it will have at least one active exchange. An [Intermittently Connected Device](#intermittently-connected-device-icd) sender SHOULD increase the *mrpBackoffTime* by its [fast polling interval](#fast-polling) to take into account the delay that might happen in receiving the acknowledgment while in [Active Mode](#_bookmark1090).
>
> For the first message of a new exchange, the base interval, i, SHALL be set according to the active state of the peer node as stored in the Session Context of the session (either the [Secure Session Con­](#secure-session-context) [text](#secure-session-context) or the [Unsecured Session Context](#unsecured-session-context) depending on the Session Type). For all subsequent messages of the exchange, the base interval, i, SHOULD be set according to the active state of the peer node as stored in the Session Context of the session (either the [Secure Session Context](#secure-session-context) or the [Unsecured Ses­](#unsecured-session-context) [sion Context](#unsecured-session-context) depending on the Session Type), unless the sender has other means to determine whether the device is active or idle. The backoff base interval SHALL be set to a value at least 10% greater than the idle interval of the destination:

- If PeerActiveMode in the Session Context is true:

  - i = SESSION_ACTIVE_INTERVAL of the peer

- Else the peer is in idle mode:

  - i = SESSION_IDLE_INTERVAL of the peer

- i = MRP_BACKOFF_MARGIN \* i

> The *MRP_BACKOFF_THRESHOLD* parameter creates a two-phase scheme which begins with linear backoff to improve initial latency when congestion is not the cause of packet drops, and then transi­ tions to exponential backoff to provide convergence when the network is congested. If a positive acknowledgment is received before the retransmission timer expires, the retransmission timer is stopped. Otherwise, if the retransmission timer expires, the message is retransmitted and the timer started again.

> The sender SHOULD initiate [Section 4.3.2, “Operational Discovery”](#operational-discovery) in parallel with the first retry to re-resolve the address of the destination Node if the initial transmission fails after one expected round trip. The sender SHOULD use the latest MRP parameters for the destination that result from subsequent Operational Discovery.
>
> When a client is communicating with an [ICD](#intermittently-connected-device-icd) (i.e. the [ICD Management cluster](#icd-management-cluster) is present), the sender SHALL initiate [Section 4.3.2, “Operational Discovery”](#operational-discovery) in parallel with the first retry to re- resolve the address of the destination Node if the initial transmission fails after one expected round trip. The sender SHALL use the latest MRP parameters for the destination that result from subse­ quent Operational Discovery.

#### Acknowledgements

> A receiver SHALL acknowledge a reliable message by either using a "piggybacked" acknowledg­ ment in the next message destined to the peer, or a standalone acknowledgment, or both.
>
> The acknowledgement message SHALL set the *Acknowledged Message Counter* field to the value of the *Message Counter* of the reliable message to be acknowledged.
>
> **Piggybacking Acknowledgments on Responses**
>
> Acknowledgements MAY be conveyed at the same time (i.e. piggybacked) as data in a response mes­ sage. The receiver tries to optimize message transmission by deferring acknowledgments when a reliable message is received (see [Section 4.12.5.2.2, “Standalone acknowledgement processing”](#_bookmark332)) and piggybacking outstanding acknowledgments on messages that it needs to send back (see [Section](#_bookmark328) [4.12.5.1.1, “Piggyback acknowledgment processing”](#_bookmark328) for more details).

#### Duplicate Message Detection

> Since the reliable messaging protocol has a provision for the sender to retransmit messages, there is a significant chance that a duplicate message may arrive at the receiver. The receiver SHALL detect and mark duplicate messages that it receives using the standard authentication and replay protection mechanisms of the secure message layer (see [Section 4.6.5, “Replay Prevention and](#replay-prevention-and-duplicate-message-detection) [Duplicate Message Detection”](#replay-prevention-and-duplicate-message-detection)). The receiver SHALL send an acknowledgment message to the sender for each instance of an authenticated, reliable message, including duplicates. The reliability layer SHALL only propagate the first instance of a message to the next higher layer. Any message
>
> marked as a duplicate SHALL be dropped by the reliability layer.

### Peer Exchange Management

> The Reliable Messaging Protocol operates within the scope of an [Exchange](#message-exchanges-1) between two Nodes. MRP SHALL support one pending acknowledgement and one pending retransmission per [Exchange](#message-exchanges-1).
>
> MRP control parameters, detailed in [Table 22, “Glossary of MRP parameters”](#_bookmark340), are computed outside of the [Exchange communication](#message-exchanges-1) itself; instead, they are valid for the duration of a secure session. The SESSION_ACTIVE_INTERVAL and SESSION_IDLE_INTERVAL, used in computation of MRP control para­ meters, are determined during [Operational Discovery](#operational-discovery-service-records) or [Section 4.3.1, “Commissionable Node Dis­](#commissionable-node-discovery) [covery”](#commissionable-node-discovery). Additionally, the initiator of a secure session MAY provide these parameters in the initial [CASE Sigma1](#_bookmark367) or [PASE PBKDFParamRequest](#_bookmark351) messages, and the responder MAY provide its parame­ ters in the corresponding protocol messages [CASE Sigma2](#_bookmark371) or [PBKDFParamResponse](#_bookmark354).

### Transport Considerations

> When the upper layer requests a reliable message over a UDP transport, the [R Flag](#_bookmark242) SHALL be set on that message indicating that MRP SHALL be used. Reliable messages sent over TCP or BTP SHALL utilize the underlying reliability mechanisms of those transports and SHOULD NOT set the [R Flag](#_bookmark242).

### Reliable Message Processing

#### Reliable Message Processing of Outgoing Messages

> To prepare a given Protocol Message for transmission, the message SHALL be processed as follows:

1.  Proceed to [Section 4.12.5.1.1, “Piggyback acknowledgment processing”](#_bookmark328).

> **Piggyback acknowledgment processing**

1.  Determine if there is a matching pending acknowledgement in the [*acknowledgement table*](#acknowledgement-table) for the given message by checking all of the following conditions:

    1.  If the Destination Node Id and Exchange Id of the given message and pending acknowledge­ ment are the same

    2.  AND either

        1.  the Session Id and underlying Session Credentials of the given message and pending acknowledgement are the same

        2.  OR both the given message and pending acknowledgement are of [Unsecured Session](#_bookmark230) [Type](#_bookmark230).

2.  If there is a matching pending acknowledgement, the [A Flag](#_bookmark241) SHALL be set on the outbound mes­ sage so it will serve as a piggybacked acknowledgement.

    1.  For such a piggybacked acknowledgement, the *Acknowledgment Message Counter* field SHALL be set to the message counter of the received message for which an acknowledge­ ment was pending.

    2.  If the message being prepared is not a [standalone acknowledgement](#mrp-standalone-acknowledgement), remove the matching entry from the [*acknowledgement table*](#acknowledgement-table).

    3.  If the message being prepared is a [standalone acknowledgement](#mrp-standalone-acknowledgement), set the StandaloneAckSent

> field of the matching entry in the [*acknowledgement table*](#acknowledgement-table) to true.
>
> **Message retransmission processing**

1.  If the outbound message is marked to be delivered reliably over a UDP transport, the [R Flag](#_bookmark242) SHALL be set on the given message to request an acknowledgement from the peer upon receipt.

    1.  Any message flagged for reliable delivery ([R Flag](#_bookmark242) set) SHALL be stored in the *[retransmission](#retransmission-table)* [*table*](#retransmission-table) to track the message until it has been successfully acknowledged by the peer.

2.  Perform [Section 4.7.1, “Message Transmission”](#message-transmission) processing step on the message to send the mes­ sage to the peer:

    1.  The same Session ID, Destination Node ID, Security Flags, and transport as were used for the initial message transmission SHALL be used.

3.  If the transport interface returns an error on the send attempt, the error is assessed to deter­ mine whether the message can be retried.

    1.  If the error is fatal, the application is notified and the message removed from the *retrans­ mission table*.

    2.  If there is no error, or a non-fatal error such as no memory, the message is resent

        1.  Update the [*retransmission table*](#retransmission-table) to reflect the send count.

        2.  Start a retransmission timer to track the maximum time to wait before attempting another retransmission.

        3.  For each retry, the *[retransmission table](#retransmission-table)* is updated to track the number of retries until the maximum number is attempted, at which point the message is evicted from the [*retransmission table*](#retransmission-table).

#### Reliable Message Processing of Incoming Messages

> A message received from [Section 4.7.2, “Message Reception”](#message-reception) for reliability processing SHALL be processed as follows:

1.  Verify the message has a legal combination of reliability flags:

    1.  If the [R Flag](#_bookmark242) is set:

        1.  If [Group Session Type](#_bookmark230) AND [C Flag](#_bookmark228) = 0, drop the message.

    2.  If the [A Flag](#_bookmark241) is set:

        1.  If [Group Session Type](#_bookmark230) AND [C Flag](#_bookmark228) = 0, drop the message.

2.  Proceed to [Section 4.10.5.1, “Exchange Message Matching”](#exchange-message-matching).

3.  Proceed to [Section 4.12.5.2.1, “Received acknowledgement processing”](#_bookmark331).

> **Received acknowledgement processing**

1.  If the [A Flag](#_bookmark241) is set:

> a\. Query the [*retransmission table*](#retransmission-table) for the *Acknowledgement Message Counter* contained in the received message.

1.  If there is a match:

    1.  Remove the entry from the [*retransmission table*](#retransmission-table).

    2.  Stop the retransmission timer for that entry.

2.  If there is no match, it indicates that this is either a duplicate acknowledgment or the [Exchange context](#exchange-context) does not exist.

&nbsp;

2.  Proceed to [Section 4.12.5.2.2, “Standalone acknowledgement processing”](#_bookmark332).

> **Standalone acknowledgement processing**

1.  If the [R Flag](#_bookmark242) is set, the received message is requesting an acknowledgement be sent back:

    1.  If the message is marked as a duplicate:

        1.  Immediately send a [standalone acknowledgment](#mrp-standalone-acknowledgement).

        2.  If the Exchange is marked as an [*ephemeral exchange*](#unsolicited-message-processing) the Exchange SHALL be closed.

        3.  Drop the message.

    2.  Otherwise, instead of sending an acknowledgement immediately upon the receipt of a reli­ able message from a peer, the receiver SHOULD wait for a time no longer than *[MRP_STAND­](#_bookmark340)* [*ALONE_ACK_TIMEOUT*](#_bookmark340) before sending a [standalone acknowledgment](#mrp-standalone-acknowledgement):

        1.  Add the message counter of the received message to the [*acknowledgement table*](#acknowledgement-table) to signal that an outbound acknowledgement is pending. There can be only one outstanding acknowledgement at a time on a single [Exchange](#message-exchanges-1). If a pending acknowledgement already exists for the Exchange, and it has StandaloneAckSent set to false, a [standalone](#mrp-standalone-acknowledgement) [acknowledgment](#mrp-standalone-acknowledgement) SHALL be sent immediately for that pending message counter, and the [*acknowledgement table*](#acknowledgement-table) entry SHALL be replaced for the new message.

        2.  Start the acknowledgement timer for the Exchange.

> A. If the timer triggers before being cancelled, a [standalone acknowledgment](#mrp-standalone-acknowledgement) SHALL be sent to the source of the message. Sending this standalone acknowledgment SHALL NOT remove the [*acknowledgement table*](#acknowledgement-table) entry and SHALL set the StandaloneAckSent field of the entry to true.

2.  The received message is then delivered to the next processing step of [Section 4.7.2, “Message](#message-reception) [Reception”](#message-reception).

### Reliable Message State

#### Retransmission Table

> For retransmissions, the sender maintains a *retransmission table* of context records containing information on all reliable messages sent that have acknowledgments still pending. Each such reli­ able message context record includes the following fields:

- Reference to Exchange Context

- Message Counter

- Reference to fully formed, encoded and encrypted message buffer

- Send count

- Retransmission timeout counter

> Each time a message that requires acknowledgment is sent, a new retransmission context record is inserted into the *retransmission table* or an existing record is updated to increment its send count. The message is sent a configurable maximum number of times (*MRP_MAX_TRANSMISSIONS*) and, if still undelivered, the application is notified of the failure.

#### Acknowledgement Table

> The receiver maintains an *acknowledgement table* of context records containing information on each reliable message for which an acknowledgment SHALL be sent. Each such reliable message context record includes the following fields:

- Reference to Exchange Context

- Message Counter

- A boolean, StandaloneAckSent, indicating whether a [standalone acknowledgement](#mrp-standalone-acknowledgement) has been sent for this message counter. Initially false.

> An entry SHALL remain in the table until one of the following things happens:

1.  The exchange associated with the entry is closed. See [Section 4.10.5.3, “Closing an Exchange”](#closing-an-exchange).

2.  The exchange associated with the entry has switched to track a pending acknowledgement for a new message counter value. See [Section 4.12.5.2.2, “Standalone acknowledgement processing”](#_bookmark332).

3.  A message that is not a [standalone acknowledgement](#mrp-standalone-acknowledgement) is sent which serves as an acknowledge­ ment for the entry. See [Section 4.12.5.1.1, “Piggyback acknowledgment processing”](#_bookmark328).

### MRP Messages

#### MRP Standalone Acknowledgement

> The *MRP Standalone Acknowledgement* message SHALL be formed as follows:

- The application payload SHALL be empty.

- The [A Flag](#_bookmark241) SHALL be set to 1.

&nbsp;

- The [Acknowledged Message Counter](#acknowledged-message-counter-32-bits) SHALL be included in the header.

- The [Protocol ID](#protocol-id-16-bits) SHALL be set to [PROTOCOL_ID_SECURE_CHANNEL](#_bookmark249).

- The [Protocol Opcode](#protocol-opcode-8-bits) SHALL be set to [*MRP Standalone Acknowledgement*](#_bookmark308).

> The rules for when to send this message are detailed in [Section 4.12.5.2.2, “Standalone acknowl­](#_bookmark332) [edgement processing”](#_bookmark332).

### Parameters and Constants

> This is a glossary of the MRP parameters used in this chapter with a brief description for each para­ meter. A Node SHALL use the provided default value for each parameter unless the message recipi­ ent Node advertises an alternate value for the parameter via Operational Discovery.
>
> *Table 22. Glossary of MRP parameters*

## Unicast Communication

> This section specifies the semantics of establishing a unicast session and the lifecycle of a unicast session.
>
> Unicast sessions exist in one of two phases:

1.  Session Establishment Phase: A series of well-defined unencrypted messages that aim to estab­ lish a shared key.

2.  Application Data Phase: A series of ad-hoc encrypted messages exchanging interaction model protocol actions, application data, etc.

### Session Parameters

> This is a glossary of the session parameters used during session establishment with a brief descrip­ tion for each parameter. A Node SHALL use the provided default value for each parameter unless the message recipient Node advertises an alternate value for the parameter via Operational Discov­ ery.
>
> *Table 23. Glossary of Session parameters*

| **Parameter Name** | **Description** | **Default Value** |
|----|----|----|
| *SESSION_IDLE_INTERVAL* | Minimum amount of time between sender retries when the destination node is Idle. This SHALL be greater than or equal to the maximum amount of time a node may be non-responsive to incoming messages when Idle. | 500 millisec­ onds |
| *SESSION_ACTIVE_INTERVAL* | Minimum amount of time between sender retries when the destination node is Active. This SHALL be greater than or equal to the maximum amount of time a node may be non-responsive to incoming messages when Active. | 300 millisec­ onds |
| *SESSION_ACTIVE_THRESHOLD* | Minimum amount of time the node SHOULD stay active after network activity. | 4000 millisec­ onds |
| *DATA_MODEL_REVISION* | Version of Data Model for the Session para­ meters side where it appears. | See [DataModel­](#datamodelrevision-attribute) [Revision](#datamodelrevision-attribute) attribute. |
| *INTERACTION_MODEL_REVISION* | Version of Interaction Model for the Ses­ sion parameters side where it appears. | See [Section](#revision-history-2) [8.1.1, “Revision](#revision-history-2) [History”](#revision-history-2). |
| *SPECIFICATION_VERSION* | Version of Specification for the Session parameters side where it appears. | See [Specifica­](#specificationversion-attribute) [tionVersion](#specificationversion-attribute) attribute. |
| *MAX_PATHS_PER_INVOKE* | The maximum number of elements in the InvokeRequests list that the Node is able to process | See [Max­](#maxpathsperinvoke-attribute) [PathsPerIn­](#maxpathsperinvoke-attribute) [voke](#maxpathsperinvoke-attribute) attribute. |
| *SUPPORTED_TRANSPORTS* | A bitmap of the supported transport proto­ cols in addition to [MRP](#message-reliability-protocol-mrp). | See [Table 7,](#_bookmark216) [“Supported](#_bookmark216) [Transport](#_bookmark216) [Mode Values”](#_bookmark216). |
| *MAX_TCP_MESSAGE_SIZE* | Maximum size of the message carried over TCP, excluding the framing [message length](#message-length-1632-bits) field, that the node is capable of receiving from its peer. | 64000 bytes. |

> These parameters are encoded in the following TLV format when included in CASE / PASE session establishment:

[TABLE]

> For backwards compatibility, if any tag after tag 2 (*SESSION_ACTIVE_INTERVAL*) is present, then the
>
> *SESSION_ACTIVE_INTERVAL* SHALL also be present.

#### NOTE

> That means that *SESSION_ACTIVE_INTERVAL* is always present if the sender of the CASE/PASE session establishment message supports *DATA_MODEL_REVISION*, *INTERACTION_MODEL_REVISION*, and *SPECIFICATION_VERSION*, but recipients
>
> SHALL NOT assume that it is present.
>
> For backwards compatibility, if the *DATA_MODEL_REVISION* field is missing, it implies a DataMod­ elRevision value of either 16 or 17.
>
> For backwards compatibility, if the *INTERACTION_MODEL_REVISION* field is missing, it implies a value of either 10 or 11.
>
> For backwards compatibility, if the *SPECIFICATION_VERSION* field is missing, it implies a Specifica­ tionVersion value strictly smaller than 0x01030000.
>
> For backwards compatibility, if the *MAX_PATHS_PER_INVOKE* field is missing, it implies a Max­ PathsPerInvoke set to 1.
>
> For backwards compatibility, if the *SUPPORTED_TRANSPORTS* field is missing, it implies that the node only supports [MRP](#message-reliability-protocol-mrp). When present with a value of 0, it indicates that the node only supports [MRP](#message-reliability-protocol-mrp).
>
> The *MAX_TCP_MESSAGE_SIZE* field SHALL only be present if the *SUPPORTED_TRANSPORTS* field indicates that TCP is supported.

### Session Establishment Phase

> Session establishment uses either the [CASE](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case) or [PASE](#passcode-authenticated-session-establishment-pase) protocol.
>
> [CASE](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case) SHALL be used as a session establishment mechanism for **all** sessions except:
>
> 1\. Communication for the purpose of commissioning when [NOC](#node-operational-certificate-noc) has not yet been installed
>
> [PASE](#passcode-authenticated-session-establishment-pase) SHALL only be used for session establishment mechanism during device commissioning. [PASE](#passcode-authenticated-session-establishment-pase) SHALL NOT be used as a session establishment mechanism for any other session. [BTP](#bluetooth-transport-protocol-btp) MAY be used as the transport for device commissioning. [BTP](#bluetooth-transport-protocol-btp) SHALL NOT be used as a transport for opera­ tional purposes.
>
> Unless otherwise specified, the [CASE](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case), [PASE](#passcode-authenticated-session-establishment-pase), [User-Directed Commissioning](#user-directed-commissioning) protocol, and [Secure](#secure-channel-status-report-messages) [Channel Status Report](#secure-channel-status-report-messages) messages SHALL be the only allowed **unencrypted** messages.
>
> This phase aims to:

1.  Authenticate peers (CASE-based sessions only).

2.  Derive shared secrets to encrypt subsequent session data.

3.  Choose session identifiers to identify the subsequent session.

#### Unsecured Session Context

> The following session context data SHALL be utilized to associate messages to a particular peer and recover context during unencrypted sessions:

1.  Session Role: Records whether the node is the session initiator or responder.

2.  Ephemeral Initiator Node ID: Randomly selected for each session by the initiator from the [Oper­](#operational-node-id) [ational Node ID](#operational-node-id) range and enclosed by initiator as [Source Node ID](#source-node-id-64-bits) and responder as [Destination](#destination-node-id) [Node ID](#destination-node-id).

    - Initiators SHALL select a new random ephemeral node ID for each unsecured session, and SHALL select an ID that does not conflict with any ephemeral node IDs for any other ongo­ ing unsecured sessions opened by the initiator.

3.  [Message Reception State](#message-reception-state): Provides tracking for the [Unencrypted Message Counter](#global-unencrypted-message-counter) of the remote peer.

> Matching and responder creation of Unsecured Session Contexts SHALL be as follows:

1.  Given an incoming unencrypted message

    1.  Locate any Unsecured Session Context with matching Ephemeral Initiator Node ID

        1.  If any is located, the incoming message SHALL be assumed to be associated with this

> Unsecured Session Context

2.  Else if the message carries a [Source Node ID](#source-node-id-64-bits)

    1.  Create a new Unsecured Session Context

    2.  Set Session Role to responder

    3.  Record the incoming message’s [Source Node ID](#source-node-id-64-bits) as Ephemeral Initiator Node ID

3.  Else discard the message

> Initiator creation of Unsecured Session Contexts SHALL be as follows:

1.  Given the first outgoing message of an unencrypted exchange

    1.  Create a new Unsecured Session Context

    2.  Set Session Role to initiator

    3.  Randomly select a node ID from the [Operational Node ID](#operational-node-id) range that does not collide with any ephemeral node IDs for any other ongoing unsecured sessions opened by the initiator and record this as Ephemeral Initiator Node ID

#### Session Establishment over IP

> When establishing a session over IP, the initiator MAY use TCP when both of the following are true:

1.  The initiator supports TCP Client as defined in the [Supported Transport Mode Values](#_bookmark216) table in the

> [T record](#_bookmark215).

2.  The responder supports TCP Server as defined in the [Supported Transport Mode Values](#_bookmark216) table in the [T record](#_bookmark215).

> Otherwise, the initiator SHALL use MRP to establish the session.
>
> The transport used during the session establishment phase SHALL also be used for the subsequent transport of messages over the established session.

#### Shared Secrets

> Both [CASE](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case) and [PASE](#passcode-authenticated-session-establishment-pase) produce two shared keys: I2RKey and R2IKey. These keys will be saved to the session’s context and used to encrypt and decrypt messages during the Session Data Phase.
>
> Nodes that support the [CASE session resumption](#session-resumption) SHALL also save to the session’s context the
>
> [SharedSecret](#_bookmark373) computed during the [CASE](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case) protocol execution.

#### Choosing Secure Unicast Session Identifiers

> Both [CASE](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case) and [PASE](#passcode-authenticated-session-establishment-pase) allow each participant the ability to choose a unicast session identifier for the subsequent encrypted session. The session identifier SHALL be used to look up the relevant encryp­ tion keys and any other metadata for a particular session.
>
> Messages using a unicast session identifier SHALL set the [Session Type](#_bookmark230) field to 0. Each peer SHALL specify a Session Identifier unique in reference to **their own** active sessions. There SHALL NOT be overlap between the Session ID values allocated for [PASE](#passcode-authenticated-session-establishment-pase) and [CASE](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case) sessions, as the Session Identi­ fier space is shared across both session establishment methods.
>
> For example, if the initiator has two active sessions with session identifiers 0x0001 and 0x0002, it could choose any non-zero session identifier besides 0x0001 and 0x0002.
>
> If there are no available session identifiers (i.e. the participant has 65,535 open sessions), the Node SHALL terminate an existing session to free a session identifier.

### Application Data Phase

> When the last [CASE](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case) or [PASE](#passcode-authenticated-session-establishment-pase) protocol message is sent or received and successfully processed, ses­
>
> sion establishment has completed.

#### Secure Session Context

> During the Application Data Phase, the following conceptual session context data SHALL be utilized to securely process subsequent messages:

1.  Session Type: Records whether the session was established using [CASE](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case) or [PASE](#passcode-authenticated-session-establishment-pase).

2.  Session Role: Records whether the node is the session initiator or responder.

3.  Local Session Identifier: Individually selected by each participant in secure unicast communi­ cation during session establishment and used as a unique identifier to recover encryption keys, authenticate incoming messages and associate them to existing sessions.

    - On a given Node, this is the identifier that SHALL be used to map from an incoming mes­ sage’s Session ID field to the session context data.

4.  Peer Session Identifier: Assigned by the peer during session establishment.

    - On a given Node, this is the identifier that SHALL be used in the [Session ID](#session-id-16-bits) field of every out­ going message associated with the session, so that it can be interpreted as the Local Session Identifier by the remote peer.

5.  I2RKey: Encrypts data in messages sent from the initiator of session establishment to the respon­ der.

6.  R2IKey: Encrypts data in messages sent from the session establishment responder to the initia­ tor.

7.  SharedSecret: Computed during the [CASE](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case) protocol execution and re-used when [CASE session](#session-resumption) [resumption](#session-resumption) is implemented.

8.  Local Message Counter: [Secure Session Message Counter](#secure-session-message-counters) for outbound messages.

    - At successful session establishment, the Local Message Counter SHALL be initialized per [Sec­](#message-counter-initialization) [tion 4.6.1.1, “Message Counter Initialization”](#message-counter-initialization).

9.  [Message Reception State](#message-reception-state): Provides tracking for the [Secure Session Message Counter](#secure-session-message-counters) of the remote peer.

10. Local Fabric Index: Records the local [Index](#fabric-index) for the session’s Fabric, which MAY be used to look up Fabric metadata related to the Fabric for which this session context applies.

    - This field SHALL contain the "no Fabric" value of 0 when the SessionType is PASE and success­ ful invocation of the [AddNOC](#addnoc-command) command has not yet occurred during commissioning.

11. Peer Node ID: Records the authenticated node ID of the remote peer, when available.

    - This field SHALL contain the "Unspecified Node ID" value of 0 when the SessionType is PASE.

12. Resumption ID: The ID used when resuming a session between the local and remote peer.

13. SessionTimestamp: A timestamp indicating the time at which the last message was sent or received. This timestamp SHALL be initialized with the time the session was created. See [Sec­](#session-establishment---out-of-resources) [tion 4.11.1.1, “Session Establishment - Out of Resources”](#session-establishment---out-of-resources) for more information.

14. ActiveTimestamp: A timestamp indicating the time at which the last message was received. This timestamp SHALL be initialized with the time the session was created.

2.  *SESSION_ACTIVE_INTERVAL*

3.  *SESSION_ACTIVE_THRESHOLD*

4.  PeerActiveMode: A boolean that tracks whether the peer node is in Active or Idle mode. Peer­ ActiveMode is set as follows:

[TABLE]

> Note that the Local Fabric Index and Peer Fabric Index reported in the [NOC Response](#nocresponse-command) MAY differ in value, while still referring to the same Fabric, since for a given complete [Fabric Reference](#fabric-references-and-fabric-identifier), the short [Fabric Index](#fabric-index) allocated during commissioning of the respective Nodes on the same Fabric MAY be different. This possible difference is due to the order in which the Fabric in question was joined in the lifecycle of the respective Nodes. See the section on [AddNOC command behavior](#_bookmark1603) for details on Fabric Index allocation behavior over time.
>
> There SHALL also be reservation of storage to support [CASE Authenticated Tag (CAT)](#_bookmark647) fields. The CAT fields are 32-bit values that MAY have been present in RDN [case-authenticated-tag](#_bookmark2007) of the remote peer’s operational certificate, during [CASE](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case).
>
> The CAT fields are used to cache Operational Certificate data so that it can be used by the [ACL pro­](#conceptual-access-control-privilege-granting-algorithm) [cessing logic](#conceptual-access-control-privilege-granting-algorithm) to support [CASE Authenticated Tags](#_bookmark647).
>
> Since these fields MAY be omitted from NOCs, they MAY be marked as absent in the context, such that they are not taken into account when missing. When present, they SHALL be stored. Maximum up to 3 CAT fields SHALL be supported.
>
> Their value is unused in [PASE](#passcode-authenticated-session-establishment-pase) session contexts.

## Session Establishment

### Passcode-Authenticated Session Establishment (PASE)

> This section describes session establishment using a shared [passcode](#passcode) together with an [augmented](#password-authenticated-key-exchange-pake) [Password-Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE)](#password-authenticated-key-exchange-pake), in which only one party knows the passcode before­ hand, to generate shared keys. This protocol is only used when commissioning a Node (i.e. the Com­ missionee).

#### Protocol Overview

> The Passcode-Authenticated Session Establishment (PASE) protocol aims to establish the first ses­ sion between a Commissioner and a Commissionee using a known passcode provided out-of-band. The pairing is performed using [Section 3.10, “Password-Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE)”](#password-authenticated-key-exchange-pake) and relies on a [Password-Based Key Derivation Function (PBKDF)](#password-based-key-derivation-function-pbkdf) where the passcode is used as pass­ word.
>
> This session establishment protocol provides a means to:

1.  Communicate PBKDF parameters.

2.  Derive PAKE bidirectional secrets.

![](media/image16.png)

> *Figure 14. Overview of the PASE Protocol*
>
> The Commissioner is the Initiator and the Commissionee is the Responder.
>
> It is assumed that the initiator has somehow obtained the passcode and that the responder has the relevant [Crypto_PAKEValues_Responder](#_bookmark176) corresponding to the passcode before starting a PASE session establishment protocol.

#### Protocol Details

> **Message format**
>
> All PASE messages SHALL be structured as specified in [Section 4.4, “Message Frame Format”](#message-frame-format). All PASE messages are sent using an [Unsecured Session](#unsecured-session-context):

- The [Session ID](#session-id-16-bits) field SHALL be set to 0.

- The [Session Type](#_bookmark230) bits of the [Security Flags](#security-flags-8-bits) SHALL be set to 0.

- In the PASE messages from the initiator, [S Flag](#_bookmark223) SHALL be set to 1 and [DSIZ](#_bookmark224) SHALL be set to 0.

- In the PASE messages from the responder, [S Flag](#_bookmark223) SHALL be set to 0 and [DSIZ](#_bookmark224) SHALL be set to 1.

> For each PASE message, the [application payload](#application-payload-variable-length) is the TLV encoding of the message structure as defined below:
>
> *Table 24. PASE Messages*

> The [PBKDFParamRequest](#_bookmark351), [PBKDFParamResponse](#_bookmark354), [Pake1](#_bookmark356), [Pake2](#_bookmark358), [Pake3](#_bookmark360), and [PakeFinished](#_bookmark362) of a distinct session establishment are part of the same [message exchange](#message-exchanges-1). The initiator and responder SHALL NOT send encrypted application data in the newly established session until [PakeFinished](#_bookmark362) is received by the initiator within the unencrypted session used for establishment.
>
> Each message SHALL use [PROTOCOL_ID_SECURE_CHANNEL](#_bookmark249) as [Protocol ID](#protocol-id-16-bits) and the corresponding [Protocol](#protocol-opcode-8-bits) [Opcode](#protocol-opcode-8-bits) as defined in [Table 18, “Secure Channel Protocol Opcodes”](#_bookmark308).
>
> The flags of the [Exchange Flags](#exchange-flags-8-bits) of the [Protocol Header](#protocol-header-field-descriptions) are defined as follows per PASE message:

| **Message**        | **I Flag** |
|--------------------|------------|
| PBKDFParamRequest  | 1          |
| PBKDFParamResponse | 0          |
| Pake1              | 1          |
| Pake2              | 0          |
| Pake3              | 1          |

> All PASE messages SHALL be sent reliably. This may be implicit (e.g. TCP) or explicit (e.g. [MRP](#message-reliability-protocol-mrp) reli­ able messaging) in the underlying transport.
>
> The other fields of the [Protocol Header](#protocol-header-field-descriptions) are not specific to the PASE messages.

[TABLE]

[TABLE]

1.  The initiator SHALL [generate a random number](#deterministic-random-bit-generator-drbg) InitiatorRandom = Crypto_DRBG(len = 32 \* 8).

2.  The initiator SHALL generate a [session identifier](#session-id-16-bits) (InitiatorSessionId) for subsequent identifica­ tion of this session. The InitiatorSessionId field SHALL NOT overlap with any other existing PASE or CASE [session identifier](#session-id-16-bits) in use by the initiator. See [Section 4.13.2.4, “Choosing Secure](#choosing-secure-unicast-session-identifiers) [Unicast Session Identifiers”](#choosing-secure-unicast-session-identifiers) for more details. The initiator SHALL set the Local Session Identi­ fier in the [Session Context](#secure-session-context) to the value InitiatorSessionId.

3.  The initiator SHALL choose a passcode identifier (PasscodeId) corresponding to a particular [PAKE](#password-authenticated-key-exchange-pake) passcode verifier installed on the responder. A value of 0 for the passcodeID SHALL corre­ spond to the [PAKE](#password-authenticated-key-exchange-pake) passcode verifier for the currently-open commissioning window, if any. Non- zero values are reserved for future use. For example, for initial commissioning, the verifier would be the built-in verifier matching the [Onboarding Payload](#onboarding-payload-contents)'s passcode or, equivalently, the [multi-fabric Basic Commissioning Method](#basic-commissioning-method-bcm) passcode if that method is supported. For the [multi-](#enhanced-commissioning-method-ecm) [fabric Enhanced Commissioning Method](#enhanced-commissioning-method-ecm), the verifier would match the verifier provided through the [OpenCommissioningWindow](#opencommissioningwindow-command) command.

4.  The initiator SHALL indicate whether the PBKDF parameters (salt and iterations) are known for the particular passcodeId (for example from the QR code) by setting HasPBKDFParameters. If HasP­ BKDFParameters is set to True, the responder SHALL NOT return the PBKDF parameters. If HasP­ BKDFParameters is set to False, the responder SHALL return the PBKDF parameters.

### Certificate Authenticated Session Establishment (CASE)

> This section describes a certificate-authenticated session establishment (CASE) protocol using [Node](#node-operational-credentials-specification) [Operational credentials](#node-operational-credentials-specification). This session establishment mechanism provides an authenticated key exchange between exactly two peers while maintaining privacy of each peer. A resumption mecha­ nism allows bootstrapping a new session from a previous one, dramatically reducing the computa­ tion required as well as reducing the number of messages exchanged.

#### Protocol Overview

> This session establishment protocol provides a means to:

1.  Mutually authenticate both peer Nodes

2.  Generate cryptographic keys to secure subsequent communication within a session

3.  Exchange operational parameters for the session, such as [Session Identifier](#session-id-16-bits) and [MRP](#message-reliability-protocol-mrp) parame­ ters

> The cryptographic protocol mirrors the \[[SIGMA](#_bookmark78)\] protocol and uses the [Identity Protection Key (IPK)](#_bookmark384) to provide better identity protection. Briefly, the protocol will:

1.  Exchange ephemeral elliptic curve public keys (Sigma1.initiatorEphPubKey and Sigma2.respon­ derEphPubKey) to generate a shared secret

2.  Exchange certificates to prove identities (Sigma2.encrypted2.responderNOC and Sigma3.encrypt­ ed3.initiatorNOC)

3.  Prove possession of the NOC private key by signing the ephemeral keys and NOC (sigma-2-tbs­

> data and sigma-3-tbsdata)
>
> The basic protocol can be achieved within 2 round trips as shown below:

![](media/image17.png)

> *Figure 15. Basic Session Establishment*

#### Session Resumption

> The protocol also provides a means to quickly resume a session using a previously established ses­ sion. Resumption does **not** require expensive signature creation and verification which signifi­ cantly reduces the computation time. Because of this, resumption is favoured for low-powered devices when applicable. Session resumption SHOULD be used by initiators when the necessary [state](#_bookmark366) is known to the initiator.
>
> The nomenclature Sigma1 with Resumption in the following subsections implies a [Sigma1](#_bookmark367) message with both the optional resumptionID and initiatorResumeMIC fields populated in sigma-1-struct.

![](media/image18.png)

> *Figure 16. Session Resumption*
>
> In the case where a Responder is not able to resume a session as requested by a [Sigma1 with Resump­](#_bookmark367) [tion](#_bookmark367), the information included in the [Sigma1 with Resumption](#_bookmark367) message SHALL be processed as a Sig­ ma1 message without any resumption fields to construct a [Sigma2](#_bookmark371) message and continue the stan­ dard session establishment protocol without resumption.
>
> To make the resumption succeed, both the Initiator and the Responder SHALL have remembered the [SharedSecret](#_bookmark373) they have computed during the previous execution of the CASE session establish­ ment. It SHALL be that [SharedSecret](#_bookmark373) that is used to compute the resumption ID.
>
> **Session Resumption State**
>
> To perform session resumption, the following state from the [previous session context](#secure-session-context) must be known to the initiator and responder:

1.  [SharedSecret](#secure-session-context)

2.  [Local Fabric Index](#secure-session-context)

3.  [Peer Node ID](#secure-session-context)

4.  [Peer CASE Authenticated Tags](#secure-session-context)

5.  [ResumptionID](#secure-session-context)

#### Protocol Details

> **Message format**
>
> All CASE messages SHALL be structured as specified in [Section 4.4, “Message Frame Format”](#message-frame-format). All CASE messages are sent using an [Unsecured Session](#unsecured-session-context):

- The [Session Type](#_bookmark230) bits of the [Security Flags](#security-flags-8-bits) SHALL be set to 0.

- In the CASE messages from the initiator, [S Flag](#_bookmark223) SHALL be set to 1 and [DSIZ](#_bookmark224) SHALL be set to 0.

- In the CASE messages from the responder, [S Flag](#_bookmark223) SHALL be set to 0 and [DSIZ](#_bookmark224) SHALL be set to 1.

If Msg1 contains both the resumptionID **and** initiatorResumeMIC fields, the responder SHALL search for an existing session that has a [Resumption ID](#secure-session-context) equal to the incoming resumptionID. If a single such session exists, the responder SHALL follow the steps in [Section 4.14.2.3.10, “Validate](#_bookmark377) [Sigma1 with Resumption”](#_bookmark377) rather than continue the steps outlined in [Section 4.14.2.3.5, “Validate](#_bookmark370) [Sigma1 Destination ID”](#_bookmark370).

4.  If Msg1 does not contain a resumptionID and initiatorResumeMIC field, the responder SHALL con­ tinue the steps in [Section 4.14.2.3.5, “Validate Sigma1 Destination ID”](#_bookmark370).

> **Validate Sigma1 Destination ID**

1.  The responder SHALL validate the incoming destinationId:

    1.  The responder SHALL traverse all its installed [Node Operational Certificates (NOC)](#node-operational-certificate-noc), gather­ ing the associated trusted roots' public keys from the associated chains and SHALL generate a candidateDestinationId based on the procedure in [Section 4.14.2.4.1, “Destination Identi­](#_bookmark381) [fier”](#_bookmark381) for that tuple of \<Root Public Key, Fabric ID, Node ID\>.

    2.  The responder SHALL verify that the incoming destinationId matches one of the candidat­ eDestinationId generated above. Upon such a match, the associated trusted root, Fabric ID, Node ID and IPK SHALL be recorded for subsequent use.

    3.  Note that at the initiator, only the current [Epoch Key](#epoch-keys) for the IPK will have been used. At the receiver, several IPK Epoch Keys may be installed, requiring several candidateDestinationId to be computed, one per available IPK Operational Key, per NOC.

2.  If there is no candidateDestinationId matching the incoming destinationId, the responder SHALL send a [status report](#secure-channel-status-report-messages): StatusReport(GeneralCode: FAILURE, ProtocolId: [SECURE_CHANNEL](#_bookmark249), ProtocolCode: [NO_SHARED_TRUST_ROOTS](#_bookmark312)) and perform no further processing.

3.  Otherwise, if a match was found for the destinationId, the matched [NOC](#node-operational-certificate-noc), [ICAC](#intermediate-ca-ica-certificate) (if present), and associated trusted root SHALL be used for selection of the responderNOC and responderICAC in the steps for [Sigma2](#_bookmark371).

#### Field Descriptions

> **Destination Identifier**

[TABLE]

> The Destination Identifier field enables the initiator of the [Sigma1](#_bookmark367) message to unambiguously express the following, in a privacy-preserving manner:

- Which shared Trusted Root to select

- Which Fabric ID to use for validation of initiator and responder operational certificates

- Which Node ID is targeted in the given Fabric This serves several purposes:

  1.  It requires an initiator to have knowledge of both the [IPK](#_bookmark384) and one of the full identities of the responder Node before it forces the responder node to generate a costly [Sigma2](#_bookmark371) message

> a\. Note that the replay of previously recorded initiator messages is possible, and therefore a Node MAY choose to keep memory of some prior destination identifiers that were success­ fully processed which it would later reject if seen again, for additional replay protection

2.  It ensures that there is no ambiguity on the responder as to which Fabric was selected for com­ munication

3.  It hides which Fabric was chosen by the initiator A destination identifier is generated by:

&nbsp;

1.  Concatenating the following octet strings for subsequent usage as a destinationMessage:

    - initiatorRandom: The value of initiatorRandom that will be used in the same message as the Destination Identifier

    - rootPublicKey: The public key of the root of trust of the desired fabric, from the ec-pub-key field of the [Matter Certificate](#matter-certificate) of that root, as an uncompressed elliptic curve point as defined in section 2.3.3 of [SEC 1](#_bookmark76)

    - fabricId: The Fabric ID of the destination, matching the matter-fabric-id field of the [Matter](#matter-certificate) [Certificate](#matter-certificate) of the desired destination’s [NOC](#node-operational-certificate-noc), and encoding the 64-bit scalar as a little-endian byte order octet string

    - nodeId: The Node ID of the destination, matching the matter-node-id field of the [Matter Cer­](#matter-certificate) [tificate](#matter-certificate) of the desired destination’s [NOC](#node-operational-certificate-noc), and encoding the 64-bit scalar as a little-endian byte order octet string

2.  Obtaining the appropriate [Identity Protection Key (IPK)](#_bookmark384) [Operational Group Key](#operational-group-key-derivation) for the associ­ ated [Fabric](#fabric-scoped-data) under [Group Key Set index](#_bookmark406) 0 within the [Group Key Management Cluster](#group-key-management-cluster).

3.  Computing an identifier destinationIdentifier of length CRYPTO_HASH_LEN_BYTES using Crypto_H­ MAC() with the IPK as the key and destinationMessage as the message

> The above steps can be summarized as:

[TABLE]

> For example, given the following:

- Root public key for the common Fabric, in uncompressed elliptical curve point form:

[TABLE]

- Common Fabric ID of 0x2906_C908_D115_D362 scalar (octets "62:d3:15:d1:08:c9:06:29" in little- endian)

- Desired Destination Node ID of 0xCD55_44AA_7B13_EF14 (octets "14:ef:13:7b:aa:44:55:cd" in lit­ tle-endian)

  - [Identity Protection Key](#_bookmark384) Epoch Key value of:

    - Note that this is the octet string of a group Epoch Key as would be provided in the [IPKValue](#_bookmark1600) field of the [AddNOC](#addnoc-command) command in the [Node Operational Credentials Cluster](#node-operational-credentials-cluster), or in one of the EpochKey fields of the [KeySetWrite](#keysetwrite-command) command in the [Group Key Management Cluster](#group-key-management-cluster).

    - The [derived Operational Group Key](#operational-group-key-derivation) to be used for computation of a destination identifier, given the above values of root public key, Fabric ID and Identity Protection Key Epoch Key, would be:

  - Initiator Random value of:

[TABLE]

> Then, using the above procedure would yield the following:

- DestinationMessage octets:

[TABLE]

- DestinationIdentifier octets:

> **Public Key**

> A public key ec-pub-key is the byte string representation of an uncompressed elliptic curve point as defined in section 2.3.3 of [SEC 1](#_bookmark76).

> where \|\| indicates message concatenation and ResumptionID is the new identifier for the this ses­ sion.

#### Session Context Storage

> After the session is established successfully at both peers, some fields SHALL be recorded in the secure session context for later use (see [Section 4.13.3, “Application Data Phase”](#application-data-phase)), in addition to the [Session Encryption Keys](#_bookmark389):

- The peer [NOC](#node-operational-certificate-noc)'s matter-node-id ([1.3.6.1.4.1.37244.1.1](#_bookmark2002)) from the subject field

- The [Section 2.5.1, “Fabric References and Fabric Identifier”](#fabric-references-and-fabric-identifier) for the Fabric within which this secure session is being established

- All peer [NOC](#node-operational-certificate-noc)'s case-authenticated-tag ([1.3.6.1.4.1.37244.1.6](#_bookmark2007)) from the subject field, if present These fields MAY be recorded at any opportune point during the protocol, but SHALL only be com­

> mitted to the secure session context once the session is established successfully at both peers.

#### Minimal Number of CASE Sessions

> A node SHALL support at least 3 CASE session contexts per fabric. Device type specifications MAY require a larger minimum. Unless the device type specification says otherwise, a minimum number it defines is a per-fabric minimum.
>
> The minimal supported capabilities, subject to the minimal constraints above, are reported in the [CapabilityMinima](#capabilityminima-attribute) of the [Basic Information cluster](#basic-information-cluster).

- Example: If a device type requires at least 4 CASE session contexts, and a node supports 7 fab­ rics, the node would support at least 28 CASE session contexts, and ensure that each fabric could use at least 4 of them.

## Secure Communications over TCP

> Matter messages over [MRP](#message-reliability-protocol-mrp) need to be sized so that each UDP datagram fits within an IPv6 MTU limit of 1280 bytes, to avoid IPv6 fragmentation and reassembly. Thus, larger messages cannot be transferred over MRP unless the application explicitly performs fragmentation and reassembly. Therefore, nodes that need to send [large command messages](#large-message-quality) must use an alternative transport pro­ tocol, such as TCP. TCP support is communicated by nodes through the [TXT record key](#_bookmark215) [T](#_bookmark215) in their DNS-SD operational service records.
>
> Since TCP already provides message transmission reliability, a node that is using TCP as the under­ lying transport protocol SHALL NOT use MRP reliability semantics on its message exchanges.

### Secure Session Establishment

> When a pair of nodes that both support TCP intend to establish a secure session between them­ selves, they MAY choose TCP as the underlying transport protocol. With a given peer, a node SHOULD, typically, either have a secure session over MRP or one over TCP, but MAY also have both. For example, a node might be using MRP for all its interactions with a controller, but might set up a session over TCP with the same for specific data-heavy operations such as OTA.
>
> The underlying TCP connection MAY be long-lived or short-lived depending on the use case. Unlike MRP, which does not rely on an underlying connection, a secure session over TCP is unusable when its connection is broken or is closed. Nodes MAY choose to remove the secure session when the con­ nection goes down. If the session is retained after the connection goes away, then the session SHALL be marked appropriately so that the underlying connection is re-established before the ses­ sion can be used again. Moreover, the [session resumption](#session-resumption) state MAY be retained to expedite session establishment when the connection is re-established with the corresponding peer.

### TCP Connection Management

> A TCP connection between a pair of nodes requires appropriate configurations and active manage­ ment in order to meet the responsiveness demands of the application.

#### TCP Connection Configuration

> The TCP connection configuration parameters MAY include the following:

1.  Connection Establishment Timeout: A node MAY use this option to configure the amount of time that it waits for an initiated connection establishment attempt to succeed, before giving up and notifying the application.

2.  TCP Keep Alive Messages For Connection Liveness: TCP Keep Alive messages MAY be used to maintain liveness for long-lived connections. They MAY be used at both the client and server to configure the liveness for each half of the connection. The configurable parameters SHALL be:

    1.  *TCP_KEEP_ALIVE_TIME* : The interval between the last data packet sent and the first keep- alive probe.

    2.  *TCP_KEEP_ALIVE_INTERVAL* : The interval between subsequent keep-alive probes.

    3.  *TCP_KEEP_ALIVE_PROBES* : The number of unacknowledged probes to send before consid­ ering the connection dead and notifying the application.

3.  TCP User Timeout: The TCP User Timeout option specifies the amount of time that transmitted data may remain unacknowledged before the TCP connection is forcibly closed. This option MAY be used by a node to limit the time the connection stays open when the data flow is not progressing.

> The total TCP Keep Alive Timeout is given by:

[TABLE]

#### TCP Connection Closures And Re-establishment

> The TCP connection MAY be closed by either side of the connection. A node MAY proactively close its connection when instructed by the upper layer. It MAY also close the connection based on its current state.
>
> For example, it MAY close its connection under the following circumstances:

4.  The TCP Keep Alive Timeout expires on an idle connection.

5.  Sent data on the connection is not acknowledged at the TCP layer, and the configured TCP User Timeout expires.

> When the TCP layer of a node gets notified that the peer has closed the connection, it SHALL close its end of the connection as well, and notify the application. Subsequently, all active [Exchanges](#message-exchanges-1) over that connection SHOULD also be closed as they would be unusable over a closed connection.
>
> Either side MAY choose to re-establish the connection when it is closed or determined to be broken. A node SHOULD back-off (typically, based on a Fibonacci back-off sequence) a random amount of time after the connection closure, before attempting to establish the connection again.
>
> A node, upon receipt of a connection request from a peer, SHOULD discard its own backed-off con­ nection retry timer to the same peer, if one is active.
>
> This random back-off mechanism SHOULD prevent connection races between peers for most, if not all scenarios. In addition, nodes SHOULD try to reap old unused connections as much as possible to conserve resources.

#### Memory Requirements for Large messages

> Since the TCP transport is designed for large messages, the system platform is expected to have memory available for storing the received messages. The system platform MAY configure a Maximum Message Size for the payload that it is capable of receiving over the TCP connection. If a node receives a message header that indicates that the message is larger than the Maximum Message Size that it supports, then it SHALL close the connection, and SHOULD send a [Status Report](#appendix-d-status-report-messages) error mes­ sage with a status code set to MESSAGE_TOO_LARGE back to the sender, before closing the connection.
>
> Given that a node MAY be using both MRP and TCP for sending/receiving messages with different peers, and these transports have different Maximum Message Size configurations, the system SHOULD be able to dynamically change this configuration based on what transport the current Exchange is using.

## Group Communication

> This section specifies the semantics of sending and receiving multicast group messages and the life­ cycle of such groupcast sessions. Multicast addressing is accomplished using the 16-bit [Group ID](#group-identifier-gid) field as the destination address. A multicast group is a collection of Nodes, all registered under the same multicast Group ID. A multicast message is sent to a particular destination group and is received by all members of that group.

### Groupcast Session Context

> Groupcast sessions are conceptually long-running, lasting the duration of a node’s membership in a group. Group membership is tracked in the [Group Key Management Cluster](#group-key-management-cluster). However, on ingress of each groupcast message, the following ephemeral context SHALL be constructed to inform upper layers of groupcast message provenance:

1.  Fabric Index: Records the local [Fabric Index](#fabric-index) for the Fabric to which an incoming message’s group is scoped.

2.  Group ID: Captures the [Group ID](#group-identifier-gid) to which a groupcast message was sent.

3.  Source Node ID: The [Source Node ID](#source-node-id-64-bits) enclosed by the sender of a groupcast message.

    - Together, [Fabric Index](#fabric-index), [Group ID](#group-identifier-gid) and [Source Node ID](#source-node-id-64-bits) comprise a unique identifier that upper layers may use to understand the source and destination of groupcast messages.

4.  Source IP Address: The unicast source IP address for the originator of the message.

5.  Source Port: The source port for the originator of the message.

    - The source IP address and port MAY be used for unicast responses to group communication peers, as are required for the [Message Counter Synchronization Protocol](#message-counter-synchronization-protocol-mcsp).

6.  Operational Group Key: The [Operational Group Key](#group-key-management) that was used to encrypt the incoming group message.

7.  Group Session ID: Records the [Group Session ID](#group-session-id) derived from the [Operational Group Key](#group-key-management) used to encrypt the message.

> Once a Groupcast Session Context with [trust-first](#trust-first-policy) policy is created to track authenticated messages from a given Source Node ID, that record SHALL NOT be deleted or recycled until the node reboots. This is to prevent replay attacks that first exhaust the memory allocated to group session counter tracking and then inject older messages as valid, and enforces that trust-first authentication works as intended within the full duration of a boot cycle. Any message from a source that cannot be tracked SHALL be dropped.

### Sending a group message

> To prepare a multicast message to a Group ID with a given [GroupKeySetID](#_bookmark406) and IPv6 hop count parameter, the Node SHALL:

1.  Obtain, for the given GroupKeySetID, the current Operational Group Key as the Encryption Key, and the associated Group Session ID.

    1.  If no key is found for the given GroupKeySetID, security processing SHALL fail and no fur­ ther security processing SHALL be done on this message.

2.  Perform [Section 4.7.1, “Message Transmission”](#message-transmission) processing steps on the message with the follow­ ing arguments:

    1.  The Destination Node Id argument SHALL be the [Group Node Id](#group-node-id) corresponding to the given Group ID.

    2.  The Session Id argument SHALL be the Group Session ID from step 1.

    3.  The Security Flags SHALL have only the [P Flag](#_bookmark227) set.

    4.  The transport SHALL be a site-local routable IPv6 interface.

> Next, prepare the message as an IPv6 packet:

1.  Set the private, secured message from step 2 above as the IPv6 payload.

2.  Set the IPv6 hop count to the value given.

3.  Set the IPv6 destination to the [Section 2.5.6.2, “IPv6 Multicast Address”](#ipv6-multicast-address) based on the provided destination Group ID, Fabric ID, and [GroupKeyMulticastPolicy](#_bookmark1257) of the group key.

4.  Set the IPv6 source to an operational [IPv6 Unicast Address](#ipv6-unicast-address) of the sending Node.

5.  Set the IPv6 UDP port number to the [Matter IPv6 multicast port](#ipv6-multicast-port-number).

### Receiving a group message

> All Nodes supporting groups SHALL register to receive on the associated [IPv6 multicast address](#ipv6-multicast-address), at the [Matter IPv6 multicast port](#ipv6-multicast-port-number), for each group of which they are a member.
>
> Upon receiving an IPv6 message addressed to one of these Multicast Addresses the Node is regis­ tered for, the Node SHALL:

1.  Extract the message from the IPv6 payload.

2.  Perform [Section 4.7.2, “Message Reception”](#message-reception) processing steps on the message.

## Group Key Management

> This section describes operational group keys, a mechanism for generating, disseminating and managing shared symmetric keys across a group of Nodes in a Fabric. Operational group keys are made available to applications for the purpose of authenticating peers, securing group communica­ tions, and encrypting data. These keys allow Nodes to:

- Prove to each other that they are members of the associated group

- Exchange messages confidentially, and without fear of manipulation by non-members of the group

- Encrypt data in such a way that it can only be decrypted by other members of the group

> A central feature of operational group keys is the ability to limit access to keys to a trusted set of Nodes. In particular, credentials required to generate operational group keys SHALL only be acces­ sible to Nodes with a certain level of privilege — those deemed a member of the group. Barring soft­ ware error or compromise of a privileged Node, access to shared keys SHALL be computationally infeasible for non-trusted parties.
>
> Operational group keys are shareable across all types and combinations of Nodes as determined by the Administrator managing the group. Given all Nodes in possession of the current epoch keys for the group can communicate with other Nodes in the group, it is the responsibility of the Adminis­ trator managing the group to only compose groups of Nodes where communication is appropriate for the given application and security requirements.

### Operational Groups

> An operational group is a logical collection of Nodes that are running one or more common applica­ tion clusters and share a common security domain in the form of a shared, symmetric group key. For example, a set of Nodes running a lighting application can form an operational group by shar­ ing a common operational group key derived from the mechanisms described here. Subgroups can be formed within the operational group by defining distinct Group Identifiers for each set of Nodes, while sharing a common operational group key.
>
> Membership in the security domain of an operational group is determined by a Node’s possession of all the epoch keys required to generate the current, valid *operational group key* for the group. Individual Nodes can be members of multiple operational groups simultaneously. The set of groups to which a Node belongs can change over time as dictated by application requirements and policies. Groups MAY be introduced or withdrawn over time as need arises.

#### 4.17.1.1. Operational Group Ids

> Operational groups are identified uniquely within a Fabric by a [Group Identifier](#group-identifier-gid). Administrators SHALL assign Group Ids such that no two operational groups within a Fabric have the same Group ID. It is assumed a given Administrator has sufficient access to centralized knowledge, so as to allo­ cate unique Group Ids under a given Fabric such that there are no collisions.
>
> Multiple operational groups MAY share the same operational group key, and thus be used to create logical subgroups over a shared security domain. Operational groups which do not share related functionality, such as a lighting group and a sprinkler group, SHOULD NOT share the same opera­ tional key. As an example policy, a lighting application could have all lighting Nodes share a single group key, while organizing lighting subgroups for various rooms or spaces within the structure by assigning a different Group ID to each such subgroup.

### Operational Group Key Derivation

> An *operational group key* is a symmetric key used as the Encryption Key during [Message Processing](#message-processing) for group communication. An *operational group key* is produced by applying a key derivation func­ tion with an *epoch key* and salt value as inputs as follows:

[TABLE]

> where \[\] denotes a zero-length array.
>
> The Info portion of the key derivation is specified in [Section 4.17.2.1, “Group Security Info”](#group-security-info). The
>
> Salt portion of the key derivation is specified in [Section 4.3.2.2, “Compressed Fabric Identifier”](#compressed-fabric-identifier).
>
> For example, given:

- An Epoch Key value of: 23:5b:f7:e6:28:23:d3:58:dc:a4:ba:50:b1:53:5f:4b

- A CompressedFabricIdentifier value of: 87:e1:b0:04:e2:35:a1:30

> After the above derivation following the definition of Crypto_KDF in [Section 3.8, “Key Derivation](#key-derivation-function-kdf) [Function (KDF)”](#key-derivation-function-kdf), the resulting operational group key would be: a6:f5:30:6b:af:6d:05:0a:f2:3b:a4:bd:6b:9d:d9:60.
>
> Group membership is enforced by limiting access to the epoch keys. Only Nodes that possess the input epoch key can derive a given operational key. Lack of possession of a particular epoch key restricts access, based on the distribution policy of the epoch keys.
>
> The following diagram shows the process by which operational keys are derived from the epoch key material:
>
> ![](media/image19.png)
>
> *Figure 17. Group Key Derivation*

#### Group Security Info

> A hard-coded *group security info* is used to diversify the set of operational group keys. This value is hard-coded into the standard’s implementation, and thus is distributed with the associated code. Should the standard’s security mechanisms need to evolve (e.g. to upgrade encryption from AES- 128 to AES-256), the *group security info* can be changed to ensure that new keys will be derived for use in the new algorithm. The *group security info* SHALL be the byte stream "GroupKey v1.0", i.e. 0x47 0x72 0x6f 0x75 0x70 0x4b 0x65 0x79 0x20 0x76 0x31 0x2e 0x30.
>
> With the exception of the *group security info*, all input key material SHALL be maintained on a per- Fabric basis.

#### Group Key Set

> A *group key set* limits the key derivation process to Nodes within the respective operational groups. Access to a *group key set* is limited based on the functionality provided by a Node and/or the privi­ lege afforded to it. For example, certain home security devices, such as a security system or door lock, may have access to a "Physical Access" *group key set*, while devices such as light bulbs or win­ dow coverings would not.
>
> Operational group key lifetime is limited by assigning an expiration time to each *epoch key* in a given *group key set*. By constraining the validity of a given epoch key to an epoch, the ability for members to derive and operate with an operational group key can be constrained to particular periods of time. Epoch keys may be rotated on a periodic basis, and denying access to updated ver­ sions of these keys serves as a means to eject group members.

### Epoch Keys

> Epoch keys provide a means for limiting the lifetime of derived operational group keys. They also provide a way for an Administrator to revoke access to Nodes that have been explicitly excluded from an operational group (albeit after a period of time).
>
> Epoch keys are generated, managed, and stored by an Administrator on a per-Fabric basis. Each key SHALL be a [random](#deterministic-random-bit-generator-drbg) value of length [CRYPTO_SYMMETRIC_KEY_LENGTH_BITS](#data-confidentiality-and-integrity) bits.

[TABLE]

> Each epoch key has associated with it a start time that denotes the time at which the key becomes active for use by transmitting Nodes. Epoch key start times are absolute UTC time in microseconds encoded using the [epoch-us](#epoch-time-in-microseconds-type) representation.

#### Using Epoch Keys

> Nodes sending group messages SHALL use operational group keys that are derived from the *current epoch key* (specifically, the epoch key with the *latest* start time that is not in the future). Nodes that cannot reliably keep track of time calculate the *current epoch key* as described in [Section 4.17.3.4,](#epoch-key-rotation-without-time-synchronization) [“Epoch Key Rotation without Time Synchronization”](#epoch-key-rotation-without-time-synchronization).
>
> Nodes receiving group messages SHALL accept the use of any key derived from one of the currently installed epoch keys. This requirement holds regardless of whether the start time for the key is in the future or the past. This means Nodes continue to accept communication secured under an epoch key until that key is withdrawn by explicitly deleting the key from a Node’s group state by the key distribution Administrator.
>
> Note that there is no end time associated with an epoch key. An epoch key marked with the maxi­ mum start time SHALL be disabled and render the corresponding epoch key slot unused.

#### Managing Epoch Keys

> The epoch keys are managed using the [Group Key Management Cluster](#group-key-management-cluster). For every group key set published by the key distribution Administrator, there SHALL be at least 1 and at most 3 epoch keys in rotation. Key additions or updates are done using the [KeySetWrite](#keysetwrite-command) command.
>
> Key updates are idempotent operations to ensure the Administrator is always the source of truth. An epoch key update SHALL order the keys from oldest to newest.
>
> Any epoch key update MAY deliver a partial key set but SHALL include EpochKey0 and MAY include EpochKey1 and EpochKey2. Any update of the key set, including a partial update, SHALL remove all previous keys in the set, however many were defined.
>
> An Administrator MAY completely remove a group key set from a Node using the [KeySetRemove](#keysetremove-command) command.

#### Epoch Key Rotation

> The key distribution Administrator generates new epoch keys on a regular basis, giving each a unique id and adding them to the list of existing epoch keys within a group. The start time for each new epoch key is scheduled to occur after a configurable *key propagation interval*. The propagation interval is set sufficiently large such that the Administrator can synchronize all Nodes in the opera­ tional group with the new epoch key list within that time.
>
> The rotation rate for epoch keys is expected to be on the order of days to weeks for typical applica­ tions, but the rate is configurable as required by the key distribution Administrator. Because of the relatively long rotation interval, and the overlap of active epoch keys, local clock drift within Nodes is generally not a concern.

#### Epoch Key Rotation without Time Synchronization

> Although epoch keys are distributed with an associated start time, it is nonetheless possible for Nodes that do not maintain a synchronized clock to participate in key rotation. Specifically, upon receiving a new epoch key list from the key distribution Administrator, such a Node can note which of the keys is the current epoch key by comparing their relative start times and using the current epoch key which has the second newest time. It can then use the current key for all locally initiated security interactions until such time as it makes contact with the distribution Administrator again.
>
> This scheme requires the Node to receive epoch keys from the key distribution Administrator at a rate that is at least as fast as the configured *key propagation interval*. The Administrator SHOULD provide a sufficient set of epoch keys to Nodes that do not maintain synchronized time so that they can maintain communication with other group members while a key update is in progress. The key distribution Administrator SHOULD update all Nodes without time, such as [ICDs](#intermittently-connected-device-icd), before the *new epoch key* is activated, and then let Nodes with time all roll to the *new epoch key* at the synchronized start time.

#### Epoch Key Rotation logic

> The full life-cycle of Epoch Key rotation is shown in [Figure 18, “Epoch Key Rotation”](#_bookmark405). For each epoch key slot, the start time of the key is shown as one of the following values:

- **New** - a key with a start time in the future.

- **Current** - the active key with the newest start time.

- **Previous** - the active key with the second newest start time.

- **Old** - an active key with the third newest start time.

> The diagram shows two types of state transitions:

1.  **Admin** - an update of an old key by the Administrator. Changes made during this state transi­ tion are indicated in green.

2.  **Epoch Activate** - activation of an epoch key due to system time becoming greater than the start time. Changes during this state transition are indicated in yellow.

> ![](media/image20.png)
>
> *Figure 18. Epoch Key Rotation*
>
> The Admin Refresh state begins when an entire *group key set* is freshly written to a Node during commissioning or administration, such as when a new group is added. The Epoch Activate state is entered when time progresses to activate a fresh *current epoch key*, aging out the other epoch key slots. The Admin Update state is entered when an Administrator updates an *old epoch key* with a *new epoch key*. When in steady state, the Admin Refresh state MAY be entered in place of an Admin Update state transition to update additional keys to the required ones or to completely reset the group secu­ rity.
>
> Note that in the above diagram, only an example key distribution scheme is illustrated. It is also possible to devise key distribution algorithms that to not rely on time synchronization, or group configurations that never rotate keys in favor or configuring new groups and removing groups and group key sets with expired keys.
>
> **Group Key Set ID**
>
> The Group Key Set ID is a 16-bit field that uniquely identifies the set of epoch keys used for deriva­ tion of an operational group key. Each Group Key Set ID is scoped to a particular Fabric and assigned by an Administrator so as to be unique within a Fabric.
>
> The Group Key Set ID of 0 SHALL be reserved for managing the [Identity Protection Key (IPK)](#_bookmark384) on a given Fabric. It SHALL NOT be possible to remove the IPK Key Set if it exists.

#### Group Session ID

> A *Group Session ID* is a special case of a 16-bit [Session ID](#session-id-16-bits) that is specifically used for group commu­ nication. When [Session Type](#_bookmark230) is 1, denoting a group session, the [Session ID](#session-id-16-bits) SHALL be a *Group Ses­ sion ID* as defined here. The *Group Session ID* identifies probable operational group keys across a Fabric. The *Group Session ID* for a given *operational group key* is derived by treating the output of a [Crypto_KDF](#key-derivation-function-kdf) against the associated Operational Group Key as a big-endian representation of a 16-bit
>
> integer, as follows:

[TABLE]

> where \[\] denotes a zero-length array. For example, given:

- An Operational Group Key value of: a6:f5:30:6b:af:6d:05:0a:f2:3b:a4:bd:6b:9d:d9:60

> After the above derivation following the definition of Crypto_KDF in [Section 3.8, “Key Derivation](#key-derivation-function-kdf) [Function (KDF)”](#key-derivation-function-kdf), the resulting Group Session ID data would be:

- Raw output of GroupKeyHash: b9:f7

- Group Session ID scalar value to be used for further processing: 0xB9F7 (47607 decimal)

> The *Group Session ID* MAY help receiving nodes efficiently locate the *Operational Group Key* used to encrypt an incoming groupcast message. It SHALL NOT be used as the sole means to locate the asso­ ciated *Operational Group Key*, since it MAY collide within the fabric. Instead, the *Group Session ID* provides receiving nodes a means to identify *Operational Group Key* candidates without the need to first attempt to decrypt groupcast messages using all available keys.
>
> On receipt of a message of Group Session Type, all valid, installed, operational group key candidates referenced by the given Group Session ID SHALL be attempted until authentication is passed or there are no more operational group keys to try. This is done because the same Group Session ID might arise from different keys. The chance of a Group Session ID collision is 2⁻¹⁶ but the chance of both a Group Session ID collision and the message MIC matching two different operational group keys is 2⁻⁸⁰.
>
> Group Session Ids are sized to fit within the context of the Session Identifier field of a message. When used in this context, the Group Session ID value allows a receiving Node to identify the appropriate message encryption key to use from the set of active operational keys it has currently
>
> installed.

### Distribution of Key Material

> The operational group keys mechanism relies on a key distribution Administrator to reliably dis­ tribute select epoch key material to appropriate participants. It is assumed the key distribution Administrator is in possession of all epoch keys, has knowledge of the set of group security domain members which require access to those keys, and is responsible for pushing updates of these cre­ dentials to all authorized Nodes in those groups it manages.
>
> Key material is distributed to key holders using the [Group Key Management Cluster](#group-key-management-cluster). In general, the key material of a Node is exposed via Attributes with ACL entries that only allow access by the key distribution Administrator. The information exposed in the [Section 11.2, “Group Key Management](#group-key-management-cluster) [Cluster”](#group-key-management-cluster) includes the group epoch keys and associated group session identifiers.

## Message Counter Synchronization Protocol (MCSP)

> This section describes the protocol used to securely synchronize the message counter used by a
>
> sender of messages encrypted with a symmetric group key.
>
> Message counter synchronization is an essential part of enabling secure messaging between mem­ bers of an operational group. Specifically, it protects against replay attacks, where an attacker replays older messages, which may result in unexpected behavior if accepted and processed by the receiver.
>
> The recipient of a message encrypted with a group key can trust and process that message only if it has kept the last message counter received from a given sender using that key.
>
> Underlying MCSP is a simple request / response protocol. When a multicast message with unknown counter is received, synchronization via MCSP begins by sending a synchronization request via uni­ cast UDP to the multicast message originator’s unicast IPv6 address. That originator then sends a synchronization response to the unsynchronized node via unicast UDP. After cryptographic verifi­ cation, the formerly unsynchronized node is now synchronized with the originator’s message counter and can trust the original and subsequent messages from the originator node.

### Message Counter Synchronization Methods

> There are two methods for synchronizing the message counter of a peer node, which are config­ urable per-group-key based on the [GroupKeySecurityPolicy field](#_bookmark1256) of a given group key set (see [GroupKeySetStruct](#groupkeysetstruct-type)).

#### Trust-first policy

> The first authenticated message counter from an unsynchronized peer is trusted, and its message counter is used to configure message-counter-based replay protection on future messages from that node. All control messages (any message with [C Flag](#_bookmark228) set) use the control message counter and SHALL use Trust-first for synchronization. Note that MCSP is not used for Trust-first synchroniza­ tion.
>
> This policy provides lower latency for less security-sensitive applications such as lighting.
>
> **WARNING** Trust-first synchronization is susceptible to accepting a replayed message after a Node has been rebooted.

#### Cache-and-sync policy

> The message that triggers message counter synchronization is stored, a [message counter synchro­](#message-counter-synchronization-exchange) [nization exchange](#message-counter-synchronization-exchange) is initiated, and only when the synchronization is completed is the original mes­ sage processed. Cache-and-sync provides replay protection even in the case where a Node has been rebooted, at the expense of higher latency.
>
> Support for the cache-and-sync policy and [MCSP](#message-counter-synchronization-exchange) is optional. A node indicates its ability to support this feature via the [Group Key Management](#group-key-management-cluster) cluster [FeatureMap](#features-5).

#### WARNING

> Large groups may cause significant message synchronization burden on the sender and message queueing pressure or latency on the receiver when mes­ sage counter synchronization state is out of sync, such as after a brown-out, on
>
> first message to a new large group, or similar large scale sets of synchroniza­ tions being required at a single point in time.

### Group Peer State

> The *Group Peer State Table* stores information about every peer with which the node had a group message exchange. For every peer node id the following information is available in the table:

- Peer’s Encrypted Group Data Message Counter Status:

  - *Synchronized Data Message Counter* - the largest encrypted data message counter received from the peer, if available.

  - Flag to indicate whether this counter value is valid and synchronized.

  - The *[message reception state](#message-reception-state)* bitmap tracking the recent window of data message counters received from the peer.

- Peer’s Encrypted Group Control Message Counter Status:

  - *Synchronized Control Message Counter* - the largest encrypted control message counter received from the peer, if available.

  - Flag to indicate whether this counter value is valid and synchronized.

  - The [*message reception state*](#message-reception-state) bitmap tracking the recent window of control message counters received from the peer.

> There are three scenarios where the receiver of an encrypted message does not know the sender’s last message counter:

- The encrypted message is the first received from a peer.

- The device rebooted without persisting the *Group Peer State Table* content.

> **NOTE** It is not required to persist the Peer State Table.

- The entry for the Peer in the *Group Peer State Table* was expunged due to the table being full.

> There SHALL be at least 10 entries per supported fabric for Peer Encrypted Group data Message Status in the Group Peer State table. This number SHOULD NOT be less than 5 entries per fabric per instance of Groups cluster on an endpoint. The number of entries is a compromise between the number of peers that can send a group message to a receiver while the table is maintained, and the associated memory usage.
>
> There SHALL be at least 2 entries per supported fabric for Peer Encrypted Group Control Message Status in the Group Peer State table.
>
> The next sections describe the functional protocol used to request message counter synchronization with a peer and form responses to such message counter synchronization requests.

### MCSP Messages

#### MsgCounterSyncReq - Message Counter Synchronization Request

> The Message Counter Synchronization Request (*MsgCounterSyncReq*) message is sent when a mes­ sage was received from a peer whose current message counter is unknown.
>
> A *MsgCounterSyncReq* message SHALL set the [C Flag](#_bookmark228) in the message header. The control message counter SHALL be used for message protection.
>
> A *MsgCounterSyncReq* message SHALL be secured with the group key for which counter synchro­ nization is requested and SHALL set the [Session Type](#_bookmark230) to 1, indicating a group session as per the rules outline in [Section 4.18.5, “Message Counter Synchronization Exchange”](#message-counter-synchronization-exchange).
>
> The payload of the *MsgCounterSyncReq* message takes the format defined in [Table 26, “Message](#_bookmark416) [Counter Sync Request”](#_bookmark416):
>
> *Table 26. Message Counter Sync Request*

[TABLE]

#### MsgCounterSyncRsp - Message Counter Synchronization Response

> The Message Counter Synchronization Response (*MsgCounterSyncRsp*) message is sent in response to a *MsgCounterSyncReq*.
>
> A *MsgCounterSyncRsp* message SHALL set the [C Flag](#_bookmark228) in the message header. The control message counter SHALL be used for message protection.
>
> The *MsgCounterSyncRsp* message has the format defined in [Table 27, “Message Counter Sync](#_bookmark418) [Response”](#_bookmark418):
>
> *Table 27. Message Counter Sync Response*

[TABLE]

### Unsynchronized Message Processing

> An unsynchronized message is one that is cryptographically verified from a node whose message counter is unknown. Upon receipt of an unsynchronized message process the message as follows:

1.  The message SHALL be of [Group Session Type](#_bookmark230), otherwise discard the message.

2.  If [C Flag](#_bookmark228) is set to 1:

    1.  Create a [Message Reception State](#message-reception-state) and set its max_message_counter to the message counter of the given message, i.e. [trust-first](#trust-first-policy).

    2.  Accept the message for further processing.

3.  If [C Flag](#_bookmark228) is set to 0:

    1.  Determine the [GroupKeySecurityPolicy](#_bookmark1256) (as set by the [Section 11.2, “Group Key Management](#group-key-management-cluster) [Cluster”](#group-key-management-cluster)) of the operational group key used to authenticate the message.

    2.  If the key has a *trust-first* security policy, the receiver SHALL:

        1.  Set the peer’s group key data message counter to *Message Counter* of the message.

            1.  Clear the [Message Reception State](#message-reception-state) bitmap for the group session from the peer.

            2.  Mark the peer 's group key data message counter as synchronized.

        2.  Process the message.

    3.  If the key has a *cache-and-sync* security policy, the receiver SHALL:

        1.  If MCSP is not in progress for the given peer Node ID and group key:

            1.  Store the message for later processing.

            2.  Proceed to [Section 4.18.5, “Message Counter Synchronization Exchange”](#message-counter-synchronization-exchange).

        2.  Otherwise, do not process the message.

            1.  An implementation MAY queue the message for later processing after MCSP com­ pletes if resources allow.

> For each peer Node ID and group key pair there SHALL be at most one synchronization exchange outstanding at a time.

### Message Counter Synchronization Exchange

> A message synchronization exchange starts by sending the [MsgCounterSyncReq](#msgcountersyncreq---message-counter-synchronization-request) message to the peer Node that sent the message with unknown message counter. When a synchronization request is triggered by an incoming multicast message, the Node SHALL first wait for a uniformly [random](#deterministic-random-bit-generator-drbg) amount of time between 0 and [MSG_COUNTER_SYNC_REQ_JITTER](#_bookmark319).
>

    1.  The request message SHALL use the same operational group key as the message which trig­ gered synchronization.

    2.  The group key SHALL be known/derivable by both parties (sender and receiver).

> The receiver of *MsgCounterSyncReq* SHALL:

> The receiver of the *MsgCounterSyncRsp* message SHALL:

1.  Verify the *MsgCounterSyncRsp* matches a previously sent *MsgCounterSyncReq*:

    1.  An active synchronization exchange SHALL exist with the source node.

    2.  The *Exchange ID* field SHALL match the *Exchange ID* used for the original *MsgCounterSyn­ cReq* message.

    3.  The *Response* field SHALL match the *Challenge* field used for the original *MsgCounterSyn­ cReq* message.

    5.  Close the synchronization exchange created for the original *MsgCounterSyncReq* message.

### Message Counter Synchronization Session Context

> While conducting Message Counter Synchronization with a peer, nodes SHALL maintain the follow­ ing session context. For nodes initiating message counter synchronization, this context SHALL be maintained throughout the full exchange of *MsgCounterSyncReq* and *MsgCounterSyncRsp* messages. For nodes responding to *MsgCounterSyncReq* messages, the context SHALL only be maintained long enough to generate and successfully transmit the *MsgCounterSyncRsp* message.

1.  Fabric Index: Records the [Index](#fabric-index) for the Fabric within which nodes are conducting message counter synchronization.

    - Fabric Index is derived by identification of an Operational Group Key associated with the fabric through successful decryption with that key and verification of the [Message Integrity](#message-integrity-check-variable-length) [Check](#message-integrity-check-variable-length). For nodes initiating counter synchronization, this occurs at decryption of an inbound groupcast message. For nodes in the responder role, this occurs at decryption of an inbound *MsgCounterSyncReq* message.

2.  Peer Node ID: Records the node ID of the peer with which message counter synchronization is being conducted.

    - For nodes initiating message counter synchronization, this is the node ID of the responder. For nodes responding to message counter synchronization, this is the node ID of the initia­ tor.

3.  Role: Records whether the node is the initiator of or responder to message counter synchroniza­ tion.

    - Together, *Fabric Index*, *Peer Node ID* and *Role* comprise a unique key that can be used to match incoming messages to ongoing MCSP exchanges.

4.  [Message Reception State](#message-reception-state): Provides tracking for the [Control Message Counter](#global-group-encrypted-message-counters) of the remote peer.

5.  Peer IP Address: The unicast IP address of the peer.

6.  Peer Port: The receiving port of the peer.

7.  Operational Group Key: The [Operational Group Key](#group-key-management) that is being used to encrypt messages within the counter synchronization exchange.

8.  Group Session ID: Records the [Group Session ID](#group-session-id) derived from the [Operational Group Key](#group-key-management) that is being used to encrypt messages within the counter synchronization exchange.

### Sequence Diagram

> The following sequence diagram shows an example of how message counter synchronization behaves in the most common scenario.

#### Scenario 1 — Multicast Receiver Initiated

> Assumptions:

- *Sender* transmits a multicast message.

- *Receiver* does not know *Sender* 's message counter.

![](media/image23.png)

> *Figure 21. Multicast Receiver Initiated Message Counter Synchronization*
>
> Sequence:

- *Sender*:

  - Generates, encrypts and sends *Msg1* as a multicast message. *Msg1* could be:

    - Regular message that starts encrypted group communication with receivers *Receiver1*

> and *Receiver2*.

- Receivers *Receiver1* and *Receiver2* each:

  - Receive, decrypt, authenticate, and cache *Msg1* message for later processing.

    - Generate, encrypt, and send *MsgCounterSyncReq* message.

&nbsp;

- *Sender*:

  - Receives *MsgCounterSyncReq* message.

  - Generates, encrypts and sends *MsgCounterSyncRsp* message.

- R1 and R2 each:

  - Receive, decrypt, process, and verify *MsgCounterSyncRsp* message from *Sender*.

  - On verification success: marks *Sender* 's group key message counter as synchronized.

    - Processes cached *Msg1* message.

## Bluetooth Transport Protocol (BTP)

> The Bluetooth Transport Protocol (BTP) provides a TCP-like layer of reliable, connection-oriented data transfer on top of GATT. BTP splits individual Service Data Unit (SDU) messages into multiple BTP segments, which are each transmitted via a single GATT write or indication (as shown in [Figure](#_bookmark424) [22, “MATTERoBLE: Matter Message / BTP layering”](#_bookmark424)).
>
> While BTP is a generic protocol, Matter specifically uses BTP to define a Matter-over-Bluetooth Low Energy (MATTERoBLE) Interface. A MATTERoBLE Interface MUST implement BTP as a universally compatible transport mode. A MATTERoBLE Interface SHALL only be used to transport Matter mes­ sages as the BTP SDU.

![](media/image24.png)

> *Figure 22. MATTERoBLE: Matter Message / BTP layering*
>
> The BTP session handshake allows devices to check BTP protocol version compatibility and exchange other data before a BTP session is established. Once established, this session is used to send and receive BTP SDUs (such as Matter messages) as BTP Message Segments. A BTP session MAY open and close with no effect on the state of the underlying Bluetooth LE connection, except in the case where a BTP session is closed by the Peripheral Device. Either the Peripheral or the Central MAY signal the end of a BTP session by closing the underlying BLE connection.
>
> Due chiefly to constraints put on design by resource-limited BLE chipsets, BTP defines a receive window for each side of a session in units of GATT PDUs. Each GATT Write Characteristic Value (ATT_WRITE_REQ) PDU or Indication (ATT_HANDLE_VALUE_IND) PDU is sent with a sequence num­ ber which the receiver uses to acknowledge receipt of each packet at the BTP layer and open its
>
> receive window from the sender’s perspective.

### BTP Session Interface

> Conceptually, an open BTP session is exposed to the next-higher session layer as a full-duplex mes­ sage stream.

### BTP Frame Format

> A BTP Frame consists of an 8-bit header followed by one or more optional fields, as detailed below. BTP uses little endian encoding for any header fields larger than one byte in length.
>
> [Table 28, “BTP Packet PDU format”](#_bookmark427) defines the BTP Packet PDU format. Unused fields SHALL be set to '0'.
>
> *Table 28. BTP Packet PDU format*

[TABLE]

#### Control Flags

> *Table 29. BTP Control Flags*

[TABLE]

> **H (Handshake) bit (position 6)**
>
> Set to '0' for normal BTP packets. When set, this bit indicates a BTP handshake packet for session establishment and has a different packet format described below.
>
> **M (Management Message) bit (position 5)**
>
> Indicates the presence ('1') or absence ('0') of the Management Opcode field. All segments of a mes­ sage MUST set this bit to the same value.
>
> **A (Acknowledgement) bit (position 3)**
>
> Indicates the presence of the Ack Number field.
>
> **E (Ending Segment) bit (position 2)**
>
> Set to '1' on the last segment of a BTP SDU and set to '0' for all other segments of the same BTP SDU.
>
> A segment MAY have both the Beginning and Ending bits set indicating that a full BTP SDU is included in the message. When set, the segment payload length is equal to the total remaining unre­ ceived message data. When not set, the segment payload length is equal to the maximum allowable BTP session packet size minus header overhead.
>
> **C (Continuing Segment) bit (position 1)**
>
> Set to '0' on the first segment of a BTP SDU and set to '1' for all remaining segments of the same BTP SDU.
>
> **B (Beginning Segment) bit (position 0)**
>
> Set to '1' on the first segment of a BTP SDU and set to '0' for all remaining segments of the same BTP SDU. It indicates the presence of the Message Length field.

#### Ack Number

> Optional field specified in [Section 4.19.4.8, “Packet Acknowledgements”](#packet-acknowledgements).

#### Sequence Number

> Mandatory field for regular data messages specified in [Section 4.19.4.6, “Sequence Numbers”](#sequence-numbers).

#### Message Length

> Optional field present in Beginning Segment only. Value indicates the length in bytes of the full mes­ sage buffer to be transmitted. None of the BTP Packet PDU fields is included in the Message Length.

#### Segment Payload

> Optional field containing a segment of the Service Data Unit (SDU) message in transmission to the receiver.

### BTP Control Frames

> BTP defines different control frame formats depending on the Management Opcode that is in the BTP Packet PDU header. Valid Management Opcodes for BTP Control Frames are defined in [Table](#_bookmark429) [30, “BTP Control codes”](#_bookmark429).
>
> *Table 30. BTP Control codes*

[TABLE]

#### BTP Handshake Request

> *Table 31. BTP Handshake Request format*

[TABLE]

[TABLE]

> **H (Handshake) bit**
>
> Set to '1' for connection handshake messages.
>
> **M (Management) bit**
>
> Set to '1' for connection handshake messages.
>
> **Ver\[i\] (Version) nibbles**
>
> Used to negotiate the highest version capability between a Device pair. Supported versions are listed once each, newest first, in descending order. Unused version fields are filled with ‘0’.
>
> The following values are defined:

- 0 — Unused field

- 4 — BTP as defined by Matter v1.0

> **Requested ATT_MTU**
>
> Requested ATT_MTU is a 16-bit unsigned integer field containing the size of the GATT PDU (ATT_MTU) that can be received by the sender minus the size of the GATT header (3). This value is obtained via the standard ATT MTU exchange procedure (see [Bluetooth® Core Specification 4.2](#_bookmark20) Vol 3, Part F, Section 3.4.2 "MTU Exchange") and is used to validate that both sides of the BLE connec­ tion are using the common minimum value. If BTP is not aware of the negotiated GATT MTU, the value SHALL be set to '23', indicating the minimum ATT_MTU defined by GATT. If the client has no preference, the value may be set to '0'.
>
> **NOTE** Each GATT PDU used by the BTP protocol introduces 3 byte header overhead mak­ ing the maximum BTP Segment Size for the session equal to negotiated ATT_MTU-3.
>
> **Client Window Size**
>
> Value of the maximum receive window size supported by the server, specified in units of BTP pack­ ets where each packet may be up to 244 bytes in length. This maximum was chosen so a single BTP segment can fit into a single 255 byte BLE link layer PDU, including all headers from the link layer, L2CAP, GATT, and BTP.

#### BTP Handshake Response

> *Table 32. BTP Handshake Response format*

[TABLE]

> **H (Handshake) bit**
>
> Set to '1' for session handshake messages.
>
> **M (Management) bit**
>
> Set to '1' for session handshake messages.
>
> **Final Protocol Version**
>
> Value of the BTP protocol version selected by the server.
>
> **Reserved**
>
> Must be set to '0'.
>
> **Selected ATT_MTU**
>
> Value of the maximum ATT_MTU for the connection selected by the server as a 16-bit unsigned inte­ ger.
>
> **Selected Window Size**
>
> Value of the maximum receive window size supported by the server, specified in units of BTP pack­ ets where each packet may be up to the selected segment size in length.

### BTP GATT Service

#### BTP Channelization

> Bluetooth Transport Protocol provides a packetized stream interface over GATT but says nothing about the actual contents of the data packets it transports. The BTP Service UUID is used to specify the actual contents of the packets (see [Table 33, “BTP Service UUID”](#_bookmark433)).

>
> While a single BTP connection may exist between a BTP Client and BTP Server, multiple BTP ses­ sions may be established between various peers.

#### BTP GATT Service

> The BTP GATT service is composed of a service with three characteristics—C1, C2 and C3 (see [Table](#_bookmark434) [34, “BTP GATT service”](#_bookmark434)). The client SHALL exclusively use C1 to initiate BTP sessions by sending BTP handshake requests and send data to the server via GATT ATT_WRITE_REQ PDUs. While a client is subscribed to allow indications over C2, the server SHALL exclusively use C2 to respond to BTP handshake requests and send data to the client via GATT ATT_HANDLE_VALUE_IND PDUs.
>
> *Table 34. BTP GATT service*

[TABLE]

> For all messages sent from the BTP Client to BTP Server, BTP SHALL use the GATT Write Character­ istic Value sub-procedure. For all messages sent from the BTP Server to BTP Client, BTP SHALL use the GATT Indications sub-procedure.
>
> The values of C1 and C2 SHALL both be limited to a maximum length of 247 bytes. This constraint is imposed to align with maximum PDU size when LE Data Packet Length Extensions (DPLE) is enabled on Bluetooth 4.2 hardware. Per [Bluetooth® Core Specification 4.2](#_bookmark20) Vol 3, Part F, Section 3.2.9 "Long Attribute Values", the maximum characteristic value length is 512 bytes. The maximum lengths of C1 and C2 may increase in a future version of the BTP specification to allow higher throughput on BLE connections whose ATT_MTU exceeds 247 bytes.
>
> C3 is an optional characteristic that the server MAY use to include additional data required during the provisioning as defined in [Section 5.4.2.5.7, “GATT-based Additional Data”](#_bookmark524).
>
> BTP Clients SHALL perform certain GATT operations synchronously, including GATT discovery, sub­ scribe, and unsubscribe operations. GATT discovery, subscribe, or unsubscribe SHALL NOT be initi­ ated while the result of a previous operation remains outstanding. This requirement is imposed by GATT protocol.

#### Session Establishment

> Before a BTP session can be initiated, a central SHALL first establish a BLE connection to a periph­ eral. Once a BLE connection has been formed, centrals SHALL assume the GATT client role for BTP session establishment and data transfer, and peripherals SHALL assume the GATT server role. If peripheral supports LE Data Packet Length Extension (DPLE) feature it SHOULD perform data length update procedure before establishing a GATT connection.
>
> Before establishing a BTP session, the GATT client SHOULD perform a GATT Exchange MTU proce­ dure.
>
> After that the BTP Client SHALL execute the GATT discovery procedure. The GATT discovery proce­ dure starts with primary service discovery using either the GATT Discover All Primary Services sub- procedure or the GATT Discover Primary Services by Service UUID sub-procedure.
>
> The BTP Client SHALL perform either the GATT Discover All Characteristics of a Service sub-proce­ dure or the GATT Discover Characteristics by UUID sub-procedure in order to discover the C1 and C2 characteristics.
>
> The BTP Client SHALL perform the GATT Discover All Characteristic Descriptors sub-procedure in order to discover the Client Characteristic Configuration descriptor (CCCD) of C2 characteristic.
>
> To initiate a BTP session, a BTP Client SHALL send a BTP handshake request packet to the BTP Server via a ATT_WRITE_REQ PDU on characteristic C1 of the BTP Service. The handshake request packet SHALL include, a list of BTP protocol versions supported by the client, the client’s GATT ATT_MTU, and the client’s maximum receive window size. The list of supported protocol versions SHALL be sorted in descending numerical order. If the client cannot determine the BLE connec­ tion’s ATT_MTU, it SHALL specify a value of '23' (the minimum ATT_MTU supported by GATT) for this field in the handshake request. For a detailed specification of the handshake request binary data format, see [Section 4.19.3.1, “BTP Handshake Request”](#btp-handshake-request).
>
> After the BTP Client acknowledges delivery of the handshake request packet, upon receipt of a GATT Write Response, the BTP Client SHALL enable indications over C2 characteristics by writing value 0x01 to C2’s Client Characteristic Configuration descriptor as described in [Bluetooth® Core](#_bookmark20) [Specification 4.2](#_bookmark20) Vol 3, Part C, Section 10.3.1.1 "Handling GATT Indications and Notifications".
>
> Once the GATT server has received a client’s BTP handshake request and confirmed the client’s sub­ scription to C2, it SHALL send a BTP handshake response to the client via a ATT_HANDLE_VAL­ UE_IND PDU on C2. This response SHALL contain the window size, maximum BTP packet size, and BTP protocol version selected by the server. For a detailed specification of the handshake response binary data format, see [Section 4.19.3.2, “BTP Handshake Response”](#btp-handshake-response).
>
> The server SHALL select a window size equal to the minimum of its and the client’s maximum win­ dow sizes. Likewise, the server SHALL select a maximum BTP Segment Size for the BLE connection by taking the minimum of 244 bytes (the maximum characteristic value length of C1 and C2), server’s ATT_MTU-3 and ATT_MTU-3 as declared by the client.
>
> The server SHALL select a BTP protocol version that is the newest which it and the client both sup­ port, where newer protocol version numbers are strictly larger than those of older versions. The version number returned in the handshake response SHALL determine the version of the BTP pro­ tocol used by client and server for the duration of the session.
>
> If the server determines that it and the client do not share a supported BTP protocol version, the server SHALL close its BLE connection to the client. When a client sends a handshake request, it SHALL start a timer with a globally-defined duration of BTP_CONN_RSP_TIMEOUT seconds. If this timer expires before the client receives a handshake response from the server, the client SHALL close the BTP session and report an error to the application. Likewise, a server SHALL start a timer with the same duration when it receives a handshake request from a client. If this timer expires
>
> before the server receives a subscription request on C2, the server SHALL close the BTP session and report an error to the application. The state machine in [Figure 23, “BTP session handshake”](#_bookmark435) illus­ trates the function of these timers as part of the BTP session establishment procedure.

> *Figure 23. BTP session handshake*

#### Data Transmission

> Once a BTP session has been established, the next-higher-layer application on both peers may use this BLE connection to send and receive data via GATT writes or indications, according to a peer’s GATT role. Clients SHALL exclusively use GATT Write Characteristic Value sub-procedure to send data to servers and servers SHALL exclusively use GATT Indication sub-procedure to send data to clients.
>
> All BTP packets sent on an open BLE connection SHALL adhere to the BTP Packet PDU binary data format specified in BTP Frame Formats. All BTP packets SHALL include a header flags byte and an 8-bit unsigned sequence number. All other packet fields are optional. These optional fields include an 8-bit unsigned received packet acknowledgement number, 16-bit unsigned buffer length indica­ tion, and variable-length buffer segment payload.
>
> This section is defined entirely within the scope of a single BTP session. Concurrent BTP sessions between the same peer and multiple remote hosts SHALL maintain separate and independent acknowledgement timers, sequence numbers, and receive windows.

#### Message Segmentation and Reassembly

> When the session layer (that is, MATTERoBLE) sends a Matter Message as a BTP SDU over a BTP ses­ sion, that BTP SDU SHALL be split into ordered, non-overlapping BTP segments so the set of all BTP segments may be reassembled into the original BTP SDU (see [Figure 22, “MATTERoBLE: Matter Mes­](#_bookmark424)
>
> [sage / BTP layering”](#_bookmark424)). Each BTP segment SHALL be prepended with a BTP packet header and sent as the payload of a single GATT PDU. If a BTP SDU is split into more than one BTP segment, the BTP segments SHALL be sent in order of their position in the original BTP SDU, starting with the BTP segment at the buffer’s head.
>
> At any point in time, only one BTP SDU may be transmitted in each direction over a BTP session. The transmission of BTP segments of any two BTP SDUs SHALL NOT overlap. If the application attempts to send one BTP SDU while transmission of another BTP SDU is in progress, the new BTP SDU SHALL be appended to a first-in, first-out queue. The next BTP SDU SHALL be dequeued from this queue and transmitted once transmission of the current BTP SDU completes, that is, once all BTP segments of the current BDP SDU have been transmitted and received by the peer via GATT.
>
> The first BTP segment of a BTP SDU sent over a BTP session SHALL have its Beginning Segment header flag set to indicate the beginning of a new BTP SDU (see [Table 28, “BTP Packet PDU format”](#_bookmark427)). The presence of this flag SHALL indicate the further presence of a 16-bit unsigned integer field, the Message Length, that provides the receiver with the total length of the BTP SDU. The last BTP seg­ ment for a given BTP SDU SHALL have its Ending Segment flag set to indicate the end of the trans­ mitted BTP SDU. A BTP packet that bears an unsegmented BTP SDU—that is, a BTP SDU small enough to fit into a single BTP segment—SHALL have both its Beginning Segment and Ending Seg­ ment flags set.
>
> The size of a single BTP SDU sent via BTP is limited to 64KB, that is, the maximum size of the Mes­ sage Length field in the BTP packet header. The number of segments used to send a buffer is unlim­ ited and delimited by the Beginning Segment and Ending Segment bits in the BTP packet header. The upper layer imposes more stringent requirements over the maximum SDU size, such as [Section](#message-size-requirements) [4.4.4, “Message Size Requirements”](#message-size-requirements).
>
> The length of the data payload in each BTP segment whose Ending Segment bit is not set SHALL be equal to the session’s maximum BTP packet size minus the size of that packet’s header. If a packet’s Ending Segment bit is set, the length of its BTP segment data payload SHALL equal the size of the original BTP SDU minus the total size of all previously transmitted BTP segments of that BTP SDU. In this way, the length of a SDU’s last BTP segment is implied by its size.
>
> Once a peer receives a complete set of BTP segments, it SHALL reassemble them in the order received, and verify that the reassembled BTP SDU’s total length matches that specified by the Beginning Segment’s Message Length value. If they match, the receiver SHALL pass the reassem­ bled BTP SDU up to the next-higher-layer. If the reassembled buffer’s length does not match that specified by the sender, or if received BTP segment payload size would exceed the maximum BTP packet size, or receiver receives an Ending Segment without the presence of a previous Beginning Segment, or a Beginning Segment when another BTP SDU’s transmission is already in progress, the receiver BTP SHALL close the BTP session and report an error to the application.

#### Sequence Numbers

> All BTP packets SHALL be sent with sequence numbers, regardless of whether they contain SDU segments (for example, a packet acknowledgement with no attached segment payload). The pur­ pose of sequence numbers is to facilitate the BTP receive window. A BTP sequence number SHALL be defined as an unsigned 8-bit integer value that monotonically increments by 1 with each packet sent by a given peer. A sequence number incremented past 255 SHALL wrap to zero.
>
> Sequence numbers SHALL be separately defined for either direction of a BTP session. The sequence number of the first packet sent by the client after completion of the BTP session handshake SHALL be zero. The server’s BTP handshake response bears an implied sequence number of zero because it occupies a slot in the client’s receive window. The client acknowledges the server’s BTP hand­ shake response with an acknowledgement sequence of zero. For this reason, the sequence number of the first data packet sent by the server after completion of the BTP session handshake SHALL be 1.
>
> Peers SHALL check to ensure that all received BTP packets properly increment the sender’s previ­ ous sequence number by 1. If this check fails, the peer SHALL close the BTP session and report an error to the application.

#### Receive Windows

> The purpose of the receive window is to enable flow control at the GATT session layer between BTP peers.
>
> Flow control is required at the GATT transport layer for embedded platforms that use "minimal" BLE chipsets. These platforms may have limited space on the host processor to receive packets from their BLE chipsets. In the case of some dual-chip architectures, writes and indications are received and confirmed by the BLE chip with no input from the host processor. When the BLE chip sends the result of a received GATT PDU to the host processor, that payload and the corresponding BTP packet will be permanently lost if the host does not have enough space to receive it. For this reason, knowl­ edge of a remote host’s ability to reliably receive GATT PDUs is presented at the transport layer in the form of the BTP receive window.
>
> Both peers in a BTP session SHALL define a receive window, where the window’s size indicates the number of GATT PDUs (that is, BTP segments) a peer can reliably receive and store without session- layer acknowledgment. A maximum window size SHALL be established for both peers as part of the BTP session handshake. To prevent sequence number wrap-around, the largest maximum win­ dow size any peer may support is 255.
>
> Both peers SHALL maintain a counter to reflect the current size of the remote peer’s receive win­ dow. Each peer SHALL decrement this counter when it sends a packet via GATT write or indication and increment this counter when a sent packet is acknowledged.
>
> If a local peer’s counter for a remote peer’s receive window is zero, the window SHALL be consid­ ered closed, and the local peer SHALL NOT send packets until the window reopens (is incremented above zero). When a closed window reopens, a local peer SHALL immediately resume any pending BTP packet transmission.
>
> A local peer SHALL also not send packets if the remote peer’s receive window has one slot open and the local peer does not have a pending packet acknowledgement. This is to avoid the situation where the receive windows of both peers are full and neither can send an acknowledgement to reopen its window for the other. Because the server’s handshake response bears an implicit BTP sequence number of zero, a server SHALL initialize its counter for the client’s receive window size at (negotiated maximum window size - 1). A client SHALL initialize its counter for the server’s receive window at the negotiated maximum window size.
>
> Both peers SHALL also keep a counter of their own receive window size based on the sequence
>
> number difference between the last packet they received and the last packet they acknowledged. This counter is used to proactively send early packet acknowledgements when a peer’s own receive window is about to close. See [Section 4.19.4.8, “Packet Acknowledgements”](#packet-acknowledgements) for details.
>
> An example scenario involving BTP receive windows is depicted in [Figure 24, “Example receive](#_bookmark437) [window scenario”](#_bookmark437), complete with packet acknowledgements as specified in [Section 4.19.4.8, “Packet](#packet-acknowledgements) [Acknowledgements”](#packet-acknowledgements). In this scenario, the client transmits a three-segment buffer to the server once it receives the server’s handshake request. The handshake request occupies one slot in the client’s initial receive window. The server’s initial receive window is empty. Both client and server have a maximum window size of 4.

> *Figure 24. Example receive window scenario*

#### Packet Acknowledgements

> The purpose of sequence numbers and packet receipt acknowledgements is to support the BTP receive window and provide a keep-alive signal when a session is idle to affirm the health and con­ tinued operation of a remote BTP stack.
>
> Per BTP Frame Formats, BTP packet receipt acknowledgements SHALL be received as unsigned 8- bit integer values in the header of a BTP packet. The value of this field SHALL indicate the sequence number of the acknowledged packet.
>
> Acknowledgement of a sequence number indicates acknowledgement of the previous sequence number, if it too is unacknowledged. By induction, acknowledgement of a given packet implies acknowledgement of all packets received on the same BTP session prior to the acknowledged packet.
>
> An acknowledgement is invalid if the acknowledged sequence number does not correspond to an outstanding, unacknowledged BTP packet sequence number. In contrast to TCP, BTP acks are not "free." A stand-alone ack—that is, a BTP packet that contains a packet receipt acknowledgement value but no buffer segment payload—consumes a slot in a remote peer’s window just like any other packet. Stand-alone acknowledgement packets SHALL be acknowledged by a remote peer. The implications of this are examined in [Section 4.19.4.9, “Idle Connection State”](#idle-connection-state).
>
> Each peer SHALL maintain an acknowledgement-received timer. When a peer sends any BTP packet, it SHALL start this timer if it is not already running. The timer’s duration SHALL be globally defined as BTP_ACK_TIMEOUT seconds, referred to as the acknowledgement timeout interval.
>
> A peer SHALL restart its acknowledgement-received timer when a valid acknowledgement is received for any but its most recently sent unacknowledged packet. A peer SHALL stop its acknowl­ edgement-received timer if it receives an acknowledgement for its most recently sent unacknowl­ edged packet. If a peer’s acknowledgement-received timer expires, or if a peer receives an invalid acknowledgement, the peer SHALL close the BTP session and report an error to the application.
>
> Because the server’s handshake response bears an implicit BTP sequence number of zero, a server SHALL start its acknowledgement-received timer when it sends a handshake response.
>
> Each peer SHALL also maintain a send-acknowledgement timer. When it receives any BTP packet, a peer SHALL record the packet’s sequence number as the corresponding BTP session’s pending acknowledgement value and start the send-acknowledgement timer if it is not already running. The timer’s duration timer SHALL be defined as any value less than one-half the acknowledgement timeout interval. This ensures that on a healthy BLE connection, a peer will always receive acknowledgements for sent packets before its acknowledgement-received timer expires.
>
> A peer SHALL stop its send-acknowledgement timer when any pending acknowledgement is sent, either as a stand-alone BTP packet or piggybacked onto an outgoing buffer segment. If this timer expires and the peer has a pending acknowledgement, the peer SHALL immediately send that acknowledgement. If the peer sends any packet before this timer expires, it SHALL piggyback any pending acknowledgement on the transmitted packet and stop the send-acknowledgement timer.
>
> Because the server’s handshake response bears an implicit BTP sequence number of zero, a client SHALL set its pending acknowledgement value to zero and start its send-acknowledgement timer when it receives the server’s a handshake response. Operation of the send-acknowledgement and acknowledgement-received timers is illustrated in [Figure 26, “BTP session lifecycle for Central act­](#_bookmark442) [ing as GATT Client”](#_bookmark442) in [Section 4.19.4.11, “Protocol State Diagrams”](#protocol-state-diagrams).
>
> If a peer detects that its receive window has shrunk to two or fewer free slots, it SHALL immedi­ ately send any pending acknowledgement as a stand-alone BTP packet. This prevents the session from stalling in the interval between when a peer’s receive window becomes empty and when its send-acknowledgement timer would normally fire.

#### Idle Connection State

> When neither side of a BTP session has data to send, BTP packets will still be exchanged every send- acknowledgement interval due to acknowledgements generated by the receipt of previous data or stand-alone acknowledgement packets, as discussed in [Section 4.19.4.8, “Packet Acknowledge­](#packet-acknowledgements) [ments”](#packet-acknowledgements). The behavior of the acknowledgement-received timer in this scenario doubles as a keep-
>
> alive mechanism, as it will cause a peer to close a BLE connection automatically if the remote BTP stack crashes or becomes unresponsive. This scenario is illustrated in [Figure 25, “Idle connection](#_bookmark440) [scenario”](#_bookmark440).

![](media/image27.jpeg)

> *Figure 25. Idle connection scenario*

#### Connection Shutdown

> To close a BTP session, a GATT client SHALL unsubscribe from characteristic C2. The GATT server SHALL take this action to indicate closure of any BTP session open to the client.
>
> If a BTP Server needs to close the BTP session, it SHALL terminate its BLE connection to the client.

## Check-In Protocol

> The goal of the Check-In Protocol is to provide a way for a server to notify a client of an event or state outside of a secure session in a private and secure fashion.
>
> Some of the events or states to be shared with a client are defined by different Check-in Protocol Use Cases. The current list includes:

- An [ICD](#intermittently-connected-device-icd) is available for communication.

> The Check-In Protocol is a set of requirements and processes that can be re-used by multiple Check- In Protocol use cases. Multiple Check-In Protocol use cases can coexist on a single device. The Check-In Protocol sends a sessionless message (Check-In message) that relies on a key that has been
>
> given to the server during the registration of the client.

### Requirements

#### Server Requirements

> A Server use case of the Check-In Protocol SHALL implement these requirements.

- A persistent data store for Keys.

- An implementation of the [Check-In Counter](#check-in-counter).

> **Persistent Data Store**
>
> For the Check-In Protocol to be effective, the use case of the protocol SHALL provide a means to store and persist client registration information. The minimum information that SHALL be stored and persisted is the key to use during the encryption process of the Check-In message.

#### Client Requirements

> The server does not store the starting value of the [Check-In Counter](#check-in-counter) for a given key. Therefore, it is the client’s responsibility to do so when the client registers with the server. A Client use case of the Check-In Protocol SHALL implement a means to store sets containing a key, the starting value of [Check-In Counter](#check-in-counter) and the last known valid offset from the starting value of the [Check-In Counter](#check-in-counter). A Key that has been used to register for Check-In messages SHALL always be associated with a start­ ing [Check-In Counter](#check-in-counter) value and the last known valid offset from the starting [Check-In Counter](#check-in-counter) value.
>
> During the decryption process, the client uses the key, its associated starting [Check-In Counter](#check-in-counter) value and offset to decrypt and authenticate a received Check-In message.

### Message Content

> *Table 37. Check-In Payload*

[TABLE]

#### Nonce

> The nonce used to encrypt the encrypted fields of the payload SHALL be the first [CRYPTO_AEAD­](#data-confidentiality-and-integrity)
>
> [\_NONCE_LENGTH_BYTES](#data-confidentiality-and-integrity) bytes of the message payload. The nonce is included in plaintext.

#### Encrypted Section

> The encrypted section SHALL be a concatenation of the following, in order:

1.  The [Check-In Counter](#check-in-counter) value used in the encryption process, represented as a 4-byte little-endian value.

2.  The Application Data, if used by the use case.

> **Check-In Counter**
>
> The [Check-In Counter](#check-in-counter) value SHALL be used to generate the nonce. This value SHALL be provided by the Check-In Protocol use case.
>
> **Application Data**
>
> The application data is defined and provided by the Check-In Protocol use case. The Check-In Proto­ col use case is not required to use application data. If application data is not used for a specific use- case, creation of a Check-In message SHALL use a zero-length byte array for the application data.

#### MIC

> Message integrity check generated by the AEAD is appended after the encrypted section. It SHALL be the last [CRYPTO_AEAD_MIC_LENGTH_BYTES](#data-confidentiality-and-integrity) bytes.

### Algorithms

> The Check-In message is a sessionless message, since one of the goals of the protocol is to provide a means to recover a secure session that was lost. Since no session keys are available to encrypt the entire message, the encryption of the Check-In message is limited to part of the payload.
>
> The inputs provided to the encryption process by the Check-In protocol use case are:

1.  The value of [Check-In Counter](#check-in-counter) represented as 4-byte little-endian value. In the following steps, we assume the counter value is in the correct format.

2.  The application data bytes represented as a byte array. In the following steps, we assume the application data is in the correct format.

3.  A symmetric encryption key represented as a [CRYPTO_SYMMETRIC_KEY_LENGTH_BYTES](#data-confidentiality-and-integrity)-byte array. In the following steps, we assume the key is in the correct format.

#### Nonce Generation

> To generate the nonce, the Check-In message SHALL use the [Keyed-Hash Message Authentication](#keyed-hash-message-authentication-code-hmac) [Code](#keyed-hash-message-authentication-code-hmac) algorithm. The inputs of the algorithm SHALL be the key and the [Check-In Counter](#check-in-counter) value. Both will be provided by the Check-In Protocol use case. From the generated hash, the nonce SHALL be the first [CRYPTO_AEAD_NONCE_LENGTH_BYTES](#data-confidentiality-and-integrity) bytes to match the AEAD requirements.

[TABLE]

[TABLE]

#### Authenticated encryption

> The payload of the Check-In message SHALL be encrypted using the [AEAD](#data-confidentiality-and-integrity) function. The inputs of the algorithm SHALL be the generated [nonce](#nonce-generation), the key and the plaintext to encrypt. The additional data field SHALL NOT be used.

[TABLE]

#### Client Counter Validation

> When receiving a Check-In message, the client SHALL verify the received counter by executing the following steps.

1.  Subtract the stored starting value of the counter from the value provided in the Check-In mes­ sage. The subtraction SHALL be done as unsigned integers mod 2³². This ensures that even if the subtraction rolls over, it will still produce the correct offset.

2.  If the stored last known offset from the stored starting value of the counter is smaller than the value from step 1, the verification SHALL return TRUE.

3.  Otherwise the verification SHALL return FALSE.

#### Key Refreshing

> A given key is only valid for one set of values of the [Check-In Counter](#check-in-counter). A key becomes invalid once all the [Check-In Counter](#check-in-counter) values for that key have been used. The tracking of the used Check-In counter values is done as part of the [decryption procedure](#decryption-procedure).
>
> To avoid reuse of a nonce value with a given key, the key (shared secret) needs to be refreshed before all the valid [Check-In Counter](#check-in-counter) values for that key have been used. If a [Check-In Counter](#check-in-counter) value is reused with the same key, the Check-In messages reusing the counter will be discarded. To avoid the situation where the relationship is broken because of a rollover, we are prescribing when a client should refresh its entry.
>
> **Key Refresh Validation**
>
> When a client receives a Check-In message with a [Check-In Counter](#check-in-counter) value indicating that 2³¹ counter values have been used, the client SHALL refresh its entry with a new key. The client SHALL determine if a key refresh is necessary by executing the following steps.

1.  Check whether the stored counter offset is greater than or equal to 2³¹.

2.  If the stored counter offset is greater than or equal to 2³¹, a key refresh is required.

3.  Otherwise, a key refresh is allowed, but not required.

### Protocol Operation

#### Encryption Procedure

> When sending a Check-In message, the server SHALL encrypt the application payload (ie. [Check-In](#check-in-counter) [Counter](#check-in-counter) and application data provided) following these steps. If the encryption procedure fails to generate the Check-In message, the server SHALL NOT send the associated Check-In message.

1.  The server SHALL generate the nonce as described in [Section 4.20.3.1, “Nonce Generation”](#nonce-generation).

    1.  If the generation failed, the encryption procedure SHALL return FAILURE.

    2.  If the generation succeeded, the server SHALL continue from step 2.

2.  The server SHALL encrypt the plaintext as described in [Section 4.20.3.2, “Authenticated encryp­](#authenticated-encryption) [tion”](#authenticated-encryption).

    1.  The plaintext SHALL be a concatenation of the following, in order :

        1.  The [Check-In Counter](#check-in-counter) value used in the encryption process and

        2.  the Application Data, if used by the use case.

    2.  If the encryption fails, the encryption procedure SHALL return FAILURE.

    3.  If the encryption succeeds, the server SHALL continue from step 3.

3.  The server SHALL create the payload string by concatenating the nonce and the output of the AEAD function.

#### Decryption Procedure

> When a client receives a Check-In message, the client SHALL decrypt and process the message fol­ lowing these steps:

1.  The client SHALL break down the message into the nonce and the ciphertext/MIC.

2.  The client SHALL try to decrypt the message with the key associated to the server being tested. When a client has multiple associated servers, the client iterates through this process for the keys associated to each potential server until the keys associated to all possible servers fail or a successful key is found.

    1.  If the decryption succeeds, the device associated with the key is identified as the server checking in. The client SHALL continue from step 3.

    2.  If the decryption fails, the client SHALL move on to the next candidate server key per step 2, or discard the message if there are no remaining registered server keys to try.

3.  From the plaintext, the client SHALL retrieve the [Check-In Counter](#check-in-counter) and the application data if present.

4.  The client SHALL verify that the received nonce is valid by calculating it as described in [Section](#nonce-generation) [4.20.3.1, “Nonce Generation”](#nonce-generation) from the received [Check-In Counter](#check-in-counter) and the key. The counter value retrieved in the previous step is already in the correct encoding.

    1.  If the calculated nonce matches the received nonce, the client SHALL continue from step 5.

    2.  If the calculated nonce doesn’t match the received nonce, the client SHALL discard the mes­ sage.

5.  The client SHALL verify that the received [Check-In Counter](#check-in-counter) is valid as described in [Section](#client-counter-validation) [4.20.3.3, “Client Counter Validation”](#client-counter-validation). The [Check-In Counter](#check-in-counter) is converted into a unsigned 32-bit integer.

    1.  If the received counter value is valid, the client SHALL continue from step 6.

    2.  If the received counter value is invalid, the client SHALL discard the message.

6.  The client SHALL store the offset between the received [Check-In Counter](#check-in-counter) value and the stored starting value of the [Check-In Counter](#check-in-counter). The subtraction SHALL be done as unsigned integers mod 2³². The client SHALL continue from step 7.

7.  The client SHALL verify if a key refresh is necessary as described in [Section 4.20.3.4.1, “Key](#_bookmark460) [Refresh Validation”](#_bookmark460).

    1.  If a key refresh is necessary, the client SHALL trigger an attempt to [refresh the key](#key-refreshing), unless the client is already in the process of refreshing this specific key for this specific server. The client SHALL continue from step 8 whether the [key refresh](#key-refreshing) succeeds or not.

    2.  If a key refresh is not necessary, the client SHALL continue from step 8.

8.  The client SHALL notify the application that the server has checked-in. What this behavior implies is application specific.

# Chapter 5. Commissioning

## Onboarding Payload

> The purpose of this section is to define the contents of the Onboarding Payload needed to allow onboarding a device into a Matter network. It also specifies the representation and encoding of said payload as a QR Code, as a manually entered code, and as content in an NFC tag.

### Onboarding Payload Contents

> The Onboarding Payload is composed of required and optional information which will be used by the Commissioner to ensure interoperability between commissioners and devices and provide a consistent user experience. Some or all of this content will be encoded into different formats, some human-readable (such as numeric string) and machine-readable (such as QR code and NFC) for­ mats for printing or display on or integration into the device. The following are the elements that may be used in an Onboarding Payload for a Matter device.

#### Version

> A version indication provides versioning of the payload and SHALL be included. Version for machine-readable formats is 3 bits with an initial version of 0b000. Version for Manual Pairing Code is 1 bit with an initial version of 0b0.
>
> *Rationale*: This allows a way to introduce changes to the payload as needed going into the future.

#### Vendor ID and Product ID

> [Vendor ID](#vendor-identifier-vendor-id-vid) and [Product ID](#product-identifier-product-id-pid), each a 16-bit value, SHALL be included in machine-readable formats and MAY be included in the Manual Pairing Code.
>
> *Rationale*: This allows a way to identify the make and model of the device, which is used further
>
> during the commissioning flow, such as during the [Device Attestation procedure](#device-attestation-procedure). These unique identifiers also help to retrieve device model metadata like product name, product description, and firmware update URL from the [Distributed Compliance Ledger](#distributed-compliance-ledger), as well as information relevant to the commissioning flow (see [Section 5.7, “Device Commissioning Flows”](#device-commissioning-flows)).

#### Custom Flow

> A 2-bit unsigned enumeration specifying the [Device Commissioning Flow](#device-commissioning-flows) SHALL be included in machine-readable formats. For the encoding of Custom Flow in the Manual Pairing Code, see [Sec­](#_bookmark478) [tion 5.1.4.1.2, “Custom Flow for Manual Pairing Code”](#_bookmark478).
>
> *Rationale*: This guides the Commissioner as to whether steps are needed before commissioning can
>
> take place.

- A value of 0 indicates that no steps are needed (apart from powering the device).

- A value of 1 indicates that user interaction with the device (pressing a button, for example) is required before commissioning can take place. The specific steps required can be found in the [CommissioningModeInitialStepsHint](#commissioningmodeinitialstepshint) field of the [Distributed Compliance Ledger](#distributed-compliance-ledger) for the given Vendor ID and Product ID.

&nbsp;

- A value of 2 indicates that additional interactions described in [Section 5.7.3, “Custom Commis­](#custom-commissioning-flow) [sioning Flow”](#custom-commissioning-flow) are required for initial device setup in order to be successfully commissioned by any Commissioner.

#### Discovery Capabilities Bitmask

> An 8-bit capabilities bitmask SHALL be included in machine-readable formats.
>
> *Rationale*: The Discovery Capabilities Bitmask contains information about the device’s available technologies for device discovery (see [Section 5.4, “Device Discovery”](#device-discovery)).

#### Discriminator value

> A Discriminator SHALL be included as a 12-bit unsigned integer, which SHALL match the value which a device advertises during commissioning. Manufacturers SHALL NOT use a common dis­ criminator value for all devices, to allow a commissioner to distinguish between multiple advertis­ ing devices. It is RECOMMENDED that manufacturers use sequential generation with rollover for devices that might be sold or purchased in a multi-pack in order to reduce the chance of discrimi­ nator collision between devices in the same pack.
>
> For machine-readable formats, the full 12-bit Discriminator is used. For the Manual Pairing Code, only the upper 4 bits out of the 12-bit Discriminator are used.
>
> *Rationale*: The Discriminator value helps to further identify potential devices during the setup
>
> process and helps to improve the speed and robustness of the setup experience for the user.

#### Passcode

> A Passcode SHALL be included as a 27-bit unsigned integer, which serves as proof of possession dur­ ing commissioning. The 27-bit unsigned integer encodes an 8-digit decimal numeric value, and therefore SHALL be restricted to the values 0x0000001 to 0x5F5E0FE (00000001 to 99999998 in decimal), excluding the [invalid Passcode](#invalid-passcodes) values.
>
> *Rationale*: The Passcode establishes proof of possession and is also used as the shared secret in set­ ting up the initial secure channel over which further onboarding steps take place.

#### TLV Data

> Variable-length TLV data using the TLV format MAY be included in machine-readable formats pro­ viding optional information. More details about the TLV can be found in [Section 5.1.5, “TLV Con­](#tlv-content) [tent”](#tlv-content).

### Onboarding Material Representation

> In order for the users of Matter products to recognize the onboarding material, and be able to use it easily, it is important to keep the representations of the onboarding material unified and of certain minimum size. To support this the [Matter Brand Guidelines](#_bookmark15) specify the characteristics like composi­ tion, colors, font, font size, QR Code size and digit-grouping of the Manual Pairing code.
>
> When the onboarding material is printed on product or packaging material it SHALL follow the [Matter Brand Guidelines](#_bookmark15).
>
> Other representations (product display, app, etc) of the onboarding material SHOULD follow the [Matter Brand Guidelines](#_bookmark15).

### QR Code

> The Onboarding Payload MAY be included on (or with) a device in the form of a QR code. The fol­ lowing sections detail the content, encoding, and formatting of the QR code.

#### Payload

> The content of the QR code consists of the concatenation of a prefix string and a Base-38-encoded string containing the required and optional TLV content:

[TABLE]

> **Prefix String**
>
> The prefix string consists of the three-character string:

[TABLE]

> **Base-38 Content**
>
> The required content of the QR code is composed of a Packed Binary Data Structure containing ele­ ments of the Onboarding Payload as detailed below. The resulting data is Base-38 encoded (with a specific alphabet) to form a string compatible with alphanumeric QR encoding.
>
> **Packed Binary Data Structure**
>
> Individual data elements SHALL be placed into the structure in the order detailed in the table below. Elements being packed are not necessarily byte- or word-aligned. The resulting packed struc­ ture is presented to the encoder as a multi-byte array (see [Encoding](#_bookmark475) section below), which SHALL be padded with '0' bits at the end of the structure to the nearest byte boundary.
>
> The bits of each fixed-size value are placed in the packed binary data structure in order from least significant to most significant. If TLV Data is included, it is appended to the end of the packed binary data.
>
> For example, the first elements in the table below SHALL be packed into the first bytes of the data array as pictured:
>
> *Table 38. Packing of the onboarding payload*

[TABLE]

[TABLE]

> *Table 39. Packed Binary Data Structure for Onboarding Payload*

[TABLE]

> *Table 40. Discovery Capabilities Bitmask*

[TABLE]

[TABLE]

> **TLV Data**
>
> The TLV data is an optional, variable-length payload. The payload is composed of one or more TLV- encoded elements as defined in detail below in the [TLV Content](#tlv-content) section.
>
> **Encoding**
>
> The Packed Binary Data Structure is Base-38 encoded (with a specific alphabet) to produce an alphanumeric string suitable for use as a QR code payload.
>
> **Alphabet**
>
> The Base-38 alphabet to be employed is composed of a subset of the 45 available characters (A-Z0- 9\$%\*+./ :-) in the QR code for alphanumeric encoding as defined by [ISO/IEC 18004:2015](#_bookmark31), with char­ acters \$, %, \*, +, /, \<space\>, and : removed.
>
> *Table 41. Alphabet for Onboard Payload Encoding*

[TABLE]

> **Method**
>
> Base-38 encoding is achieved by employing a simplified strategy where every 3 bytes (24 bits) of binary source data are encoded to 5 characters of the Base-38 alphabet.
>
> Data from the Packed Binary Data Structure are encoded starting with the first byte of the struc­ ture. Three-byte chunks are formed into a 24-bit unsigned integer for encoding as follows:

[TABLE]

> The 24-bit value is subsequently converted to Base-38 radix using the alphabet above to produce a 5-character substring, with the least-significant character appearing first (little-endian).
>
> If a single byte of binary source data remains, it SHALL be converted to Base-38 radix using the alphabet above to produce a 2-character substring, with the least-significant character appearing first.
>
> If two bytes of binary source data remains, they SHALL be formed into a 16-bit unsigned integer for encoding as follows:

[TABLE]

> This 16-bit value is subsequently converted to Base-38 radix using the alphabet above to produce a 4-character substring, with the least-significant character appearing first.
>
> The final encoded string is a result of concatenation of all substrings, with the first-encoded sub­ string appearing at the beginning of the concatenated string.

#### QR Code Format

> The format selection, which includes the QR code Version and ECC levels as well as size and color, MAY be tailored to the requirements of the manufacturer and their respective product, provided it meets the following requirements:
>
> **QR code Version and Encoding**
>
> The QR code generated, as defined in [ISO/IEC 18004:2015](#_bookmark31), SHALL be of Version 1 or higher, using alphanumeric encoding. The size of the payload implies a minimum Version, though a higher Ver­ sion may be needed to allow a higher ECC level. For example, a minimum payload of 22 alphanu­ meric characters (19 base-38-encoded characters from the packed binary structure plus 3 prefix characters) can be fit into a Version 1 with ECC=L, but for ECC=M, Q or H, the same payload requires a Version 2 QR code. This allows the Manufacturer to balance between ECC, pixel size and overall size.
>
> **Example QR Code Sizes and Payloads**

[TABLE]

[TABLE]

#### NOTE

> Version 1 codes with ECC levels M, Q, and H and version 2 codes with ECC level H have insufficient capacity

#### NOTE

> *Total available payload, excluding prefix* = (trunc((N-3) / 5) \* 24) where N is the number of alphanumeric characters which fit in the QR code. This formula uses N-3 to account for the prefix characters, and then determines how many groups of 5 base-38-encoded characters can fit; each such group carrying 24 bits of payload.
>
> This formula fills groups of 5 characters after the MT: prefix. If there are 2,3 or 4
>
> characters left after these groups, an additional 8 bits (for 2,3 characters) or 16 bits (for 4 characters) of TLV data can be accommodated. So the entries in the table take this into account.
>
> *Available payload for TLV data* = (Total available payload, excluding prefix - 88)
>
> since the minimum payload for the Packed Binary Data Structure is 84 bits before padding, or 88 bits with padding.
>
> **Payload Limits**
>
> The number of alphanumeric characters in the QR code SHALL NOT exceed 255 characters. Using this maximum size would yield a total available payload of 1208 bits, and hence 1120 bits of TLV payload.
>
> **ECC Level**
>
> The QR code SHOULD employ level M or higher ECC.

#### NOTE

> A higher level ECC does not help against typical 'reading' issues like shiny surfaces, bad contrast or issues with camera resolution/focus, and lack of camera-app pro­
>
> cessing dedicated for QR codes. Therefore, in certain situations ECC=L MAY be used as well (e.g. to prevent having to move to a higher Version to fit the payload).

### Manual Pairing Code

> This section describes the content and format of the Manual Pairing Code, which can be used in cer­ tain situations next to or instead of the QR code described above.

#### Content

> **Payload**
>
> The payload of the Manual Pairing Code consists of the following required and optional data ele­ ments.
>
> *Table 42. Manual Pairing Code Elements*

[TABLE]

> The Vendor ID and Product ID elements are optional. Including these may provide additional infor­ mation for the setup flow at the expense of a substantially longer Manual Pairing Code.
>
> **Custom Flow for Manual Pairing Code**
>
> The encoding for Manual Pairing Code does not have a dedicated field for Custom Flow, as exists in the [Packed Binary Data Structure](#_bookmark472). Instead, this information is encoded in the following way:

- For [Standard commissioning flow](#standard-commissioning-flow), the variant of Manual Pairing Code *without* Vendor ID and Product ID SHALL be used. A commissioner encountering such Manual Pairing Code SHALL assume it is a "standard flow" device.

- For [User-intent commissioning flow](#user-intent-commissioning-flow) and [Custom Commissioning flow](#custom-commissioning-flow), the variant of Manual Pairing Code *with* Vendor ID and Product ID SHALL be used. For this case, a commissioner SHOULD use Vendor ID and Product ID to lookup the [CommissioningCustomFlow](#commissioningcustomflow) field in the [Distributed Compliance Ledger](#distributed-compliance-ledger) to determine which of these values applies for this Vendor ID and Product ID combination.

> **Encoding**
>
> The required and optional elements, along with a check digit, are encoded into either an 11-digit or 21-digit decimal numeric string, depending on whether the optional Vendor and Product ID infor­ mation is included.
>
> **Method**
>
> Each group of digits in the Pairing Code SHALL be encoded as described in the table below. The left- most digit of the entire string SHALL be represented by *DIGIT\[1\]*. Groups of multiple digits SHALL be encoded such that the most-significant digit appears first (left-most).
>
> *Table 43. Encoding Method without Vendor and Product ID’s (VID_PID_Present == 0)*

[TABLE]

> *Table 44. Encoding Method with Vendor and Product ID’s included (VID_PID_Present == 1)*

[TABLE]

> **Check Digit**
>
> The *CHECK_DIGIT* element is a single decimal digit computed across all of the preceding digits of the Pairing Code using the [Verhoeff](#_bookmark82) algorithm.

#### Copying between applications

> When the Manual Pairing Code is presented in an application within a multi-function device, such as an application on a smartphone, it SHOULD provide a mechanism such as a copy button to allow easy conveyance of the information to other commissioners on the same device.
>
> When a Commissioner is implemented as an application within a multi-function device, such as an application on a smartphone, it SHOULD provide a mechanism such as a paste button to allow easy conveyance of the information from an administrator on the same device.
>
> The receiving application SHALL be robust against characters like dashes and spaces that may be included in the string, such as those added for readability by the user, when passed between the applications. For example, a receiving application seeing the code "1234-567-8910" would need to interpret it as "12345678910".

### TLV Content

> A variable-length [TLV Data](#_bookmark474) section MAY be encoded into the Packed Binary Data Structure. The TLV section MAY consist of manufacturer-specific information elements and/or elements common to Matter, encoded using TLV. All elements SHALL be housed within an anonymous top-level structure container.

#### Manufacturer-specific Elements

> Manufacturer-specific elements SHALL be tagged with context-specific tags that have semantics which are defined by the vendor for use in the products using their Vendor ID, and SHALL use tag numbers 0x80 to 0xFF.
>
> Tag numbers 0x00 to 0x7F are reserved to indicate Matter-common elements.
>
> Manufacturer-specific elements inherit the context of the Vendor ID and Product ID provided in the Packed Binary Data Structure described above. All elements SHALL follow the constraints outlined in [Appendix A, *Tag-length-value (TLV) Encoding Format*](#appendix-a-tag-length-value-tlv-encoding-format).

#### Matter-common Elements

> All elements common to Matter SHALL use tag numbers in the range 0x00 to 0x7F, as defined in the following section.
>
> Vendors are encouraged to use Matter-common elements where applicable.
>
> *Table 45. Matter-common Reserved Tags*

[TABLE]

[TABLE]

- If the PBKDF parameters are to be included in the TLV section, both the PBKDFSalt and PBKDFItera­ tions SHALL be encoded.

### Concatenation

> The Onboarding Payload MAY be concatenated with additional Onboarding Payloads to be placed in a single QR Code:

[TABLE]

> Where \* is used as the delimiter.
>
> Concatenation of multiple Matter Onboarding Payloads allows a single QR code to provide the onboarding payload for a number of devices. Example use case for this concatenation:

- Easy onboarding for multi-device packaging, e.g. for a package of light bulbs containing four separate bulbs. Each bulb will have its own Onboarding Payload code(s) printed on the bulb itself. The Manufacturer MAY include a leaflet in the box with a larger QR code containing the concatenation of the four individual Onboarding Payloads. The user can then scan this com­ bined QR code (one step for the user) which would give the Commissioner the Onboarding Pay­ load for all four bulbs in one operation, and it can proceed to commission the four bulbs.

> All Commissioners SHALL recognize the \* separator from the QR code as indication concatenation is used.
>
> A Commissioner which does not support such concatenated Matter Onboarding Payloads SHOULD indicate to the user the need to commission devices one by one by scanning their individual QR codes.
>
> The Commissioner SHOULD commission the devices in the order as they are provided in the con­ catenated code. (This ordering is particularly relevant in case of combi-packs where one of the devices needs to be commissioned first, e.g. a Thread Router first, then one or more Thread-con­ nected bulbs).
>
> Example of concatenated Onboarding Payloads:

[TABLE]

### Generation of the Passcode

> A device can support either dynamic or static passcodes for purposes of establishing the shared secret for the initial secure channel over which further onboarding steps take place.
>
> All devices SHALL conform to the following rules for passcodes:

- Passcodes SHALL NOT be derived from public information, such as a serial number, manufac­ turer date, MAC address, region of origin, etc.

  - The Passcode generation process SHALL use a cryptographically secure random number gener­ ator.

> If a device generates a dynamic Passcode, then it SHALL conform to the following additional rule:

- Passcodes SHALL be accessible to commissioner only during the commissioning process.

> If a device cannot generate a dynamic Passcode, then the static Passcode SHALL conform to the fol­ lowing additional rules:

- A random passcode with 27 bits of entropy SHALL be generated and used for each individual device. Because of the disallowed numbers, the entropy remaining in the actual setup code will be somewhere between 26 bits and 27 bits but the initial value before rejecting disallowed num­ bers SHALL have 27 bits of entropy.

- The device SHALL be supplied with the [PAKE](#_bookmark176) verifier in its internal storage.

- If the static passcode is also supplied to the device, the static passcode SHALL NOT be accessible during operational mode using any data model attributes or commands.

- If the static passcode is supplied to the device, its storage location SHALL be physically isolated from the location where the [PAKE](#_bookmark176) verifier is stored and SHALL only be accessible through local interfaces and SHALL NOT be accessible to the executing unit handling the [PAKE](#_bookmark176) verifier. For example, a device equipped with a NFC connected tag may contain the QR code containing the static passcode in the NFC connected tag private memory and the NDEF record containing the [NFC tag onboarding payload](#nfc-tag) is only presented to the commissioner during the commissioning window through the NFC interface.

#### Invalid Passcodes

> The following Passcodes SHALL NOT be used for the [PASE](#passcode-authenticated-session-establishment-pase) protocol due to their trivial, insecure nature:

- 00000000

- 11111111

- 22222222

- 33333333

- 44444444

- 55555555

- 66666666

- 77777777

- 88888888

- 99999999

- 12345678

- 87654321

### NFC Tag

> A Commissioner MAY use, in addition to the [QR Code Format](#qr-code-format) and [Manual Pairing Code](#manual-pairing-code) as described above, an NFC tag associated with a Commissionee to retrieve the Onboarding Payload. When an NFC tag is used the following requirements are applicable.

- The data contained in the NFC tag SHALL be the same as specified in [QR Code Format](#qr-code-format).

- The NFC tag SHALL be one of the types as defined by *NFC Forum*.

- The NFC tag SHALL use the NFC Data Exchange Format (NDEF) as defined by [NFC NDEF 1.0](#_bookmark33).

- The NFC tag SHALL use NDEF messages as defined by [NFC RTD 1.0](#_bookmark34).

- The Onboarding Payload for the NFC tag SHALL use NDEF URI Record Type Definition as defined by [NFC RTD URI 1.0](#_bookmark35) and as specified in the following table.

> *Table 46. NFC NDEF Representation*

| **Offset** | **Content** | **Description** |
|----|----|----|
| 0 | 0xD1 | TNF=0x01, SR=1, MB=1, ME=1 |
| 1 | 0x01 | Length of Record Type |
| 2 | URI payload size in bytes | Length of payload |
| 3 | 0x55 | Record Name ("U") |
| 4 | 0x00 | URI Identifier Code: No URI abbreviation |
| 5 | URI data | MT:\<base-38-content\> |

## Initiating Commissioning

### Purpose and Scope

> The process of Matter commissioning can be initiated by the User in a number of ways. This section describes different user journeys supported by Matter. For each, a rationale is provided along with a high-level flow description, up until the point where a commissioning secure session is estab­ lished. References to sections describing dependent functionality in more detail are provided.
>
> The purpose of this section is to connect features provided in other sections to the user journeys for which they are designed.
>
> **WARNING** The list of user journeys provided here is not meant to be exhaustive; there may be other journeys not listed here which can be realized using Matter.
>
> This section provides rationales for Matter functionality and does NOT contain normative require­ ments for Matter.
>
> The following User Journeys are described in this section:

- [Section 5.2.2.1, “Commissioner Setup Code Entry, Not Yet Commissioned Device”](#commissioner-setup-code-entry-not-yet-commissioned-device). "Launch Com­

> missioner, Enter Code"

- [Section 5.2.2.2, “User-Initiated Beacon Detection, Not Yet Commissioned Device”](#user-initiated-beacon-detection-not-yet-commissioned-device). "Launch Com­ missioner, Discover New Devices"

- [Section 5.2.2.3, “User-Initiated Beacon Detection, Already Commissioned Device”](#user-initiated-beacon-detection-already-commissioned-device). "Launch Com­ missioner, Discover My devices"

- [Section 5.2.2.4, “Commissioner Discovery, from an On-Network Device”](#commissioner-discovery-from-an-on-network-device). "Launch Device User Interface, Discover Commissioners"

### User Journey Details

#### Commissioner Setup Code Entry, Not Yet Commissioned Device

> "Launch Commissioner, Enter Code"
>
> In the Setup Code Entry for a Not Yet Commissioned Device use case, the User first initiates an inter­ action with a Commissioner, and then provides the necessary setup code from the Commissionee, by scanning an Onboarding Payload (e.g. QR Code) or otherwise inputting the manual setup code through an input method supported by the commissioner.

1.  **Rationale**

> In this use case, the user will often have the device in-hand, have immediate access to the onboard­ ing payload, and have immediate access to the desired Commissioner.

2.  **High Level Flow**

    1.  User initiates an interaction with a Commissioner.

    2.  User inputs the onboarding payload from the Commissionee.

    3.  Commissioner determines which technologies to use for [Device Discovery](#device-discovery). When attempting to locate the device on IP-bearing networks, the [Commissionable Node Discovery](#commissionable-node-discovery) method is used and typically the DNS-SD service subtypes for long or short discriminator, and commissioning mode (see [Commissioning Subtypes](#commissioning-subtypes)) are specified to filter the results to Commissionees that match the discriminator in the onboarding payload and that are in Commissioning Mode. When attempting to locate the device via BLE advertisements, the discriminator will typically be used to filter the results.

    4.  Commissioner begins the Commissioning process (see [Section 5.5, “Commissioning Flows”](#commissioning-flows)). If more than one Commissionee is discovered, the Commissioner may further refine the results using any additional information such as a Vendor ID or Product ID that may be available in the onboarding payload. If there is still more than one discovered Commissionee, the Commissioner will typically attempt to establish a [PASE](#passcode-authenticated-session-establishment-pase) secure commissioning session with each.

3.  **Misuse Considerations**

> When a device has a static onboarding payload, and the value is physically affixed to the product, it is possible for an attacker with one-time physical access to the device to obtain the onboarding pay­ load and use it to compromise the security of the device in the future. For example, if the device is commissioned again using the same onboarding payload (for example, after a reset), then the
>
> attacker may be able to perform a person-in-the-middle attack which could result in a compromise of sensitive user data such as network credentials if passed to the device.
>
> When a device includes device-specific information such as Vendor ID and Product ID in advertise­ ments, then a malicious actor within advertisement range can detect this information and poten­ tially associate it with the location of the device (and potentially, additional information about the location, such as its residents) in ways that the user did not intend.

#### User-Initiated Beacon Detection, Not Yet Commissioned Device

> "Launch Commissioner, Discover New Devices"
>
> In the User-Initiated Beacon Detection for a Not Yet Commissioned Device use case, the User first initiates an interaction with a Commissioner, and then indicates an intention to commission devices without providing additional information about them (no onboarding payload, etc).

1.  **Rationale**

> In this use case, the user has immediate access to a Commissioner. However, the user may not know how to locate the onboarding payload (it may be hidden behind a panel, pin-protected in a settings menu, or inaccessible on a device already physically installed).
>
> Example User interactions with the Commissioner include pushing a "Discover New Devices" but­ ton, or speaking to a voice agent "Agent, discover new devices".

2.  **High Level Flow**

    1.  User initiates an interaction with a Commissioner.

    2.  User indicates an intention to commission devices without providing additional information about them.

    3.  Commissioner determines which technologies to use for [Device Discovery](#device-discovery). When attempting to locate the device on IP-bearing networks, the [Commissionable Node Discovery](#commissionable-node-discovery) method is used and typically the subtype for commissioning mode (see [Commissioning Subtypes](#commissioning-subtypes)) is specified with value 1 in order to filter the results to Commissionees that are in Commissioning Mode.

    4.  Commissioner constructs a list of Commissionees discovered, using as much information as pos­ sible from the Commissionee advertisement. When a Vendor ID and Product ID is provided in the advertisement, the Commissioner may obtain human readable descriptions of the Vendor and Product in order to assist the user with selection by using fields such as ProductName and ProductLabel from the [Distributed Compliance Ledger](#distributed-compliance-ledger) or any other data set available to it. The ledger entry may also include additional URLs which the Commissioner can offer to the user to help in locating the Setup Code or otherwise assist in setting up the device such as the UserManu­ alUrl, SupportUrl, and ProductUrl. The Commissioner may have additional data sets available for assisting the user.

    5.  User selects Commissionee from list.

    6.  Commissioner instructs the user to locate and input the onboarding payload.

    7.  Commissioner begins the Commissioning process (see [Section 5.5, “Commissioning Flows”](#commissioning-flows)).

3.  **Variation - Filter by Device Type**

> The user may indicate the type of device to the Commissioner when initiating this flow. For exam­ ple, the user might speak the following to a voice agent: "Agent, Discover TVs".
>
> When discovering TVs or any other specific device type on the IP network, this flow will be the same except that a subtype which specifies the device type identifier (see [Descriptor Cluster](#descriptor-cluster) on [root](#root-node-endpoint) [node endpoint](#root-node-endpoint)) is passed to the [Commissionable Node Discovery](#commissionable-node-discovery) method (see [Commissioning Sub­](#commissioning-subtypes) [types](#commissioning-subtypes)).

4.  **Misuse Considerations**

> In addition to the Misuse Considerations for the [Section 5.2.2.2, “User-Initiated Beacon Detection,](#user-initiated-beacon-detection-not-yet-commissioned-device) [Not Yet Commissioned Device”](#user-initiated-beacon-detection-not-yet-commissioned-device), a Commissioner which performs [Device Discovery](#device-discovery) without knowl­ edge of the Onboarding Payload may discover advertisements from devices that the user did not intend to onboard with the given Commissioner. This additional information collected by the Com­ missioner can be associated with the user in ways that the user did not intend.

#### User-Initiated Beacon Detection, Already Commissioned Device

> "Launch Commissioner, Discover My Devices"
>
> In the User-Initiated Beacon Detection for an Already Commissioned Device use case, the User first initiates an interaction with a Commissioner, and then indicates an intention to commission devices already on the IP network without providing additional information about them.

1.  **Rationale**

> A Device may choose to be discoverable by entities on the local IP network, even when not in Com­ missioning Mode, in order to satisfy specific user journeys. For example, a TV, Network Infrastruc­ ture Manager, or Bridge device may choose to be discoverable in order to facilitate connectivity with other Smart Home systems. One way for a device to be discoverable when not in Commission­ ing Mode is to implement [Extended Discovery](#extended-discovery).
>
> Example User interactions with the Commissioner include pushing a "Discover My Devices" button, or speaking to a voice agent "Agent, discover my devices".

2.  **High Level Flow**

    1.  User initiates an interaction with a Commissioner.

    2.  User indicates an intention to commission existing devices on the IP network. This may or may not include additional information about them, such as a device type.

    3.  Commissioner performs [Commissionable Node Discovery](#commissionable-node-discovery) via DNS-SD. The subtype for device type (see [Commissioning Subtypes](#commissioning-subtypes)) can be specified in order to filter the results to Commis­ sionees that have a specific primary function device type.

    4.  Commissioner constructs a list of Commissionees discovered, using as much information as pos­ sible from the Commissionee advertisement. When a Vendor ID and Product ID is provided (see [Commissioning VID/PID](#txt-key-for-vendor-id-and-product-id-vp)), the Commissioner may obtain human readable descriptions of the Vendor and Product in order to assist the user with selection by using fields such as ProductName

> and ProductLabel from the [Distributed Compliance Ledger](#distributed-compliance-ledger) or any other data set available to it. The ledger entry may also include additional URLs which the Commissioner can offer to the user to help in locating the Setup Code or otherwise assist in setting up the device such as the UserManualUrl, SupportUrl, and ProductUrl. The Commissioner may have additional data sets available for assisting the user. When the Device Type (see [Commissioning Device Type](#txt-key-for-device-type-dt)) and/or the Device Name (see [Commissioning Device Name](#txt-key-for-device-name-dn)) values are provided, then the Commis­ sioner may provide this information to the user in order to assist with Commissionee selection.

5.  User selects Commissionee from list.

6.  The [Commissionable Node Discovery](#commissionable-node-discovery) DNS-SD TXT record for the selected Commissionee includes key/value pairs that can help the Commissioner to guide the user through the next steps of the commissioning process.

7.  If the Commissioning Mode value (see [Commissioning Mode](#txt-key-for-commissioning-mode-cm)) is set to 0, then the Commissionee is not yet in Commissioning Mode and the Commissioner can guide the user through the steps needed to put the Commissionee into Commissioning Mode. The Pairing Hint (see: [Commission­](#txt-key-for-pairing-hint-ph) [ing Pairing Hint](#txt-key-for-pairing-hint-ph)) and the Pairing Instruction (see: [Commissioning Pairing Instruction](#txt-key-for-pairing-instructions-pi)) fields would then indicate the steps that can be followed by the user to put the device into Commis­ sioning Mode. When the Pairing Hint is present and its value has bit 1 set (Device Manufacturer URL), then the Commissioner can utilize the URL specified in the [CommissioningCustomFlowUrl](#commissioningcustomflowurl) of the [DeviceModel schema](#devicemodel-schema) entry indexed by the Vendor ID and Product ID in the [Distributed Com­](#distributed-compliance-ledger) [pliance Ledger](#distributed-compliance-ledger) and utilize flows described in [Custom Commissioning Flow](#custom-commissioning-flow) to redirect the user to a custom app or website specified by the device vendor, and receive the user back following the callback flow which contains the onboarding payload. The [Custom Commissioning Flow](#custom-commissioning-flow) can provide a deterministic user experience for putting the device into commissioning mode and transferring the onboarding payload to the Commissioner. The Commissioner then verifies the new Commissioning Mode state using [Commissionable Node Discovery](#commissionable-node-discovery).

8.  Commissioner instructs the user to locate and input the onboarding payload if needed. When a Vendor ID and Product ID is available to the Commissioner, the [Distributed Compliance Ledger](#distributed-compliance-ledger) may also provide a URL for the Device User Guide which can contain additional information to help in locating the onboarding payload. The Commissioner may have additional data sets avail­ able for assisting the user.

9.  Commissioner begins the Commissioning process (see [Section 5.5, “Commissioning Flows”](#commissioning-flows)).

&nbsp;

3.  **Variation - Filter by Device Type**

> A variation on this use case is when a user action causes the Commissioner to ask the user for per­ mission to discover devices or to discover a specific type of device on the network, such as a TV for remote controlling playback or a Home Router Access Point for managing network credentials.
>
> The user may indicate the type of device to the Commissioner when initiating this flow. For exam­ ple, the user might speak the following to a voice agent: "Agent, Discover TVs".
>
> Example User interactions which are tied to discovery of specific device types include:

1.  When a user indicates their desire to use a specific Matter Admin/Commissioner, the Commis­ sioner might attempt to discover devices of type Network Infrastructure Manager on the net­ work, and prompt the user with instructions for connecting to it.

2.  When a user indicates their desire to use a specific Matter Video Remote Control, the Video Remote Control might look for Video Players on the network, and prompt the user with instruc­ tions for connecting to it.

> When discovering TVs or any other specific device type on the IP network, this flow will be the same except that a subtype which specifies the device type identifier is passed to the [Commission­](#commissionable-node-discovery) [able Node Discovery](#commissionable-node-discovery) method (see [Commissioning Subtypes](#commissioning-subtypes)).

4.  **Misuse Considerations**

> When a Device implements [Commissionable Node Discovery](#commissionable-node-discovery) while not in Commissioning Mode, the time period during which it may unintentionally provide information to a malicious actor on the network is longer than it otherwise would be. This additional information could potentially be asso­ ciated with the user in ways that the user did not intend. See [Commissionable Node Discovery Pri­](#_bookmark192) [vacy Considerations](#_bookmark192) for device requirements relating to this risk.
>
> When a device includes device-specific information such as Vendor ID, Product ID and Device Type, or user-generated data such as Device Name, in the DNS-SD TXT record, then a malicious actor on the network can detect this information and potentially associate it with the user in ways that the user did not intend.
>
> A Commissioner which performs [Device Discovery](#device-discovery) without knowledge of the Onboarding Payload may discover devices on the network that the user did not intend to onboard with the given Com­ missioner. This additional information collected by the Commissioner can be associated with the user in ways that the user did not intend.

#### Commissioner Discovery, from an On-Network Device

> "Launch Device User Interface, Discover Commissioners"
>
> In the Commissioner Discovery use case for a Device already on the IP network, the User first initi­ ates an interaction with the Device via a display or other user interface, and indicates the intention to have this device commissioned by a Commissioner on the network. The Device might already have been commissioned into one or many Fabrics or it might not yet have been commissioned. Upon this user interaction, the Device discovers candidate Commissioners and allows the user to select one. The Device then requests from that Commissioner to be commissioned.

1.  **Rationale**

> In this use case, a Device (Commissionee) with a user interface, such as a TV or Thermostat, initiates the commissioning process. For example, this might be done from within a settings menu for Smart Home control. The Device discovers Commissioners on the IP-bearing network, presents the result­ ing list to the User for selection. Once selected, the Device indicates to the selected Commissioner that it has been selected by the User, the Device enters Commissioning Mode and provides the onboarding payload to the User.
>
> Another example for this use case is a Device or Node (Commissionee) with a user interface, such as a Content Provider Device or Application, that initiates the commissioning process. This might be done from a program guide or while watching a video when the user indicates a desire to play the selected content on a nearby device. The Device discovers Commissioners on the IP-bearing net­
>
> work, presents the resulting list to the User for selection. Once selected, the Commissionee indicates to the selected Commissioner that it has been selected by the User (see [User Directed Commission­](#user-directed-commissioning) [ing](#user-directed-commissioning)), the Commissionee enters Commissioning Mode and provides the onboarding payload to the User.

2.  **High Level Flow**

    1.  User initiates an interaction with the Device.

    2.  User indicates a desire to connect this Device with a Commissioner on the network.

    3.  Device uses [Commissioner Discovery](#commissioner-discovery) over DNS-SD on the IP bearing network.

    4.  Device collects candidates from DNS-SD service records found.

    5.  Device displays list of Commissioners discovered, including as much information as possible from the DNS-SD TXT record. When a Vendor ID and Product ID is provided (see [Commissioning](#txt-key-for-vendor-id-and-product-id-vp) [VID/PID](#txt-key-for-vendor-id-and-product-id-vp)), the Device may obtain human readable descriptions of the Vendor and Product in order to assist the user with selection by using fields such as ProductName and ProductLabel from the [Distributed Compliance Ledger](#distributed-compliance-ledger) or any other data set available to it. The Device may have additional data sets available for assisting the user. When the Device Type (see [Commissioning](#txt-key-for-device-type-dt) [Device Type](#txt-key-for-device-type-dt)) and/or the Device Name (see [Commissioning Device Name](#txt-key-for-device-name-dn)) values are provided in the DNS-SD TXT record, then the Device may provide this information to the user in order to assist with Commissioner selection.

    6.  User selects an entry from the list.

    7.  Device enters Commissioning Mode.

    8.  Device displays onboarding payload to the user.

    9.  Device initiates a [User Directed Commissioning](#user-directed-commissioning) session with the selected Commissioner, which includes in the DNS-SD service name of the Device.

    10. Commissioner prompts user to confirm intention to commission this device and asks for onboarding payload.

    11. User enters onboarding payload into Commissioner UX.

    12. Commissioner begins the commissioning process (see [Section 5.5, “Commissioning Flows”](#commissioning-flows)).

> For additional variations relating to the display and input of the onboarding payload, see [User](#user-directed-commissioning) [Directed Commissioning](#user-directed-commissioning).

3.  **Misuse Considerations**

> In addition to the Misuse Considerations for the [Section 5.2.2.3, “User-Initiated Beacon Detection,](#user-initiated-beacon-detection-already-commissioned-device) [Already Commissioned Device”](#user-initiated-beacon-detection-already-commissioned-device), a Commissionee which performs [Commissioner Discovery](#commissioner-discovery) may dis­ cover Commissioners on the network that the user did not intend to be discovered by the given Commissionee. This additional information collected by the Commissionee can be associated with the user in ways that the user did not intend. See [Commissioner Discovery Privacy Considerations](#_bookmark210) for Commissioner requirements relating to this risk.
>
> Since there are no trust mechanisms employed for Commissioners advertising themselves, Commis­ sionees may provide Commissioner selection choices to the User that are from malicious entities masquerading as commissioners.
>
> When a Commissioner includes device-specific information such as Vendor ID, Product ID and Device Type, or user-generated data such as Device Name, in the DNS-SD TXT record, then a mali­ cious actor on the network can detect this information and potentially associate it with the user in ways that the user did not intend.

## User Directed Commissioning

### Overview

> In User Directed Commissioning (UDC), the Commissionee sends a message to the Commissioner in order to initiate the commissioning process (see [Section 5.5, “Commissioning Flows”](#commissioning-flows)). In addition, the Commissionee can specify its UX preferences for the commissioning session using optional parameters in the message. Similarly, the Commissioner can send a message to the Commissionee to indicate its pre-commissioning state in order to help the Commissionee simplify the experience for the user.
>
> The availability of the UDC protocol is advertised through Commissioner Discovery service records of DNS-SD service type \_matterd.\_udp (see [Section 4.3.3, “Commissioner Discovery”](#commissioner-discovery)).
>
> Overall, the UDC protocol is a lightweight "door bell" message sent by a Commissionee. There is no state or session associated with UDC protocol messages, allowing the recipient to choose to support messages received from different sources at the same time, or choose to ignore messages received while the processing of an earlier message has not completed. The UDC protocol consists of an Iden­ tification Declaration which provides the Commissionee’s \_matterc.\_udp DNS‑SD service instance name. In addition, Identification Declaration MAY include optional information relating to the requested commissioning session.
>
> Upon receiving this message, the Commissioner MAY query the DNS-SD service instance indicated in the Identification Declaration, including TXT records, in order to obtain additional information about the Commissionee, MAY obtain the corresponding Onboarding Payload or Passcode from the user for this Commissionee, and MAY initiate the commissioning process with it.
>
> The Commissioner MAY send a CommissionerDeclaration to the Identification Declaration message sender’s source IP and Port. The CommissionerDeclaration provides information to a Commissionee indicating the Commissioner’s pre-commissioning state, which MAY be used by the Commissionee to simplify the Passcode entry user experience.
>
> Upon receiving this message, the Commissionee MAY provide instructions to the user about how to proceed to the next steps in the commissioning process, for example, by displaying a Passcode to the user, and instructing them to provide it to the Commissioner.
>
> While a sequence of these messages between Commissionee and Commissioner can be used to achieve a specific user experience, as the examples below illustrate, the processing of each message is expected to stand alone and not be dependent upon other messages in the sequence. For this rea­ son there is no use of session or exchange identifiers, and no encryption of the messages. Conse­ quently, there are no guarantees of behavior or acknowledgements, information contained in mes­ sages SHOULD be assumed to be visible to the network, and messages SHALL NOT contain private or sensitive information.
>
> The Commissionee and Commissioner SHALL enforce rate limiting of these messages and provide the option for the user to disable handling of them (either temporarily or until manually re- enabled). For example, a rate limiting algorithm of accepting no more than 20 messages (not includ­ ing retries) in a 10 minute period is recommended.
>
> One possible user journey for this feature is described in [Commissioner Discovery from an Existing](#commissioner-discovery-from-an-on-network-device) [Device](#commissioner-discovery-from-an-on-network-device).

> *Figure 31. Overview of the UDC Protocol Commissioner Declaration message*
>
> The Commissioner is the Initiator and the Commissionee is the Recipient of the CommissionerDec­ laration message.
>
> It is assumed that the user has directed the Initiator to send the IdentificationDeclaration message to the Recipient. Upon receipt and before starting a PASE session with the Initiator, it is assumed that the Recipient will obtain DNS-SD record information (including TXT records) for the Initiator, which was either provided in the IdentificationDeclaration message or can be obtained by querying the DNS-SD records, and then prompt the user for approval and to enter its Onboarding Payload or Passcode.

### UDC Protocol Messages

> *Table 47. User Directed Commissioning Protocol*

[TABLE]

[TABLE]

### Message format

> All UDC messages SHALL be structured as specified in [Section 4.4, “Message Frame Format”](#message-frame-format). All UDC messages are unsecured at the message layer:

- The [Session ID](#session-id-16-bits) field SHALL be set to 0.

- The [Session Type](#_bookmark230) bits of the [Security Flags](#security-flags-8-bits) SHALL be set to 0.

- The [S Flag](#_bookmark223) and [DSIZ](#_bookmark224) fields of the [Message Flags](#message-flags-8-bits) SHALL be set to 0.

> The [R Flag](#_bookmark242) of the [Exchange Flags](#exchange-flags-8-bits) for the UDC messages SHALL be set to 0.
>
> For each UDC message, the [application payload](#message-frame-format) is the TLV encoding of the message structure as defined below:
>
> *Table 48. UDC Messages*

| **Message Name** | **Payload TLV Encoding** |
|----|----|
| IdentificationDeclaration | [IdentificationDeclaration-struct](#_bookmark500) |
| CommissionerDeclaration | [CommissionerDeclaration-struct](#_bookmark503) |

> The other fields of the [Message format](#message-frame-format) are not specific to the UDC messages.

### Message Exchanges

> The flags of the [Exchange Flags](#exchange-flags-8-bits) of the [Protocol Header](#protocol-header-field-descriptions) are defined as follows per UDC message:

| **Message**               | **I Flag** |
|---------------------------|------------|
| IdentificationDeclaration | 1          |
| CommissionerDeclaration   | 1          |

> All UDC IdentificationDeclaration messages SHALL be sent without acknowledgement (e.g., unreli­ ably) using UDP, to an IP address found in a A or AAAA record associated with the Commissioner Discovery (\_matterd.\_udp) service, using UDP with a destination port as found in the \_matterd.\_udp SRV record.
>
> All UDC CommissionerDeclaration messages SHALL be sent without acknowledgement (e.g., unreli­ ably) using UDP, to the source IP address of the sender of IdentificationDeclaration message, and the port specified in the IdentificationDeclaration message payload.
>
> The Initiator MAY send up to 4 retries. Each retransmission SHALL be delayed by at least 100 ms from the previous transmission.
>
> The other fields of the [Protocol Header](#protocol-header-field-descriptions) are not specific to the UDC messages.

### IdentificationDeclaration Message

> This message serves to identify the Commissionee. It can also specify information relating to the requested commissioning session, such as whether to display a Passcode entry dialog. It is sent by the Commissionee to the Commissioner.
>
> In addition to a mandatory instanceName field, which can be used by the Commissioner to perform [Commissionable Node Discovery](#commissionable-node-discovery) in order to determine the service IP and Port used to establish a PASE session with the Commissionee, there are a number of optional fields in the IdentificationDec­ laration which can be used by the Commissionee to improve performance and usability of the user experience.
>
> The payload for the IdentificationDeclaration message begins with 17 bytes which consist of the DNS-SD instance name defined in [Commissionable Node Discovery](#commissionable-node-discovery) encoded as 16 characters of ascii text, followed by a null termination character.
>
> Following the 17 bytes is the encoded IdentificationDeclaration-struct TLV.

[TABLE]

[TABLE]

#### Features

1.  **Bypass Commissionable Node Discovery**

> In practice, the Commissionable Node Discovery step performed by the Commissioner in response to receiving an IdentificationDeclaration can incur 1 second or more of latency. A Commissionee can provide the same information that a Commissioner would obtain through Commissionable Node Discovery by providing this data in the IdentificationDeclaration message.
>
> The Commissioner MAY bypass the Commissionable Node Discovery step of the [Commissioner Dis­](#commissioner-discovery-from-an-on-network-device) [covery from an Existing Device](#commissioner-discovery-from-an-on-network-device) process when it receives the information it needs in the Identifica­ tionDeclaration message, namely, the Port field. The Commissionee MAY also include VendorId, Pro­ ductId, DeviceName, DeviceType, PairingInstruction, PairingHint, and RotatingDeviceId fields in the IdentificationDeclaration message, similar to the existence of these fields in the DNS-SD Commis­ sionable Node Discovery response.
>
> See [UDC With Commissionable Node Discovery Bypass](#udc-with-commissionable-node-discovery-bypass).

2.  **Target Content Application**

> In some cases, the Commissionee prefers to determine in advance of commissioning if their Content Application is present on the Commissioner (see Device Library, section 10 *Media Device Types*). This allows the Commissionee to warn the user when an experience with reduced functionality will result from commissioning, and may cause the Commissionee or the user to choose not to proceed with the user-directed-commissioning flow.
>
> Some Commissionees will choose not to proceed with the user-directed-commissioning flow if their app is not present for cases where the user experience requires their app, such as when a casting video client app is designed for communication with a specific content app on a casting video player.
>
> The NoPasscode field allows the Commissionee to determine if their app is present but has a differ­ ent account active in it. Some Commissionees do not support guest mode, or multiple simultaneous accounts in their app. In this scenario, the Commissionee might ask the user to switch accounts on the Commissioner in order to proceed.
>
> When the Commissionee provides the VidList, the Commissioner SHALL apply this list as a further restriction upon the set of Content Application Vendor IDs that can be used for authentication (see AccountLogin cluster).
>
> See [UDC With Targeted App Selection](#udc-with-no-passcode-prompt-targeted-app-selection).

3.  **Coordinate Passcode Dialogs**

> In some cases, the Passcode needed for commissioning is obtained from a Content App running on the Commissioner by way of the AccountLogin cluster. When the Passcode is obtained in this fash­
>
> ion, no Passcode display on the Commissionee is required, and displaying a Passcode can be confus­ ing for the user.
>
> To address this, the Commissionee can request to be told by the Commissioner when it is requesting a Passcode from the user (so that the Commissionee can display the Passcode) by using the CdUpon­ PasscodeDialog field in the IdentificationDeclaration message. The Commissioner would then send a CommissionerDeclaration message to indicate that a Passcode is needed.
>
> The Commissionee can also inform the Commissioner that the user has declined or exited the com­ missioning process by using the CancelPasscode field in the IdentificationDeclaration message.
>
> See [UDC With Coordinated Passcode](#udc-with-coordinated-passcode-prompt).

4.  **Commissioner-Generated Passcode**

> In some scenarios, it is simpler for the user to enter a Passcode into the Commissionee UX than it is to enter a Passcode into a Commissioner UX. For example, when the Commissionee is a mobile phone app and the Commissioner is a TV, it can be easier to enter a Passcode on a mobile phone than a TV remote control (which might not have number buttons).
>
> In this scenario, the Commissioner generates a Passcode and displays it for the user. The user enters the Passcode into the Commissionee UX. The Commissionee UX generates a PASE verifier based upon this Passcode and enters commissioning mode using this PASE verifier. The Commis­ sionee then notifies the Commissioner that it is in commissioning mode (using the new PASE veri­ fier) by sending a IdentificationDeclaration with the CommissionerPasscodeReady field set to true.
>
> If, in addition to dynamic passcodes, the Commissioner provides a fixed passcode option, it SHALL be user-updatable and the Commissioner SHALL provide an option to the user to reset the fixed passcode frequently, and SHALL provide an option to disable the fixed passcode feature.
>
> A Commissioner indicates that it supports this feature via the CP txt record in [Commissionable Node](#commissionable-node-discovery) [Discovery](#commissionable-node-discovery).
>
> A Commissionee can utilize this feature via the CommissionerPasscode and CommissionerPasscodeReady
>
> fields.
>
> The Commissionee can also inform the Commissioner that the user has declined or exited the com­ missioning process by using the CancelPasscode field in the IdentificationDeclaration message.
>
> See [UDC With Commissioner Passcode](#udc-with-commissioner-generated-passcode).

| NoPasscode | Target Content Application | Flag to instruct the Commissioner not to display a Passcode input dialog, and instead send a CommissionerDeclaration message if a commissioning Passcode is needed. |

| **Parameter Name** | **Feature** | **Description** |
|----|----|----|
| CdUponPass­ codeDialog | Coordinate Passcode Dialogs | Flag to instruct the Commissioner to send a CommissionerDeclaration message when the Passcode input dialog on the Commis­ sioner has been shown to the user. |
| Commissioner­ Passcode | Commissioner-Generated Passcode | Flag to instruct the Commissioner to use the Commissioner-generated Passcode for commissioning. |
| Commissioner­ PasscodeReady | Commissioner-Generated Passcode | Flag to indicate whether or not the Com­ missionee has obtained the Commissioner Passcode from the user and is therefore ready for commissioning. |
| CancelPass­ code | Coordinate Passcode Dialogs | Flag to indicate when the Commissionee user has decided to exit the commissioning process. |

> To send a IdentificationDeclaration message, the Commissionee SHALL:

1.  Construct the instanceName based upon the DNS-SD instance name defined in [Commissionable](#commissionable-node-discovery) [Node Discovery](#commissionable-node-discovery).

2.  To optionally allow the Commissioner to bypass the Commissionable Node Discovery request:

    1.  Construct the Port from the service port for PASE as found in the SRV record of the DNS-SD [Commissionable Node Discovery](#commissionable-node-discovery) response.

    2.  Optionally, construct the VendorId value as described as input to the [TXT key for Vendor ID](#txt-key-for-vendor-id-and-product-id-vp) [and Product ID](#txt-key-for-vendor-id-and-product-id-vp).

    3.  Optionally, construct the ProductId value as described as input to the [TXT key for Vendor ID](#txt-key-for-vendor-id-and-product-id-vp) [and Product ID](#txt-key-for-vendor-id-and-product-id-vp).

    4.  Optionally, construct the DeviceName value as described in [TXT key for device name](#txt-key-for-device-name-dn).

    5.  Optionally, construct the DeviceType value as described in [TXT key for device type](#txt-key-for-device-type-dt).

    6.  Optionally, construct the PairingInstruction value as described in [TXT key for pairing](#txt-key-for-pairing-instructions-pi) [instruction](#txt-key-for-pairing-instructions-pi).

    7.  Optionally, construct the PairingHint value as described in [TXT key for pairing hint](#txt-key-for-pairing-hint-ph).

    8.  Optionally, construct the RotatingDeviceId value as described in [TXT key for rotating device](#txt-key-for-rotating-device-identifier-ri) [identifier](#txt-key-for-rotating-device-identifier-ri).

3.  Optionally, construct the TargetAppList based upon the set of content app vid/pids that can be used for authentication. This is a subset of vid/pid selected by the Commissioner based upon the vid/pid of the client.

4.  To optionally prevent the Commissioner from automatically showing a Passcode dialog:

    1.  Construct NoPasscode and set to true to indicate that this message SHOULD only trigger a commissioning session if it can be done without asking the user to input a Passcode (eg. the Passcode was provided by external means). When this field is set to true in the Identifica­

> tionDeclaration message, the Commissioner SHALL NOT show a Passcode dialog to the user. Instead, the Commissioner SHOULD send a CommissionerDeclaration message with the NeedsPasscodeDialog field set to true (and potentially NoAppsFound to indicate the reason). The Commissionee can then choose whether to prompt a Passcode dialog (by re-sending the IdentificationDeclaration message without this field) or to abandon this commissioning attempt.

5.  To optionally request that the Commissioner send a CommissionerDeclaration message to serve as an indication that the Commissioner has presented a Passcode dialog to the user:

    1.  Construct the CdUponPasscodeDialog and set to true. When this field is set to true in the Identi­ ficationDeclaration message, the Commissioner SHOULD send a CommissionerDeclaration message with the PasscodeDialogDisplayed set to true upon showing the Passcode input dia­ log to the user. This field SHALL NOT be set when the CommissionerPasscode field is set since these two functionalities are mutually exclusive.

6.  To optionally request a Commissioner-generated Passcode from a Commissioner which indi­ cates support for this feature via the [CP TXT record](#_bookmark211) in [Commissionable Node Discovery](#commissionable-node-discovery):

    1.  Construct the CommissionerPasscode and set to true. When this field is set to true in the Identi­ ficationDeclaration message, the Commissioner SHOULD display the commissioning Pass­ code to the user, and wait to initiate commissioning until an IdentificationDeclaration mes­ sage is received with the CommissionerPasscodeReady field set to true.

    2.  Construct the CommissionerPasscodeReady and set to true to indicate the Commissionee has obtained the Commissioner Passcode from the user and is ready for commissioning, or false to indicate that the user has not entered the Passcode yet, and therefore, the Commissioner SHOULD NOT commence commissioning.

7.  To optionally indicate that the Commissionee user has cancelled the commissioning process:

    1.  Construct the CancelPasscode and set to true. This indicates that the Commissioner can dis­ miss any dialogs corresponding to commissioning, such as a Passcode input dialog or a Pass­ code display dialog.

8.  Construct and send IdentificationDeclaration.

### CommissionerDeclaration Message

> To send a CommissionerDeclaration message, the Commissioner SHALL:

1.  Construct the ErrorCode field if an error condition has been encountered during commissioning by the Commissioner.

2.  When the IdentificationDeclaration message includes the NoPasscode field set to true, and the Commissioner determines that a Passcode code will be needed for commissioning:

    1.  Construct the NeedsPasscode and set to true.

3.  Optionally, construct the NoAppsFound and set to true to indicate that no apps with AccountLogin cluster implementation were found for the last IdentificationDeclaration request. Only apps which provide access to the vendor id of the Commissionee will be considered.

4.  When the IdentificationDeclaration message includes the CdcForPasscode field set to true:

    1.  Construct the PasscodeDialogDisplayed and set to true to indicates that a Passcode input dia­ log is now displayed for the user on the Commissioner. Upon receipt, the Commissionee SHOULD display its Passcode to the user. This field SHALL NOT be set when the Commission­ erPasscode field is set because these fields are mutually exclusive.

5.  When the IdentificationDeclaration message includes the CommissionerPasscode field set to true:

    1.  Construct the CommissionerPasscode and set to true to indicates that a Passcode is now dis­ played for the user by the Commissioner. Upon receipt, the Commissionee SHOULD ask the user to input this Passcode into the Commissionee, the Commissionee SHOULD then update its PAKE Verifier so that it uses this Passcode, and then SHOULD send an IdentificationDecla­ ration message with the CommissionerPasscodeReady field set to true.

    2.  Optionally, construct QRCodeDisplayed and set to true to indicates that the Passcode displayed on the Commissioner includes a QR code option. Clients have the option of letting the user scan via the phone camera.

6.  Construct and send CommissionerDeclaration.

### Example Message Exchanges

#### Regular UDC

> For reference.

1.  UDC with IdentificationDeclaration sent to Commissioner

2.  Commissioner reads instanceName, performs Commissionable Node Discovery to determine vid, pid, rotating ID, Device name, PASE IP, PASE Port

3.  Commissioner prompts user for permission to commission Device name

4.  User approves

5.  Commissioner checks for apps granting access to the vid of the Commissionee, applies a filter on this list if the VidList in the IdentificationDeclaration is populated, and attempts to use Account Login on any resulting apps in order to obtain Passcode using rotatingID

6.  If no Passcode is obtained, Commissioner prompts user to input Passcode from Commissionee

7.  Commissioner attempts to commission Commissionee

#### UDC with Commissionable Node Discovery bypass

> This saves about 1 second of latency in practice due to skipping second step (Commissionable Node Discovery) in Regular UDC.

1.  UDC with IdentificationDeclaration containing VendorId, ProductId, RotatingDeviceId and Port sent to Commissioner

2.  Commissioner prompts user for permission to commission Device name

3.  User approves

4.  Commissioner checks for apps granting access to the vid of the Commissionee, applies a filter on this list if the VidList in the IdentificationDeclaration is populated, and attempts to use Account Login on any resulting apps in order to obtain Passcode using rotatingID

5.  If no Passcode is obtained, Commissioner prompts user to input Passcode from Commissionee

6.  Commissioner attempts to commission Commissionee

#### UDC with coordinated Passcode prompt

> This allows the Commissionee to wait to display the Passcode until it receives a signal from the Commissioner that a Passcode is needed. When the same user account is active on both the Com­ missionee (often, in a phone app) and the Commissioner (often, in a TV app), then the commission­ ing process can often complete without requiring the Commissionee to display a Passcode. When no Passcode is required, it can be confusing for the user if the Commissionee shows a Passcode. To address this, the Commissionee can request to be told by the Commissioner when it’s Passcode input dialog is displayed to the user by sending the IdentificationDeclaration message with the CdUponPasscodeDialog set to true. Then, when a Passcode is needed, the Commissioner sends a CommissionerDeclaration with the NeedsPasscode set to true.

1.  **UDC with coordinated Passcode prompt, no Passcode needed**

    1.  UDC with IdentificationDeclaration sent to Commissioner containing CdUponPasscodeDialog set to true

    5.  Commissioner checks for apps granting access to the vid of the Commissionee, applies a filter on this list if the VidList in the IdentificationDeclaration is populated, and attempts to use Account Login on any resulting apps in order to obtain Passcode using rotatingID

    6.  Passcode is obtained, no need for Commissioner to prompt user to input Passcode from Com­ missionee

    7.  Commissioner attempts to commission Commissionee

2.  **UDC with coordinated Passcode prompt, Passcode is needed**

    1.  UDC with IdentificationDeclaration sent to Commissioner containing CdUponPasscodeDialog set to true

    2.  If Port not provided, then Commissioner reads instanceName, performs Commissionable Node Discovery to determine vid, pid, rotating ID, Device name, PASE IP, PASE Port

    3.  Commissioner prompts user for permission to commission Device name

    4.  User approves

    5.  Commissioner checks for apps granting access to the vid of the Commissionee, applies a filter on this list if the VidList in the IdentificationDeclaration is populated, and attempts to use Account Login on any resulting apps in order to obtain Passcode using rotatingID

    6.  No Passcode is obtained, Commissioner prompts user to input Passcode from Commissionee

    7.  Commissioner sends CommissionerDeclaration with the PasscodeDialogDisplayed set to true

    8.  Commissionee displays Passcode code for user

    9.  User enters Passcode code into Commissioner

    10. Commissioner attempts to commission Commissionee

#### UDC with no Passcode prompt (targeted app selection)

> This allows the Commissionee to determine if their app is present on the Commissioner. Some Com­ missionees will choose not to proceed with commissioning if their app is not present for cases where the user experience requires their app.
>
> This also allows the Commissionee to determine if their app is present but has a different account active in it. Some Commissionees do not support guest mode, or multiple simultaneous accounts in their app. In this scenario, the Commissionee might ask the user to switch accounts on the Commis­ sioner in order to proceed.

1.  **UDC with no app present**

    1.  UDC with IdentificationDeclaration sent to Commissioner containing NoPasscode set to true

    2.  If Port not provided, then Commissioner reads instanceName, performs Commissionable Node Discovery to determine vid, pid, rotating ID, Device name, PASE IP, PASE Port

    3.  Commissioner prompts user for permission to commission Device name

    4.  User approves

    5.  Commissioner checks for apps granting access to the vid of the Commissionee, applies a filter on this list if the VidList in the IdentificationDeclaration is populated, and attempts to use Account Login on any resulting apps in order to obtain Passcode using rotatingID

    6.  No app is found

    7.  Commissioner sends CommissionerDeclaration with the NeedsPasscode field set to true

    8.  Commissionee informs user that its app has a different active account. Provides additional instructions as needed.

#### UDC with Commissioner-generated Passcode

> This allows the Commissionee to utilize a Passcode code generated and displayed on the Commis­ sioner, and input by the user into the Commissionee, rather than the Regular UDC flow where the Passcode code is generated and displayed on the Commissionee, and input by the user into the Com­ missioner. This flow can simplify the user experience when the Commissionee is a mobile phone app and the Commissioner is a TV since it can be easier to enter a Passcode on a mobile phone than a TV.

1.  Commissionee performs Commissioner Discovery, prompts user to select a Commissioner.

2.  Selected Commissioner indicates support for [Commissioner Passcode feature](#_bookmark211) (CP=1) in its DNS- SD TXT record.

## Device Discovery

### Purpose and Scope

> The purpose of this section is to describe the process by which a device is discovered in order to commission it onto an operational Fabric.
>
> Depending on the networking technologies supported by a device, discovery and commissioning are possible using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Wi-Fi ([IEEE 802.11-2020](#_bookmark29)) technologies, or over IP if a device is already on an IP network.
>
> Devices that utilize Thread networking technology SHALL support BLE for the purpose of discovery and commissioning. Thread network commissioning procedures as defined in [Thread](#_bookmark81) are not used to perform Matter discovery and commissioning.
>
> BLE commissioning utilizes the Generic Access Profile (GAP) for discovery and for connection establishment, and the Generic Attribute Profile (GATT) for credential conveyance.
>
> Wi-Fi Public Action Frame commissioning utilizes Wi-Fi Alliance Unsynchronized Service Discovery ([WFA-USD](#_bookmark83)) for discovery, peer-to-peer communication, and credential conveyance.
>
> [WFA-USD](#_bookmark83) is a mechanism for link layer discovery and direct communication between the Commis­ sioner and the device without an 802.11 association between them. It uses the publish and sub­ scribe public action frames for discovery between the Commissioner and the device. After discov­ ery, the Commissioner and the device use follow-up public action frames for credential conveyance and commissioning messages exchange. The publish, subscribe, and follow-up public action frames
>
> are defined by the Wi-Fi Alliance. Devices that support commissioning over Wi-Fi Public Action Frame SHALL support such commissioning on all Wi-Fi bands they support.

#### NOTE

> Since support for commissioning via Wi-Fi Public Action Frame is a new feature, it might not be supported by the user’s choice of Commissioner. Therefore, devices whose only Matter-defined commissioning method uses Wi-Fi Public Action Frame, and which are being certified in the first 2 years following the release of the Matter
>
> 1.4 Specification, SHALL support the [Commissioning Fallback Mechanism](#commissioning-fallback-mechanism).
>
> If a device already has IP-bearing network connectivity (over Wi-Fi, Ethernet, or otherwise), a Com­ missioner SHALL discover such a device using DNS-based Service Discovery (DNS-SD), conveying credentials to the device over IP.

### Announcement by Device

> This section describes how devices announce their commissionable status to allow a Commissioner to discover the device to be commissioned.

#### Announcement and Discovery Using Multiple Technologies

> A device SHALL announce on all of the networking technologies it supports as indicated in the Dis­ covery Capability Bitmask (see [Table 40, “Discovery Capabilities Bitmask”](#_bookmark473)). A Commissioner that is aware of the device’s Discovery Capability Bitmask SHALL initiate Device Discovery on all of the networking technologies that are supported by both the Commissioner and the device. A Commis­ sioner that is unaware of the device’s Discovery Capability Bitmask SHALL initiate Device Discov­ ery on all of the networking technologies it supports out of Wi-Fi Public Action Frame, BLE, and on IP network discovery.
>
> Commissioners SHALL always support discovering a device using DNS-based Service Discovery (DNS-SD) for commissioning, irrespective of the [Discovery Capabilities Bitmask](#_bookmark473) specified in the [Sec­](#onboarding-payload-contents) [tion 5.1.1, “Onboarding Payload Contents”](#onboarding-payload-contents).

#### Announcement Commencement

> A device which is not yet commissioned into a Matter fabric SHALL commence announcing its abil­ ity to be commissioned depending on its primary device function and manufacturer-chosen [Device](#device-commissioning-flows) [Commissioning Flow](#device-commissioning-flows), per the following table. Nodes already commissioned into one or more Matter fabrics or already connected to an IP-bearing network that wish to announce SHALL ONLY do so using DNS-SD over their operational network (see [Section 5.4.2.7, “Using Existing IP-bearing Net­](#using-existing-ip-bearing-network) [work”](#using-existing-ip-bearing-network) and [Section 4.3, “Discovery”](#discovery)). In the interest of privacy, an already-commissioned Node SHALL NOT commence announcement using Bluetooth LE or Wi-Fi Public Action Frame.

| **Primary Device Function** | **Announcement** |
|----|----|
| Most control originates from a Fabric (excluding Locks and Barrier Access Devices) | SHALL start announcing automatically upon application of power when using [Standard commissioning flow](#standard-commissioning-flow). When using [User-intent commissioning flow](#user-intent-commissioning-flow) or [Custom Commis­](#custom-commissioning-flow) [sioning flow](#custom-commissioning-flow), it SHALL NOT start announcing automati­ cally upon application of power. |

| **Primary Device Function** | **Announcement** |
|:---|----|
| Most control does not originate from a Fabric (*e.g.*, dishwasher, coffee maker, refrigerator) | SHALL NOT start announcing automatically upon applica­ tion of power. [User-intent commissioning flow](#user-intent-commissioning-flow) or [Custom](#custom-commissioning-flow) [Commissioning flow](#custom-commissioning-flow) is required. |
| Locks and Barrier Access Devices | SHALL NOT start announcing automatically upon applica­ tion of power. [User-intent commissioning flow](#user-intent-commissioning-flow) or [Custom](#custom-commissioning-flow) [Commissioning flow](#custom-commissioning-flow) is required. |

> Note that the above guidelines are in place to avoid unnecessary pollution of the 2.4 GHz spectrum and as a mitigation of the privacy threat created due to unnecessary transmissions by a commis­ sionable device.
>
> If announcement has ceased (see [Section 5.4.2.3, “Announcement Duration”](#announcement-duration)), it may be re-initiated via a device-specific user interaction such as a button press or other action defined by the manufac­ turer and indicated by the methods specified in [Section 5.7, “Device Commissioning Flows”](#device-commissioning-flows).

#### Announcement Duration

> In order to minimize unnecessary pollution of the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz shared wireless spectrum, especially with device discovery, a commissionable device SHALL NOT announce with a rapid inter­ val for a duration longer than 15 minutes after announcement commences. This duration was cho­ sen to capture the primary case of a user setting up immediately after powering on for a range of devices, including time to download, install and launch applications, transit rooms within a home, etc.
>
> Note that devices MAY choose to announce for less time in order to conserve battery life or for other device-specific reasons. Note that an announcement duration that is too short may result in a poor setup experience for users. Shorter announcement intervals SHOULD only be employed to meet otherwise unattainable device functionality/requirements. To help strike a balance between a good setup experience and conserving battery life, a device SHALL NOT announce for a duration of less than 3 minutes after announcement commences.
>
> A failed attempt to commission does not restart or delay the timeout. Moreover, this timeout applies only to cessation of announcements and not to abortion of connections, *i.e.*, a connection SHOULD NOT abort prematurely upon expiration of the announcement duration.
>
> **5.4.2.3.1. Extended Announcement**
>
> An uncommissioned device MAY announce for a longer period, up to 48 hours in total, known as Extended Announcement. This enhances setup success likelihood for cases where a user needs more than 15 minutes after first powering an uncommissioned device (e.g. physical setup takes \>15 minutes, user must leave and return later).
>
> If a device opts to use Extended Announcement, it SHALL set both the PID and VID to 0 in the announcement and SHALL elide any Extended Data. This is to preserve user privacy for scenarios where a device may remain uncommissioned for extended periods.

#### Discovery Information

> This section details the information advertised by a commissionable Node.

[TABLE]

1.  **Discriminator**

> A 12-bit value matching the field of the same name in the Setup Code.

2.  **Vendor ID**

> A 16-bit value identifying the device manufacturer (see [Section 2.5.2, “Vendor Identifier (Vendor ID,](#vendor-identifier-vendor-id-vid) [VID)”](#vendor-identifier-vendor-id-vid)).

3.  **Product ID**

> A 16-bit value identifying the product (see [Product ID](#product-identifier-product-id-pid)).

4.  **Extended Data**

> Extended Data MAY be made available by commissionable Nodes. This data SHALL be encoded using a standard TLV encoding defined in this section. The location of this data varies based on the Node’s commissioning networking technology.
>
> This extended data SHALL be encoded as a [TLV structure](#structures) tagged with an anonymous tag.
>
> The members of this structure SHALL use [context-specific tags](#context-specific-tag-form) with the values and meanings shown in the table below.

[TABLE]

5.  **Rotating Device Identifier**

> Some device makers need a way to uniquely identify a device before it has been commissioned for vendor-specific customer support purposes. For example, the device maker may need this to iden­ tify factory software version and related features, manufacturing date, or to assist in recovery when a setup code has been lost or damaged. In order to avoid privacy issues associated with exposing a fixed unique identifier, devices MAY utilize a Rotating Device Identifier for identifica­ tion purposes. A Rotating Device Identifier is similar to a serial number but rotates at pre-defined moments.
>
> The Rotating Device Identifier provides a non-trackable identifier which is unique per-device and that can be used in one or more of the following ways:

- Provided to the vendor’s customer support for help in pairing or establishing Node provenance;

- Used programmatically to obtain a Node’s [Passcode](#passcode) or other information in order to provide a simplified setup flow. Note that the mechanism(s) by which the [Passcode](#passcode) may be obtained is outside of this specification. If the Rotating Device Identifier is to be used for this purpose, the system implementing this feature SHALL require proof of possession by the user at least once before providing the [Passcode](#passcode). The mechanism for this proof of possession, and validation of it, is outside of this specification.

> The Rotating Device Identifier is an optional feature for a Node to implement and an optional fea­ ture for a Commissioner to utilize. The algorithm used for generating a Rotating Device Identifier SHALL meet the following security and privacy requirements:

1.  It SHALL be irreversible in such a way that:

    1.  It SHALL prevent recovery of a unique identifier for the device by entities that do not already have access to the set of possible unique identifiers.

    2.  Leaking of a common key or equivalent could not be used to recover a unique identifier for all devices sharing the common key.

2.  It SHALL protect against long-term tracking by rotating upon each commencement of advertis­ ing.

3.  It SHALL have a total of at least 64 bits of entropy and SHOULD preferably have more, up to 256 bits.

4.  It SHALL NOT contain a fixed identifier such as a serial number.

> The [Rotating Device Identifier Algorithm](#_bookmark521) below meets these requirements. A Node that implements the Rotating Device Identifier SHALL use either the Rotating Device Identifier Algorithm or a differ­ ent algorithm which has been approved and verified by the Connectivity Standards Alliance for this purpose and which meets the same set of security and privacy requirements listed above.
>
> The Rotating Device Identifier Algorithm employs a key derivation algorithm that combines a monotonically increasing lifetime counter with a persistent unique per-device identifier.
>
> This persistent unique identifier SHALL consist of a randomly-generated 128-bit or longer octet string which SHALL be programmed during factory provisioning or delivered to the device by the vendor using secure means after a software update.
>
> This persistent unique identifier SHALL be protected against reading or writing over the air after initial introduction into the device, and stay fixed during the lifetime of the device.
>
> **NOTE** This persistent unique identifier SHALL NOT be the same as the UniqueID attribute exposed in the Basic Information cluster.
>
> The lifetime counter SHALL be an integer at least 16 bits in size, incremented upon each com­ mencement of advertising, and wrapping when the maximum value is reached.
>
> The Rotating Device Identifier Algorithm is defined as follows:

[TABLE]

> (where \|\| is the concatenation operation)
>
> The rotation counter is encoded as 2 bytes using little-endian encoding in the above algorithm, everywhere it appears.
>
> The Rotating Device ID is the concatenation of the current rotation counter and the 16 bytes of the [Crypto_KDF](#key-derivation-function-kdf) result.

1.  **TLV Example**

> Extended data containing just a Rotating Device Identifier would be encoded as the following bytes:

#### Using BLE

> This section provides details of how a device announces its commissionable status using BLE tech­ nology. As required in [Section 5.4.2.2, “Announcement Commencement”](#announcement-commencement), Nodes currently commis­ sioned into one or more fabrics or already connected to an IP-bearing network SHALL NOT employ this method.
>
> **NOTE** Need to add link(s) to BLE specification.

1.  **Device Role**

> Commissionable devices SHALL implement the role of a Generic Access Profile (GAP) Peripheral.

2.  **Channels**

> There are three advertising channels used by BLE. All three channels SHOULD be used by commis­ sionable devices for BLE advertising.

3.  **Interval**

> Commissionable devices SHOULD use an Advertising Interval between 20 ms and 60 ms for the first 30 seconds and a value between 150 ms to 1285 ms for the rest of the Announcement duration. Shorter intervals typically result in shorter discovery times.
>
> If a device opts to use [Extended Announcement](#_bookmark515), it SHALL switch to using an Advertising Interval larger or equal to 1200 ms and SHOULD use a nominal Advertising Interval of 1285 ms. When using Extended Announcement, the device SHALL set the Extended Announcement Flag in the Matter Service Data in the BLE Advertisement (see [Table 51, “Matter BLE Service Data payload format”](#_bookmark523)).

4.  **Advertising Mode**

> Commissionable devices SHALL use the GAP General Discoverable mode, sending connectable undirected advertising events.

5.  **Advertising Address**

> To ensure privacy, commissionable devices SHALL use LE Random Device Address (see [Bluetooth®](#_bookmark20) [Core Specification 4.2](#_bookmark20) Vol 6, Part B, Section 1.3.2.1 "Static device address") for BLE Advertising and SHALL change it at least on every boot.

6.  **Advertising Data**

> In order to reduce 2.4 GHz spectrum congestion due to active BLE scanning, and to extend battery life in battery-powered devices, all critical data used for device discovery is contained in the Adver­ tising Data rather than the Scan Response Data. This allows a BLE Commissioner to passively scan (i.e., not issue Scan Requests upon receiving scannable advertisements) and still be able to receive all information needed to commission a device.
>
> Note that if additional vendor-specific information is to be conveyed and does not fit within the Advertising Data, it may be included in the Scan Response Data. See [Section 5.4.2.8, “Manufacturer-](#manufacturer-specific-data) [specific data”](#manufacturer-specific-data) for details on including vendor-specific information.
>
> Advertising data for Matter discovery uses "Service Data - 16 bit UUID" advertisement data type (see [Bluetooth® Core Specification Supplement 11](#_bookmark21) Section 1.11 "Service Data"), with 16-bit UUID value of 0xFFF6 (see [Table 36, “SIG UUID assignment”](#_bookmark448)).
>
> The following fields are defined within the Matter service data:
>
> *Table 51. Matter BLE Service Data payload format*

[TABLE]

[TABLE]

> All multi-byte values are encoded in little-endian byte order within the service data payload.
>
> Devices MAY choose not to advertise either the VID and PID, or only the PID due to privacy or other considerations. When choosing not to advertise both VID and PID, the device SHALL set both VID and PID fields to 0. When choosing not to advertise only the PID, the device SHALL set the PID field to 0. A device SHALL NOT set the VID to 0 when providing a non-zero PID.
>
> The Using Extended Announcement flag SHALL be set while the device is in the [Extended](#_bookmark515) [Announcement](#_bookmark515) period and SHALL NOT be set during the initial [Announcement Duration](#announcement-duration).
>
> The following table details the contents of an exemplary Advertising PDU payload for Vendor ID 0xFFF1, Product ID 0x8000, Discriminator 0x3AB and with [GATT-based Additional Data](#_bookmark524) marked as present:
>
> *Table 52. Exemplary Matter BLE commissionable advertisement*

[TABLE]

> Note that the position of the fields within the Advertising PDU (e.g. Flags, 16-bit UUID Service Data, etc.) within a conformant advertisement MAY differ from the example above, since there are no
>
> ordering constraints for advertisement fields in the Length-Type-Value format used in BLE adver­ tisements.

7.  **GATT-based Additional Data**

> When the Additional Data Flag is set in the Matter Service Data in the BLE Advertisement, the com­ missioner MAY access additional commissioning-related data via an unencrypted read-only GATT characteristic C3 (see [Table 34, “BTP GATT service”](#_bookmark434)).
>
> The value of the C3 characteristic SHALL be set to the Extended Data payload of the Discovery Information (see [Section 5.4.2.4.4, “Extended Data”](#_bookmark519)).

#### Using Wi-Fi Public Action Frame

> This section provides details of how a device announces its commissionable status using Wi-Fi Pub­ lic Action Frame. As required in [Section 5.4.2.2, “Announcement Commencement”](#announcement-commencement), Nodes currently commissioned into one or more fabrics or already connected to an IP-bearing network SHALL NOT employ this method.

1.  **Device Role**

> Commissionable devices SHALL implement the role of a publisher in Wi-Fi Alliance Unsynchro­ nized Service Discovery ([WFA-USD](#_bookmark83)).

2.  **Channels**

> The Commissionable device advertises itself on channel 6 in the 2.4 GHz frequency band, which is the Default Publish Channel in [WFA-USD](#_bookmark83). Additionally, the Commissionable device also advertises itself on channels in the Publish Channel List. This Publish Channel List includes all 20 MHz chan­ nels in the 2.4 GHz frequency band and 5 GHz band (if supported) that are allowed per regulation in the geographical location.
>
> The Commissionable device iterates between advertising itself on the Default Publish Channel and on channels in the Publish Channel List per behavior described in [WFA-USD](#_bookmark83). For Commissionable devices to advertise on Dynamic Frequency Selection channels within the 5 GHz band, full compli­ ance with the regulatory requirements of the specific geographical location is mandatory.
>
> The Commissionable device can prioritize advertising on channels in the Publish Channel List in which it determines the presence of an IEEE 802.11 Basic Service Set. The Commissionable device can determine presence of an IEEE 802.11 Basic Service Set on a channel by scanning that channel passively (i.e., SHOULD NOT send Probe Requests) in order to reduce unnecessary transmissions in the shared spectrum.
>
> The detection of an IEEE 802.11 beacon on a particular channel serves as a strong indication of the presence of an IEEE 802.11 Basic Service Set operating on that same channel. Moreover, within the IEEE 802.11 beacon, a Commissionable device can find information about the regulatory domain it is currently located in, specifically in the Country Information Element.

3.  **Publisher Operating Parameters**

> Commissionable devices SHALL create a Publish instance by invoking the Publish Method, using
>
> argument values specified in [Table 53, “Publish method arguments values for discovery”](#_bookmark527). Little- endian encoding is used for all argument values.
>
> *Table 53. Publish method arguments values for discovery*

[TABLE]

> *Table 54. Wi-Fi Public Action Frame Device OpCode*

[TABLE]

> *Table 55. Wi-Fi Public Action Frame Device Information*

[TABLE]

> Some devices MAY choose not to advertise the Vendor ID and/or Product ID due to privacy or other considerations. These devices SHALL set the Vendor ID and Product ID to value 0 in the ser­ vice_specific_info. Extended Data is optionally present in service_specific_info. The Time to live value is set according to [Section 5.4.2.3, “Announcement Duration”](#announcement-duration). The recommended value of Announcement period is 100 TUs. 1 TU is equal to 1024 microseconds.
>
> Single-channel Publish State and Multiple-channels Publish State defined in [WFA-USD](#_bookmark83) govern the advertisement behavior.

1.  Single-channel Publish State: The Commissionable device operates in the Default Publish Chan­ nel during this state. The dwell period (the time spent on a channel) is randomly determined as N x 100 TU, where N is an integer randomly selected within the range \[Nmin, Nmax\].

2.  Multiple-channels Publish State: In this state, the publisher can operate in one or more channels from the Publish Channel List. The dwell period is randomly determined as M x 100 TU, where M is an integer randomly selected within the range \[Mmin, Mmax\]. The implementation of [WFA-](#_bookmark83) [USD](#_bookmark83) has flexibility to divide the dwell period across the channels in the Publish Channel List. The Commissionable device MAY publish on a subset of channels within each multiple-channels Publish State, and the minimum time spent on any one channel is 100 ms in [WFA-USD](#_bookmark83).

> If a device opts to use [Extended Announcement](#_bookmark515), it SHALL switch to using Nmin, Nmax, Mmin, and Mmax greater than or equal to 10, 15, 10, 15, respectively, and SHOULD use an Announcement period of 1000 TUs.
>
> **NOTE** These recommended values may be updated in a future version of the specification.

#### Using Existing IP-bearing Network

> This section details how a device that is already connected to an IP-bearing network advertises its commissionable state. The discovery protocols leverage IETF Standard DNS-based Service Discov­ ery \[[RFC 6763](#_bookmark63)\]. A device SHALL use multicast DNS \[[RFC 6762](#_bookmark62)\] on Wi-Fi and Ethernet networks to make itself discoverable. On Thread networks, a device SHALL use the Service Registration Protocol \[[SRP](#_bookmark80)\] and an Advertising Proxy \[[AdProx](#_bookmark17)\] running on a Thread Border Router to make itself discov­ erable. Additional details on application of the above protocols in Matter is found in [Section 4.3,](#discovery) [“Discovery”](#discovery). The encoding of the information required for discovery during the commissioning process is covered in [Section 4.3.1, “Commissionable Node Discovery”](#commissionable-node-discovery).

#### Manufacturer-specific data

> If needed, manufacturer-specific data MAY be advertised by a commissionable device using one of the following mechanisms, based on the supported commissioning technology. Commissioners receiving this data SHOULD treat it as opaque unless they have the need to and possess the ability to correctly interpret the information conveyed.

1.  **Using BLE**

> Any manufacturer-specific data may be included as a Manufacturer Specific Data AD type in the Advertising Data or in the Scan Response data.
>
> Note that to receive Scan Response data information the Commissioner has to perform BLE active scanning that, in addition to creating additional traffic in the shared 2.4 GHz unlicensed band, can delay device discovery and connection, increasing the overall time required to commission a device.

2.  **Using Wi-Fi Public Action Frame**

> Any manufacturer-specific data SHOULD be conveyed using the Vendor-specific attributes in [WFA-](#_bookmark83) [USD](#_bookmark83).

### Discovery by Commissioner

> How a Commissioner discovers a commissionable device depends on the networking technologies that device and the Commissioner supports (see [Section 5.4.2.1, “Announcement and Discovery](#announcement-and-discovery-using-multiple-technologies) [Using Multiple Technologies”](#announcement-and-discovery-using-multiple-technologies)). Though not all networking technologies must be supported by every device (see [Table 40, “Discovery Capabilities Bitmask”](#_bookmark473)), a Commissioner SHALL support Commis­ sioning (see [Section 5.5, “Commissioning Flows”](#commissioning-flows)) using existing IP network and over BLE (if having such interface) and SHOULD support commissioning over Wi-Fi Public Action Frame (if having Wi- Fi interface) .
>
> The following sections detail Commissioner behavior for each of these networking technologies. Though a QR or Manual Pairing code may be scanned or entered prior to discovery, it is not required to do so. However, after scan/entry of the code, the Discriminator, VID and PID elements are available to ensure that the intended device is discovered before proceeding to the connection phase of commissioning.

#### Using BLE

> Commissioners SHALL implement the role of a GAP Central. To discover a commissionable device advertising over BLE, a Commissioner SHALL perform a BLE scan across all three advertising chan­ nels with a sufficient dwell time, interval, and overall duration of scan. In order to promote quick discovery it is recommended that a Commissioner scan as aggressively as possible within the Com­ missioner device functionality/UX constraints. In addition, if manufacturer-specific data is not needed, a passive scan (*i.e.*, one that only listens for Advertisement PDUs and does not issue Scan Request PDUs).
>
> If discovery procedure is user initiated the scan interval SHOULD be set between 30 ms and 60 ms, and the scan window SHOULD be set to 30 ms. If discovery procedure is not user initiated (i.e., the
>
> Commissioner is scanning in the background), the device may use more relaxed scan, for example, the scan interval set to 1.28 seconds and scan window set to 11.25 ms.
>
> **NOTE** Recommended values are defined in Appendix A: Timers and Constants of [Blue­](#_bookmark20) [tooth® Core Specification 4.2](#_bookmark20), Vol 3, Part C.

#### Using Wi-Fi Public Action Frame

> **NOTE** Discovery and commissioning using Wi-Fi Public Action Frames is provisional.
>
> To discover a commissionable device advertising using Wi-Fi Public Action Frame (see [Section](#using-wi-fi-public-action-frame) [5.4.2.6, “Using Wi-Fi Public Action Frame”](#using-wi-fi-public-action-frame)), a Commissioner that supports commissioning using Wi- Fi Public Action Frame SHALL implement the role of a Subscriber in Wi-Fi Alliance Unsynchronized Service Discovery ([WFA-USD](#_bookmark83)). The Commissioner SHALL create an active or a passive subscribe instance by invoking the Subscribe Method using the argument values specified in [Table 56, “Sub­](#_bookmark533) [scribe method arguments values for discovery”](#_bookmark533) ([WFA-USD](#_bookmark83)).
>
> *Table 56. Subscribe method arguments values for discovery*

[TABLE]

> The recommended value of Query period is between 100 TUs and 600 TUs when Subscribe Type = Active. The Query period is not applicable when Subscribe Type = Passive. The Time to live value is set according to [Section 5.4.2.3, “Announcement Duration”](#announcement-duration).
>
> The Commissioner can create the subscribe instance on Default Publish Channel (channel 6 in the

4.  GHz band) or any of the 20 MHz channels in the 2.4 GHz frequency band or any of the 20 MHz channels in the 5 GHz frequency band, if supported (see [Section 5.4.2.6.2, “Channels”](#_bookmark526)). The fre­ quency and duration of the Commissioner’s presence on the channel where the subscribe instance is created are based on implementation. For swiftest device discovery in [WFA-USD](#_bookmark83), the Commis­ sioner SHOULD follow these guidelines:

    1.  Whenever possible, the Commissioner SHOULD create a subscribe instance on the Default Pub­ lish Channel.

    2.  If the Commissioner is already associated with an operational network on the 5 GHz band, it can still create a subscribe instance on the same operating channel. However, if Commissioner is not an Access Point and if the operating channel is a Dynamic Frequency Selection channel, then to ensure compliance with the local regulatory requirements, the Commissioner SHOULD choose either channel 44 or channel 149 in the 5 GHz band for the subscribe instance, whichever is permitted with a higher transmission power based on the regulatory domain. Access Points as Commissioners can choose to create subscribe instance on any operating chan­ nel, including Dynamic Frequency Selection channels.

> When the Commissioner discovers the \_matterc.\_udp service name published by a Commissionable device, and the Commissioner uniquely identifies the Commissionable device through [12-bit dis­](#_bookmark516) [criminator](#_bookmark516) or [Extended Data](#_bookmark519), then the Commissioner MAY proceed with the commissioning flow (see [Section 5.5, “Commissioning Flows”](#commissioning-flows)). When commissioning over Wi-Fi Public Action Frame, the Commissioner SHALL use concurrent connection commissioning flow. Any Commissionable device supporting Wi-Fi Public Action Frame commissioning SHALL support concurrent connection com­ missioning flow, indicating this capability in the [SupportsConcurrentConnection](#supportsconcurrentconnection-attribute) attribute of the [General Commissioning Cluster](#general-commissioning-cluster).
>
> During commissioning flow, the Commissioner and the Commissionable device SHALL use [WFA-](#_bookmark83) [USD](#_bookmark83) Service Discovery Frame (SDF) Follow-up messages to transport Matter messages until the Commissionable device joins the operational network. When a [WFA-USD](#_bookmark83) SDF Follow-up message is used to transport a Matter message, the Service Info field of the Service Descriptor Extension Attribute included in the Wi-Fi USD Follow-up message SHALL be used to encapsulate the Matter message. The value of its Service Protocol Type field SHALL be set to '3' to indicate Matter, and its Service Specific Info field SHALL carry the Matter message sent by the Commissionable device or the Commissioner.

#### Using Existing IP-bearing Network

> To discover a commissionable device over an existing IP-bearing network connection, the Commis­ sioner SHALL perform service discovery using DNS-SD as detailed in [Section 4.3, “Discovery”](#discovery), and more specifically in [Section 4.3.1, “Commissionable Node Discovery”](#commissionable-node-discovery).

## Commissioning Flows

> There are two commissioning flows depending upon the networking capability of the Commis­ sioner and Commissionee, namely concurrent connection commissioning flow and non-concurrent connection commissioning flow.
>
> For additional security requirements related to commissioning flows, refer to [Section 13.6, “Secu­](#security-best-practices)
>
> [rity Best Practices”](#security-best-practices) .
>
> A Commissioner and Commissionee with concurrent connection have the ability to maintain two network connections simultaneously. One connection is between the Commissioner (or Commis­ sionee) and the operational network (e.g., home Wi-Fi network or Thread network) that the Com­ missionee is being programmed to join. The second connection is between the Commissioner and Commissionee for commissioning as is referred to as commissioning channel. A Commissioner and Commissionee with non-concurrent connection capability cannot be simultaneously connected to both the operational network that the Commissionee is being configured to join, and the commis­ sioning channel.
>
> The two connections MAY either be on the same or on different networking interfaces. For exam­ ple, a Commissioner uses its Wi-Fi interface to connect to the operational network, but use its Blue­ tooth Low Energy interface for commissioning.
>
> To determine whether a Commissionee has concurrent or non-concurrent connection capability, the Commissioner can use the [SupportsConcurrentConnection](#supportsconcurrentconnection-attribute) attribute of the [General Commission­](#general-commissioning-cluster) [ing Cluster](#general-commissioning-cluster).
>
> Commissioning SHALL be a time-bound process that completes before expiration of a fail-safe timer. The fail-safe timer SHALL be set at the beginning of commissioning. If the fail-safe timer expires prior to commissioning completion, the Commissioner and Commissionee SHALL terminate commissioning. Successful completion of commissioning SHALL disarm the fail-safe timer.
>
> A Commissionee that is ready to be commissioned SHALL accept the request to establish a [PASE](#passcode-authenticated-session-establishment-pase) ses­ sion with the first Commissioner that initiates the request. When a Commissioner is either in the process of establishing a [PASE](#passcode-authenticated-session-establishment-pase) session with the Commissionee or has successfully established a ses­ sion, the Commissionee SHALL NOT accept any more requests for new PASE sessions until session establishment fails or the successfully established PASE session is terminated on the commissioning channel (see [CloseSession](#closesession) in [Secure Channel Status Report Messages](#secure-channel-status-report-messages)). In the event a [CloseSession](#closesession) status message is sent or received:

1.  If the fail-safe timer is armed, the fail-safe timer SHALL be considered expired and the cleanup steps detailed in [ArmFailSafe](#armfailsafe-command) SHALL be executed.

2.  If the commissioning window is still open, the Commissionee SHALL continue listening for com­ missioning requests.

> In order to avoid locking out the Commissionee from accepting new PASE session requests indefi­ nitely, a Commissionee SHALL expect a PASE session to be established within 60 seconds of receiv­ ing the initial request. This means the Commissionee SHALL expect to receive the [PAKE3](#_bookmark360) message within 60 seconds after sending a [PBKDFParamResponse](#_bookmark354) in response to a [PBKDFParamRequest](#_bookmark351) message from the Commissioner to establish a PASE session. If the PASE session is not established within the expected time window the Commissionee SHALL terminate the current session estab­ lishment using the [INVALID_PARAMETER](#_bookmark313) status code as described in [Section 4.11.1.3, “Secure Channel](#secure-channel-status-report-messages) [Status Report Messages”](#secure-channel-status-report-messages).
>
> The commissioning commands and attributes are defined in Clusters (see [Section 11.9, “Network](#network-commissioning-cluster) [Commissioning Cluster”](#network-commissioning-cluster), [Section 11.10, “General Commissioning Cluster”](#general-commissioning-cluster), [Section 11.14, “Thread](#thread-network-diagnostics-cluster) [Network Diagnostics Cluster”](#thread-network-diagnostics-cluster), and [Section 11.15, “Wi-Fi Network Diagnostics Cluster”](#wi-fi-network-diagnostics-cluster)) and are sent,
>
> written, or read using the Interaction Model (see [Interaction Model](#chapter-8.-interaction-model-specification)).
>
> [Figure 32, “Concurrent connection commissioning flow”](#_bookmark547) and [Figure 33, “Non-concurrent connec­](#_bookmark548) [tion commissioning flow”](#_bookmark548) depict the commissioning flow between the Commissioner and Commis­ sionee with concurrent connection ability and non-concurrent connection ability, respectively. The specific steps are described below. Unless indicated otherwise, a commissioner SHALL complete a step, including waiting for any responses to commands it sends in that step, before moving on to the next step.

1.  The Commissioner initiating the commissioning SHALL have regulatory and fabric information available, and SHOULD have accurate date, time and timezone.

2.  Commissioner and Commissionee SHALL find each other over networking interfaces such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or Ethernet using the process of discovery and establish a commissioning channel between each other (see [Section 5.4, “Device Discovery”](#device-discovery)).

3.  If the Commissioner and device support [Terms and Conditions (TC) Acknowledgement](#terms-and-conditions-tc-acknowledgement), then the Commissioner SHALL obtain the Terms and Conditions to present to the user from [Section](#enhancedsetupflowtcurl) [11.23.6.22, “EnhancedSetupFlowTCUrl”](#enhancedsetupflowtcurl).

4.  If the Commissioner and device support [Terms and Conditions (TC) Acknowledgement](#terms-and-conditions-tc-acknowledgement), the Com­ missioner SHALL present the Terms and Conditions to the user following [Terms and Conditions](#terms-and-conditions-tc-acknowledgement) [(TC) Acknowledgement](#terms-and-conditions-tc-acknowledgement), unless the Commissioner already has user provided responses that can be used.

5.  If the Commissioner and device support [Terms and Conditions (TC) Acknowledgement](#terms-and-conditions-tc-acknowledgement), and Terms and Conditions were presented in step [4](#_bookmark536), then the Commissioner SHALL receive the user responses to the provided terms for use in step [9](#_bookmark538).

6.  Commissioner and Commissionee SHALL establish encryption keys with PASE (see [Section](#passcode-authenticated-session-establishment-pase) [4.14.1, “Passcode-Authenticated Session Establishment (PASE)”](#passcode-authenticated-session-establishment-pase)) on the commissioning channel. All subsequent messages on the commissioning channel are encrypted using PASE-derived encryption keys. Upon completion of PASE session establishment, the Commissionee SHALL autonomously arm the [Fail-safe timer](#armfailsafe-command) for a timeout of 60 seconds. This is to guard against the Commissioner aborting the Commissioning process without arming the fail-safe, which may leave the device unable to accept additional connections.

7.  Commissioner SHALL re-arm the Fail-safe timer on the Commissionee to the desired commis­ sioning timeout within 60 seconds of the completion of PASE session establishment, using the ArmFailSafe command (see [ArmFailSafe](#armfailsafe-command)). A Commissioner MAY obtain device information including guidance on the fail-safe value from the Commissionee by reading BasicCommis­ sioningInfo attribute (see [BasicCommissioningInfo](#basiccommissioninginfo-attribute)) prior to invoking the [ArmFailSafe](#armfailsafe-command) com­ mand.

8.  The commissioner configures the regulatory information and time cluster as described below. The order of the operations in this commissioning step is not critical.

    - If the Commissionee has at least one instance of the [Network Commissioning cluster](#network-commissioning-cluster) on any endpoint with either the WI (i.e. Wi-Fi) or TH (i.e. Thread) [feature flags set](#features-10) in its FeatureMap, Commissioner SHALL configure regulatory information in the Commissionee using the [SetRegulatoryConfig](#setregulatoryconfig-command) command.

    - If the Commissionee supports the [Time Synchronization Cluster](#time-synchronization-cluster) server:

      - The Commissioner SHOULD configure UTC time using the [SetUTCTime](#setutctime-command) command.

      - The Commissioner SHOULD set the time zone using the [SetTimeZone](#settimezone-command) command, if the [TimeZone](#timezone-feature) feature is supported.

      - The Commissioner SHOULD set the DST offsets using the [SetDSTOffset](#setdstoffset-command) command if the [TimeZone](#timezone-feature) feature is supported, and the [SetTimeZoneResponse](#settimezoneresponse-command) from the Commissionee had the DSTOffsetsRequired field set to True.

      - The Commissioner SHOULD set a Default NTP server using the [SetDefaultNTP](#setdefaultntp-command) command if the [NTPClient](#ntpclient-feature) feature is supported and the [DefaultNTP](#defaultntp-attribute) attribute is null. If the current value is non-null, Commissioners MAY opt to overwrite the current value.

9.  If the [Terms & Conditions Enhanced Setup Flow](#terms-and-conditions-tc-acknowledgement) feature is supported by both the device and by the commissioner, and [TCAcknowledgementsRequired](#tcacknowledgementsrequired-attribute) is True, the Commissioner SHALL present them as documented in [Terms and Conditions Acknowledgement](#terms-and-conditions-tc-acknowledgement). The user’s responses SHALL be propagated back to the node with [SetTCAcknowledgements](#settcacknowledgements-command).

10. Commissioner SHALL establish the authenticity of the Commissionee as a certified Matter device (see [Section 6.2.3, “Device Attestation Procedure”](#device-attestation-procedure)).

    - If the Commissionee fails the Device Attestation Procedure, for any reason, the Commis­ sioner MAY choose to either continue to the Commissioning, or terminate it, depending on implementation-dependent policies.

    - Upon failure of the procedure, the Commissioner SHOULD warn the user that the Commis­ sionee is not a fully trusted device, and MAY give the user the choice to authorize or deny the commissioning. Such a warning enables user choice in Commissionee trust on their Fab­ ric, for development workflows, as well as homebrew device development. Such a warning SHOULD contain as much information as the commissioner can provide about the Commis­ sionee, and SHOULD be adapted to the reason of the failure, for example by being different between the case of an expired certificate versus a revoked PAI certificate.

    - Reasons for failing the Device Attestation procedure MAY include, but are not limited to, the following:

      - The Commissionee being of a device type currently in development or not yet certified (see [certification_type](#_bookmark594) in the [Certification Declaration](#certification-declaration-cd-format)).

      - The Commissionee’s PAA not being in the Commissioner’s trusted set.

      - The Commissioner having obtained knowledge that a [PAA or PAI certificate](#device-attestation-public-key-infrastructure-pki) presented has been revoked, or that the particular [Device Attestation Certificate](#device-attestation-certificate-dac) has been revoked (see [Section 6.2.4, “Device attestation revocation”](#device-attestation-revocation)).

      - The Commissioner cannot obtain a revocation set or cannot obtain updated revocation information from the CA (see [Section 6.2.4.2, “Determining Revocation Status of an](#determining-revocation-status-of-an-entity) [Entity”](#determining-revocation-status-of-an-entity)).

      - The Commissionee failing to prove possession of the Device Attestation private key, either by programming error, malicious intent or other reasons.

      - One of the elements of the Commissionee’s Device Attestation Certificate chain not meet­ ing the policy validation steps of the Device Attestation Procedure, including errors on validity period.

    - If a Commissioner denies commissioning for any reason, it SHOULD notify the user of the

> reason with sufficient details for the user to understand the reason, so that they could deter­ mine if it would be possible to commission the device using a different Commissioner.

11. Following the Device Attestation Procedure yielding a decision to proceed with commissioning, the Commissioner SHALL request operational CSR from Commissionee using the CSRRequest command (see [CSRRequest](#csrrequest-command)). The CSRRequest command will cause the generation of a new oper­ ational key pair at the Commissionee.

12. Commissioner SHALL generate or otherwise obtain an Operational Certificate containing Oper­ ational ID after receiving the CSRResponse command from the Commissionee (see [CSRRequest](#csrrequest-command)), using implementation-specific means.

13. Commissioner SHALL install operational credentials (see [Figure 43, “Node Operational Creden­](#_bookmark609) [tials flow”](#_bookmark609)) on the Commissionee using the [AddTrustedRootCertificate](#addtrustedrootcertificate-command) and [AddNOC](#addnoc-command) commands, and SHALL use the [UpdateFabricLabel](#updatefabriclabel-command) command to set a string that the user can recognize and relate to this Commissioner/Administrator.

> The AdminVendorId field of the AddNOC command SHALL be set to a value for which the [Ven­](#vendor-schema) [dor Schema in DCL](#vendor-schema) contains the name and other information of the Commissioner’s manufac­ turer.

14. If the Commissionee supports the [Time Synchronization Cluster](#time-synchronization-cluster) server, the Commissioner SHOULD set a trusted time source using the [SetTrustedTimeSource](#settrustedtimesource-command) command if the [TimeSync­](#timesyncclient-feature) [Client](#timesyncclient-feature) feature is supported, the [TrustedTimeSource](#trustedtimesource-attribute) attribute is null and there is an available trusted time source on the fabric. The Commissioner SHOULD ensure the ACL on the Trusted­ TimeSource is set to grant the Commissionee View privilege to the Time Synchronization clus­ ter. If the TrustedTimeSource is non-null, the Commissioner MAY opt to overwrite the current value with a node from its own fabric by sending the [SetTrustedTimeSource](#settrustedtimesource-command) command. This step MAY be performed at any point after installing operational credentials, including after sending the CommissioningComplete command.

15. Commissioner MAY configure the Access Control List (see [Section 9.10, “Access Control Cluster”](#access-control-cluster)) on the Commissionee in any way it sees fit, if the singular entry added by the [AddNOC](#addnoc-command) command in the previous step granting Administer privilege over [CASE](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case) authentication type for the Node ID provided with the command is not sufficient to express its desired access control policies.

> a\. The Commissioner MAY read the Commissioning Access Restriction List (see [Section 9.10,](#access-control-cluster) [“Access Control Cluster”](#access-control-cluster)) on the Commissionee in order to identify fabric restrictions. When restrictions exist, the Administrator MAY invoke the ReviewFabricRestrictions command on the same cluster in order to initiate the review process (see [Managed Device](#manageddevice-feature)), however, the Administrator SHALL wait until after commissioning completes before sending this com­ mand.

16. If the Commissionee both supports it and requires it, the Commissioner SHALL configure the operational network at the Commissionee using commands such as AddOrUpdateWiFiNetwork (see [AddOrUpdateWiFiNetwork](#addorupdatewifinetwork-command)) and AddOrUpdateThreadNetwork (see [AddOrUpdateThread­](#addorupdatethreadnetwork-command) [Network](#addorupdatethreadnetwork-command)). A Commissionee requires network commissioning if it is not already on the desired operational network. A Commissionee supports network commissioning if it has any [Network­](#network-commissioning-cluster) [Commissioning](#network-commissioning-cluster) cluster instances. A Commissioner MAY learn about the networks visible to the Commissionee using ScanNetworks command (see [ScanNetworks](#scannetworks-command)).

17. The Commissioner SHALL trigger the Commissionee to connect to the operational network using ConnectNetwork command (see [ConnectNetwork](#connectnetwork-command)) unless the Commissionee is already on the desired operational network.

18. Finalization of the Commissioning process begins. An Administrator configured in the ACL of the Commissionee by the Commissioner SHALL use [Operational Discovery](#operational-discovery) to discover the Com­ missionee. This Administrator MAY be the Commissioner itself, or another Node to which the Commissioner has delegated the task.

19. The Administrator SHALL open a CASE (see [Section 4.14.2, “Certificate Authenticated Session](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case) [Establishment (CASE)”](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case)) session with the Commissionee over the operational network.

20. The Administrator having established a CASE session with the Commissionee over the opera­ tional network in the previous steps SHALL invoke the CommissioningComplete command (see [CommissioningComplete](#commissioningcomplete-command)). A success response after invocation of the CommissioningComplete command ends the commissioning process.

> While the Administrator of steps [18](#_bookmark543)-[20](#_bookmark544) will, in many situations, be the Commissioner Node itself, it MAY be a different Node that was configured by the Commissioner to have Administer privilege against the Commissionee’s [General Commissioning Cluster](#general-commissioning-cluster). This is to support flexibility in finaliz­ ing the Commissioning. From a Commissionee’s perspective, all Nodes with Administer privilege in the Commissionee’s [ACL](#access-control-cluster) are equivalent once the Node has a [Node Operational Certificate](#node-operational-certificate-noc) and asso­ ciated [Node Operational Identifier](#node-operational-identifier-composition) on the Fabric into which it was just commissioned.
>
> A Commissioner MAY configure UTC time, Operational ID, and Operational certificates, etc., infor­ mation over an arbitrary number of interactions at the Commissionee, over the operational net­ work after the commissioning is complete, or over the commissioning channel after PASE-derived encryption keys are established during commissioning.
>
> In concurrent connection commissioning flow the commissioning channel SHALL terminate after successful step [20](#_bookmark544) (CommissioningComplete command invocation). In non-concurrent connection commissioning flow the commissioning channel SHALL terminate after successful step [17](#_bookmark542) (trigger joining of operational network at Commissionee). The PASE-derived encryption keys SHALL be deleted when commissioning channel terminates. The PASE session SHALL be terminated by both Commissioner and Commissionee once the CommissioningComplete command is received by the Commissionee.
>
> In both concurrent connection commissioning flow and non-concurrent connection commissioning flow, the Commissioner MAY choose to continue commissioning and override the failure in step [10](#_bookmark539) (Commissionee attestation).

### Commissioning Flows Error Handling

> Overall, all Commissioning operations employ actions using cluster attributes and commands that are also, in certain cases, available during normal steady-state operation once commissioned.
>
> If a Commissionee requires network commissioning, the Commissioner SHOULD attempt to config­ ure the [primary network interface](#_bookmark1375) on the Root Node endpoint initially.
>
> If the initial attempt fails for networking-related reasons, then the Commissioner SHOULD attempt to configure [secondary network interfaces](#_bookmark1376) via additional endpoints that have a server instance of the Network Commissioning cluster, if such endpoints exist.
>
> Before attempting to configure any such alternative interface, the commissioner SHALL revert net­ work configuration changes made as part of the preceding unsuccessful configuration attempt,
>
> specifically the [RemoveNetwork](#removenetwork-command) command SHALL be used to remove any Thread or Wi-Fi network configurations added by such an unsuccessful attempt. This ensures that when commissioning ulti­ mately succeeds, only the configuration changes relating to the network interface that was success­ fully configured will be committed by the [CommissioningComplete](#commissioningcomplete-command) command.
>
> The Commissioner MAY leverage out-of-band information to prioritize network interfaces, consid­ ering factors like the availability of Thread Border Routers, Wi-Fi Access Point status, and user pref­ erences.
>
> Whenever the [Fail-Safe timer](#armfailsafe-command) is armed, Commissioners and Administrators SHALL NOT consider any cluster operation to have timed-out before waiting at least 30 seconds for a valid response from the cluster server. Some commands and attributes with complex side-effects MAY require longer and have specific timing requirements stated in their respective cluster specification.
>
> Some request commands used for Commissioning and administration have a 'Breadcrumb' argu­ ment. When set, this argument SHALL be used to update the value of the [Breadcrumb Attribute](#breadcrumb-attribute) as a side-effect of successful execution of those commands. On command failures, the [Breadcrumb](#breadcrumb-attribute) [Attribute](#breadcrumb-attribute) SHALL remain unchanged.
>
> In concurrent connection commissioning flow, the failure of any of the steps [2](#_bookmark535) through [15](#_bookmark540) SHALL result in the Commissioner and Commissionee returning to step [2](#_bookmark535) (device discovery and commis­ sioning channel establishment) and repeating each step. The failure of any of the steps [16](#_bookmark541) through [20](#_bookmark544) in concurrent connection commissioning flow SHALL result in the Commissioner and Commis­ sionee returning to step [16](#_bookmark541) (configuration of operational network information), and MAY result in an attempt to configure secondary network interfaces. In the case of failure of any of the steps [16](#_bookmark541) through [20](#_bookmark544) in concurrent connection commissioning flow, the Commissioner and Commissionee SHALL reuse the existing PASE-derived encryption keys over the commissioning channel and all steps up to and including step [15](#_bookmark540) are considered to have been successfully completed.
>
> In non-concurrent connection commissioning flow, the failure of any of the steps [2](#_bookmark535) through [20](#_bookmark544) SHALL result in the Commissioner and Commissionee returning to step [2](#_bookmark535) (device discovery and commissioning channel establishment) and repeating each step.
>
> Commissioners that need to restart from step [2](#_bookmark535) MAY immediately expire the fail-safe by invoking the [ArmFailSafe command](#armfailsafe-command) with an ExpiryLengthSeconds field set to 0. Otherwise, Commissioners will need to wait until the current fail-safe timer has expired for the Commissionee to begin accept­ ing PASE again.
>
> In both concurrent connection commissioning flow and non-concurrent connection commissioning flow, the Commissionee SHALL exit Commissioning Mode after 20 failed attempts.
>
> Once a Commissionee has been successfully commissioned by a Commissioner into its fabric, the commissioned Node SHALL NOT accept any more PASE requests until any one of the following con­ ditions is met:

- Device is factory-reset.

- Device enters commissioning mode.

> Ongoing administration of Nodes by Administrators employs many of the same clusters and con­ straints related to Fail-Safe timer and cluster operation time-outs used for initial or subsequent
>
> Commissioning into new Fabrics. The respective cluster specifications for the [Node Operational](#node-operational-credentials-cluster) [Credentials Cluster](#node-operational-credentials-cluster) and the [Network Commissioning Cluster](#network-commissioning-cluster) reflect the necessary usage of the Arm­ FailSafe and CommissioningComplete commands of the [General Commissioning Cluster](#general-commissioning-cluster) to achieve consistent state during administrative operations.

## Administrator Assisted Commissioning Flows

### Introduction

> In this method, a current Administrator of a Node first sends the [OpenCommissioningWindow](#opencommissioningwindow-command) com­ mand to the Node over a [CASE](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case) session. The new Administrator SHALL already have network con­ nectivity and complete commissioning based on the two flows described below.
>
> The commands for these flows are defined in [Section 11.19, “Administrator Commissioning Clus­](#administrator-commissioning-cluster)
>
> [ter”](#administrator-commissioning-cluster).

### Basic Commissioning Method (BCM)

> This method is OPTIONAL for Nodes and Administrators/Commissioners to implement. In this method, the current Administrator SHALL send the [OpenBasicCommissioningWindow](#openbasiccommissioningwindow-command) command to the Node over a [CASE](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case) session. The Node SHALL advertise its presence over DNS-SD (see [Section](#using-existing-ip-bearing-network) [5.4.2.7, “Using Existing IP-bearing Network”](#using-existing-ip-bearing-network) and [Commissionable Node Discovery](#commissionable-node-discovery)) after receiving the [OpenBasicCommissioningWindow](#openbasiccommissioningwindow-command) command.
>
> The new Administrator’s Commissioner then completes commissioning with the Node using similar Commissioning flow as it would do for a factory-new device (although note that IP channel is used for discovery). It can either scan the QR code format or use the Manual Pairing Code format of the [Section 5.1, “Onboarding Payload”](#onboarding-payload) of the Node.
>
> The following steps describe a possible sequence of events for BCM commissioning:

1.  Current Administrator puts the Node in [OpenBasicCommissioningWindow](#openbasiccommissioningwindow-command) for a specified time window, and receives success response from the Node on the [OpenBasicCommissioningWindow](#openbasiccommissioningwindow-command) command.

> a\. When the targeted Node is a [ICD](#intermittently-connected-device-icd), the current Administrator can guide the user to perform some action to 'wake' the device from its sleep cycle.

2.  New Administrator completes commissioning within the prescribed window using steps out­ lined in [Figure 32, “Concurrent connection commissioning flow”](#_bookmark547).

### Enhanced Commissioning Method (ECM)

> This method SHALL be implemented for Nodes and Commissioners/Administrators. When using ECM, the Node’s current Administrator instructs the Node over a [CASE](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case) session, to go into [OpenCom­](#opencommissioningwindow-command) [missioningWindow](#opencommissioningwindow-command). It SHALL choose a new RANDOM passcode and SHALL compute and send the cor­ responding [PAKE](#password-authenticated-key-exchange-pake) passcode verifier to the Node. Actual value of the passcode SHALL NOT be sent to the Node. The current Administrator then presents the new passcode and discriminator as described [below](#presentation-of-onboarding-payload-for-ecm). The Node SHALL advertise its presence over DNS-SD (see [Section 5.4.2.7, “Using](#using-existing-ip-bearing-network) [Existing IP-bearing Network”](#using-existing-ip-bearing-network) and [Commissionable Node Discovery](#commissionable-node-discovery)) after receiving the [OpenCom­](#opencommissioningwindow-command) [missioningWindow](#opencommissioningwindow-command) command.

#### Presentation of Onboarding Payload for ECM

> Presentation of the passcode and other relevant information SHALL be done at least with one or more of the methods below, depending on the capabilities of the first Administrator opening the OCW:

1.  If a user interface display is supported, the temporary Onboarding Payload SHALL be displayed using a textual representation of the Manual Pairing Code, using the [11-digit variant](#_bookmark479): it SHALL NOT contain the VENDOR_ID or PRODUCT_ID as the onboarding of the node(s) using the ECM cannot be subject to User-Intent or Custom Flows.

2.  If a user interface display is supported, the temporary Onboarding Payload SHOULD also be dis­ played using the definitions included in [Section 5.1.3, “QR Code”](#qr-code) subject to the following con­

> straints:

1.  If only a single Node is being subjected to the ECM, the Vendor ID and Product ID in the [onboarding payload](#_bookmark472) SHALL be the same as those of that Node.

2.  If multiple Nodes are being subjected to the ECM using the same [onboarding payload](#_bookmark472), the Vendor ID SHALL be set to 0x0000 (Matter Standard) and the Product ID SHALL be set to 0x0000 (consistent with the value used for *not* advertising a Product ID in [Device Announce­](#announcement-by-device) [ment](#announcement-by-device)) .

3.  The Custom Flow element SHALL be set to 0 to indicate standard flow.

4.  The Discovery Capabilities Mask SHALL have ONLY bit 2 set to indicate the Node is only dis­ coverable on the IP network.

5.  The Passcode element SHALL be set by the existing Administrator to the same value as the passcode chosen for this ECM operation.

6.  The Discriminator element SHALL be set by the existing Administrator to the same value as the Discriminator parameter in [Section 11.19.8.1, “OpenCommissioningWindow Command”](#opencommissioningwindow-command).

7.  If multiple Nodes are subjected to ECM, the [Section 5.1.5, “TLV Content”](#tlv-content) SHALL contain an entry with kTag_NumberOfDevices containing the number of devices that are expected to par­ ticipate in the onboarding with this ECM operation.

8.  When the Commissioning Timeout parameter of the OCW command is set to less than the allowed maximum (15 minutes), the [Section 5.1.5, “TLV Content”](#tlv-content) SHALL contain an entry with kTag_CommissioningTimeout containing the value of the Commissioning Timeout parame­ ter used for this ECM operation.

&nbsp;

3.  If only audio output is supported, the temporary Onboarding Payload SHALL be delivered using a voice prompt of the Manual Pairing Code format. A method SHOULD be available for the user to have the pairing code repeated.

> Remote UIs, both visual and audio — such as a manufacturer-specific mobile app or a web UI — are expressly permitted in the set of acceptable mechanisms for conveyance of the onboarding infor­ mation.
>
> This method allows a current Administrator to set multiple Nodes for commissioning with a new administrator with an appropriate Commissioning Window, by opening a commissioning window using the [OpenCommissioningWindow](#opencommissioningwindow-command) command and sending the [PAKE](#password-authenticated-key-exchange-pake) passcode verifier to a series of Nodes. The new Administrator uses the information in [Manual Pairing Code](#manual-pairing-code) to discover the Nodes that are in Commissioning mode and commission them using the new passcode.
>
> The following steps describe a possible sequence of events for ECM commissioning:

1.  Current Administrator puts the Node(s) in commissioning mode for a specified time window with a new setup passcode, and receives success responses from the involved Node(s) on the [OpenCommissioningWindow](#opencommissioningwindow-command) command.

> a\. When one or more [ICD](#intermittently-connected-device-icd) are among the targeted Nodes, the current Administrator can guide the user to perform some action to 'wake' these devices from their sleep cycle.

2.  Current Administrator presents Onboarding Payload as described [above](#presentation-of-onboarding-payload-for-ecm).

3.  New Administrator completes commissioning within the prescribed window using steps out­

> lined in [Figure 32, “Concurrent connection commissioning flow”](#_bookmark547).

## Device Commissioning Flows

> This section describes the three different flows for out-of-box commissioning that a Matter device manufacturer may select for a given product. For each flow, a description is provided which includes actions required to place the device into commissioning mode, fields in the [Onboarding](#onboarding-payload-contents) [Payload](#onboarding-payload-contents) which identify the flow selected by the device manufacturer, fields in the [Distributed Com­](#devicemodel-schema) [pliance Ledger](#devicemodel-schema) that provide information used for commissioning and help the Commissioner pro­ vide the user with appropriate instructions, and requirements for device packaging relating to the Onboarding Payload. The three flows are the following:

- Standard Commissioning Flow

- User-Intent Commissioning Flow

- Custom Commissioning Flow

> Matter device manufacturers SHALL use the [Distributed Compliance Ledger](#distributed-compliance-ledger) to provide commis­ sioners with information and instructions for both initial and secondary commissioning, and SHOULD use this Ledger to provide links to the user guide, a link to a manufacturer app, and other pre-setup information, to enable an optimal commissioning flow without requiring bilateral arrangements between each commissioner manufacturer and each device manufacturer.
>
> Some fields in the Ledger SHALL or SHOULD be populated, depending on the type of commission­ ing flow, as detailed in the text below and in the [Distributed Compliance Ledger](#devicemodel-schema) section.

### Standard Commissioning Flow

- A Standard Commissioning Flow device SHALL be available for initial commissioning by any Matter commissioner.

- A Standard Commissioning Flow device, when in factory-new state, SHALL start advertising automatically upon power on (see [Commencement](#announcement-commencement)).

- A Standard Commissioning Flow device SHALL set [Custom Flow bits](#custom-flow) in the Onboarding Payload to indicate '0 - Standard Flow'.

&nbsp;

- A Standard Commissioning Flow device SHALL follow the rules for [Manual Pairing Code and QR](#manual-pairing-code-and-qr-code-inclusion) [Code Inclusion](#manual-pairing-code-and-qr-code-inclusion).

- For the case where the device has stopped advertising (e.g. user has powered on the device longer ago than the advertisement period), the manufacturer SHOULD provide guidance about how to bring the device back into advertising mode using the CommissioningModeInitial­ StepsHint field from the [Distributed Compliance Ledger](#devicemodel-schema). Commissioners SHOULD use this infor­ mation to guide the user for this case.

- When commissioning fails, the commissioner MAY also reference [Distributed Compliance](#devicemodel-schema) [Ledger](#devicemodel-schema) fields such as CommissioningFallbackUrl (see [Section 5.7.5, “Commissioning Fallback](#commissioning-fallback-mechanism) [Mechanism”](#commissioning-fallback-mechanism)), UserManualUrl, SupportUrl and ProductUrl to assist the user in further steps to resolve the issue(s).

- The [Distributed Compliance Ledger](#distributed-compliance-ledger) entries for Standard Commissioning Flow devices SHALL include the [CommissioningCustomFlow](#commissioningcustomflow) field set to '0 - Standard' and the [CommissioningMod­](#commissioningmodeinitialstepshint) [eInitialStepsHint](#commissioningmodeinitialstepshint) field set to a non-zero integer value, with bit 0 (Power Cycle) being set to 1. The [CommissioningModeInitialStepsInstruction](#commissioningmodeinitialstepsinstruction) field SHALL be set when CommissioningModeIni­ tialStepsHint has a Pairing Instruction dependency.

> *Table 57. Values of Ledger fields to represent Standard Commissioning Flow*

[TABLE]

### User-Intent Commissioning Flow

- A User-Intent Commissioning Flow device SHALL be available for initial commissioning by any Matter commissioner.

- A User-Intent Commissioning Flow device, when in factory-new state, SHALL NOT start adver­ tising automatically upon application of power (see [Commencement](#announcement-commencement)).

- To place a User-Intent Commissioning Flow device into advertising mode, some form of user interaction with the device beyond application of power is required (see [Pairing Hint Table](#_bookmark201)). If a Device Manufacturer setup artifact is required for this, beyond documentation, then the device

> is a [Custom Commissioning Flow](#custom-commissioning-flow) device and not a User-Intent Commissioning Flow device. The documentation MAY be printed or in the form of online documentation (e.g. [Section 11.23.6.15,](#usermanualurl) [“UserManualUrl”](#usermanualurl)).

- A User-Intent Commissioning Flow device SHALL follow the rules for [Manual Pairing Code and](#manual-pairing-code-and-qr-code-inclusion) [QR Code Inclusion](#manual-pairing-code-and-qr-code-inclusion).

- The [Distributed Compliance Ledger](#distributed-compliance-ledger) entries for User-Intent Commissioning Flow devices SHALL include the [CommissioningCustomFlow](#commissioningcustomflow) field set to '1 - User Intent' and the [CommissioningMod­](#commissioningmodeinitialstepshint) [eInitialStepsHint](#commissioningmodeinitialstepshint) field set to a non-zero integer value. Bit 0 (Power Cycle) in the [Commissioning­](#commissioningmodeinitialstepshint) [ModeInitialStepsHint](#commissioningmodeinitialstepshint) field SHALL be set to 0. The [CommissioningModeInitialStepsInstruction](#commissioningmodeinitialstepsinstruction) field SHALL be set when CommissioningModeInitialStepsHint has a Pairing Instruction depen­ dency.

- A User-Intent Commissioning Flow device SHALL set [Custom Flow bits](#custom-flow) in the Onboarding Pay­ load to indicate '1 - User Intent'.

- The commissioner SHOULD reference [Distributed Compliance Ledger](#devicemodel-schema) fields such as [Commis­](#commissioningmodeinitialstepshint) [sioningModeInitialStepsHint](#commissioningmodeinitialstepshint), [CommissioningModeInitialStepsInstruction](#commissioningmodeinitialstepsinstruction), UserManualUrl, and SupportUrl to assist the user during commissioning, e.g. to explain how to bring the device into commissioning mode.

> *Table 58. Values of Ledger fields to represent User-Intent Commissioning Flow*

[TABLE]

### Custom Commissioning Flow

- A Custom Commissioning Flow device SHALL require interaction with custom steps, guided by a service provided by the manufacturer for initial device setup, before it can be commissioned by any Matter commissioner.

- A Custom Commissioning Flow device that supports the [Enhanced Setup Flow](#enhanced-setup-flow-esf) SHALL include a usable [Onboarding Payload](#onboarding-payload-contents) on-device or in packaging, so that a Commissioner which supports the [Enhanced Setup Flow](#enhanced-setup-flow-esf) can commission the device using the information provided in the

> Onboarding Payload.

- A Custom Commissioning Flow device which does not support [Enhanced Setup Flow](#enhanced-setup-flow-esf) MAY include the [Onboarding Payload](#onboarding-payload-contents) on-device or in packaging.

&nbsp;

- If the Onboarding Payload is not included, then it SHALL be provided to the user through other means provided by the manufacturer.

&nbsp;

- A Custom Commissioning Flow device SHALL set [Custom Flow bits](#custom-flow) in the Onboarding Payload to indicate '2 - Custom'.

- The [Distributed Compliance Ledger](#devicemodel-schema) entries for Custom Commissioning Flow devices SHALL include:

&nbsp;

- the [CommissioningCustomFlow](#commissioningcustomflow) field set to '2 - Custom'

- the CommissioningModeInitialStepsHint with bit 0 (Power Cycle) set to 0 and bit 1 (Device Manufacturer URL) set to 1

- the [CommissioningCustomFlowUrl](#commissioningcustomflowurl) field populated in order to indicate to commissioners that initial commissioning can only be completed by the user visiting the URL contained therein.

> This URL will typically lead to a web page with relevant instructions and/or to a server which (e.g. by looking at the User-Agent) redirects the user to allow viewing, downloading, installing or using a manufacturer-provided means for guiding the user through the process and bring the device into a state that it is available for commissioning by any commissioner. Since the URL is retrieved from a DCL entry corresponding to a specific VID and PID combi­ nation, the device manufacturer MAY choose to use any constructed URL valid in a HTTP GET request (i.e. dedicated for the product the user wants to commission) such as, for exam­
>
> ple, <https://domain.example/download-install-app?vid=FFF1&pid=1234>.

- When a Commissioner encounters a device with [Custom Flow](#custom-flow) field (in Onboarding Payload) or its [CommissioningCustomFlow](#commissioningcustomflow) field (in [Distributed Compliance Ledger](#devicemodel-schema)) set to '2 - Custom', it SHOULD use the [CommissioningCustomFlowUrl](#commissioningcustomflowurl) to guide the user on how to proceed, unless it has alternative means to guide the user to successful commissioning (for example, if the com­ missioner supports the set of [EnhancedSetupFlowOptions](#enhancedsetupflowoptions) required by the device).

&nbsp;

- If a Commissioner follows or launches the [CommissioningCustomFlowUrl](#commissioningcustomflowurl) after a User request, it SHALL expand it as described in [Section 5.7.3.1, “CommissioningCustomFlowUrl](#commissioningcustomflowurl-format) [format”](#commissioningcustomflowurl-format).

&nbsp;

- If [EnhancedSetupFlowOptions](#enhancedsetupflowoptions) indicates to use the Enhanced Setup Flow and the flags indicated are supported by the Commissioner, then the commissioner SHOULD perform the required steps described in [Enhanced Setup Flow](#enhanced-setup-flow-esf) rather than following the [CommissioningCustom­](#commissioningcustomflowurl) [FlowUrl](#commissioningcustomflowurl).

- A manufacturer contemplating using this flow should realize that

&nbsp;

- This flow typically requires internet access to access the URL, so initial commissioning of the device may fail if there is no internet connection at that time/location.

- If the flow requires an app, it needs to be made available for popular platforms amongst the user population; some of their platforms running a commissioner (e.g. a smart speaker not running a popular mobile OS) may thus not be able to be used for the initial commissioning of such devices.

> *Table 59. Values of Ledger fields to represent Custom Commissioning Flow*

[TABLE]

#### CommissioningCustomFlowUrl format

> The CommissioningCustomFlowUrl MAY contain a query component (see [RFC 3986](#_bookmark47) section 3.4). If a query is present, it SHALL be composed of one or more key-value pairs:

- The query SHALL use the & delimiter between key/value pairs.

- The key-value pairs SHALL in the format name=\<value\> where name is the key name, and \<value\>

> is the contents of the value encoded with proper URL-encoded escaping.

- If key MTcu is present, it SHALL have a value of "\_" (i.e. MTcu=\_). This is the "callback URL (Call­

> backUrl) placeholder".

- If key MTop is present, it SHALL have a value of "\_" (i.e. MTop=\_). This is the "onboarding payload placeholder".

- Any key whose name begins with MT not mentioned in the previous bullets SHALL be reserved for future use by this specification. Manufacturers SHALL NOT include query keys starting with MT in either the CommissioningCustomFlowUrl or CallbackUrl unless they are referenced by a ver­ sion of this specification.

> When the CommissioningCustomFlowUrl for a Custom Commissioning Flow device includes the MTop key, the Passcode embedded in any Onboarding Payload placed on-device or in packaging SHALL NOT be one that can be used for secure channel establishment with the device. This requirement is intended to ensure a shared secret used for proof of possession will not be transferred to a server without user consent. A Custom Commissioning Flow device MAY utilize Onboarding Payload fields such as the Serial Number (see kTag_SerialNumber) to pass device identification to the server speci­ fied in CommissioningCustomFlowUrl, as these fields by themselves could not be used to gain access to the device on their own like the Passcode could.
>
> When the CommissioningCustomFlowUrl for a Custom Commissioning Flow device includes the MTop
>
> key, the Passcode embedded in any Onboarding Payload placed on-device or in packaging MAY be set to 0 in order to provide a hint to the Commissioner that it is not one that can be used for secure channel establishment with the device. This would allow the Commissioner to avoid attempting to commission the device if an advertisement from it is detected.
>
> Any other element in the CommissioningCustomFlowUrl query field not covered by the above rules, as well as the fragment field (if present), SHALL remain as obtained from the [Distributed Compliance](#devicemodel-schema) [Ledger](#devicemodel-schema)'s CommissioningCustomFlowUrl field, including the order of query key/value pairs present.

1.  **Expansion of CommissioningCustomFlowUrl by Commissioner**

> Once the URL is obtained, it SHALL be expanded to form a final URL (ExpandedCommissioningCustom­ FlowUrl) by proceeding with the following substitution algorithm on the original CommissioningCus­ tomFlowUrl:

1.  If key MTcu is present, compute the CallbackUrl desired (see [Section 5.7.3.2, “CallbackUrl format](#callbackurl-format-for-custom-commissioning-flow-response) [for Custom Commissioning Flow response”](#callbackurl-format-for-custom-commissioning-flow-response)), and substitute the placeholder value "\_" (i.e. in MTcu=\_) in the CommissioningCustomFlowUrl with the desired contents, encoded with proper URL- encoded escaping (see [RFC 3986](#_bookmark47) section 2).

2.  If key MTop is present, substitute the placeholder value "\_" (i.e. in MTop=\_) in the CommissioningCus­ tomFlowUrl with either [numeric manual code](#_bookmark478), or [QR code body](#qr-code) including the MT: prefix and TLV data (if present), encoded with proper URL-encoded escaping (see [RFC 3986](#_bookmark47) section 2). Note that both methods SHOULD be supported by the Manufacturer’s custom flow.

> A Commissioner SHALL NOT append the MTop= query key/value pair unless the key/value pair was already present as MTop=\_ in the CommissioningCustomFlowUrl previously obtained. This constraint enables the determination of which products make use of the payload in their Custom Commission­ ing Flow infrastructure by inspection of the Distributed Compliance Ledger records.
>
> The final URL after expansion (ExpandedCommissioningCustomFlowUrl) SHALL be the one to follow per [Section 5.7.3, “Custom Commissioning Flow”](#custom-commissioning-flow), rather than the original value obtained from the Dis­ tributed Compliance Ledger.

#### CallbackUrl format for Custom Commissioning Flow response

> If a CallbackUrl field (i.e. MTcu=) query field placeholder is present in the [CommissioningCustom­](#commissioningcustomflowurl-format) [FlowUrl](#commissioningcustomflowurl-format), the Commissioner MAY replace the placeholder value "\_" in the ExpandedCommissioningCus­ tomFlowUrl with a URL that the manufacturer custom flow can use to make a smooth return to the Commissioner when the device is in a state that it can be commissioned.
>
> This URL field MAY contain a query component (see [RFC 3986](#_bookmark47) section 3.4). If a query is present, it SHALL be composed of one or more key-value pairs:

- The query SHALL use the & delimiter between key/value pairs.

- The key-value pairs SHALL follow the format name=\<value\> where name is the key name, and

> \<value\> is the contents of the value encoded with proper URL-encoded escaping.

- If key MTrop is present, it SHALL have a value of "\_" (i.e. MTrop=\_). This is the placeholder for a "returned onboarding payload" provided by the manufacturer flow to the Commissioner.

  - Any key whose name begins with MT not mentioned in the previous bullets SHALL be reserved for future use by this specification.

> Any other element in the CallbackUrl query field not covered by the above rules, as well as the frag­ ment field (if present), SHALL remain as provided by the Commissioner through embedding within the ExpandedCommissioningCustomFlowUrl, including the order of query key/value pairs present.

1.  **Expansion of CallbackUrl by the manufacturer custom flow**

> Once the CallbackUrl is obtained by the manufacturer flow, it MAY be expanded to form a final ExpandedCallbackUrl URL to be used by proceeding with the following substitution algorithm on the provided CallbackUrl:

- If key MTrop is present, the manufacturer custom flow having received the initial query contain­ ing the CallbackUrl MAY compute an [Onboarding Payload](#onboarding-material-representation) in QR code format including MT: pre­ fix, and substitute the placeholder value "\_" (i.e. in MTrop=\_) in the CallbackUrl with the desired contents, encoded with proper URL-encoded escaping (see [RFC 3986](#_bookmark47) section 2).

  - The contents of the MTrop=\_ key/value pair in the ExpandedCallbackUrl SHALL only be expanded if the manufacturer custom flow, having received the initial query containing the CallbackUrl, supports opening a commissioning window on the target device and supports conveying the corresponding onboarding payload to the Commissioner.

  - The return onboarding payload, if provided, SHALL contain an ephemeral Passcode and not a permanent code that can be used in a subsequent commissioning window. If the manufac­ turer wants the Passcode embedded in the Onboarding Payload placed on-device or in pack­ aging to be the one used for session establishment with the Commissioner, then the manu­ facturer SHALL NOT include the MTop key in its CommissioningCustomFlowUrl and SHALL NOT populate the MTrop value in the CallbackUrl expansion.

  - The contents of the return onboarding payload, if provided, SHALL be constructed to match the state of the device at the moment the ExpandedCallbackUrl is opened. At least one ingredi­ ent which needs to be adapted relative to the received Onboarding Payload is the Custom Flow field which needs to be 0 for the return onboarding payload.

  - The presence of this field is to assist automatically resuming commissioning without addi­ tional data entry (QR code or numeric manual code) by the user at the Commissioner that initially triggered the custom flow. The manufacturer custom flow SHOULD provide an alter­ nate means of conveying the onboarding payload, such as a manual pairing code.

  - Note that if the information in the initial onboarding payload that caused triggering of a Custom Commissioning Flow was directly usable, it may be used by the Commissioner, either upon being triggered through the ExpandedCallbackUrl having been opened, or autonomously as a fallback.

  - Commissioners providing a CallbackUrl to the manufacturer custom flow through the [ExpandedCommissioningCustomFlowUrl](#commissioningcustomflowurl-format) SHOULD support using the ExpandedCallbackUrl to trig­ ger resumption of Commissioning flow if the ExpandedCallbackUrl is followed, otherwise the Commissioner SHOULD NOT substitute the MTcu query field when expanding the Commission­ ingCustomFlowUrl into the ExpandedCommissioningCustomFlowUrl.

  - If the manufacturer custom flow failed to make the device commissionable, it SHALL NOT replace the placeholder value "\_" of an included MTrop=\_ key/value pair, to avoid a Commis­

> sioner attempting to discover or commission a device not made ready by the custom flow.
>
> A manufacturer custom flow having received an ExpandedCommissioningCustomFlowUrl SHOULD attempt to open the ExpandedCallbackUrl, on completion of the steps, if an ExpandedCallbackUrl was computed from the CallbackUrl and opening such a URL is supported.

#### Example Custom Commissioning Flow

> An example of this flow is illustrated below. The "DCL info" concept denotes that the Commissioner SHALL collect the information from the DCL via some mechanism, such as a network resource
>
> accessible to the Commissioner containing a replicated set of the DCL’s content.

![](media/image38.jpeg)

> *Figure 35. Custom Commissioning Flow sequence diagram*
>
> In the flow above:

- In the final steps, the User might have to perform the trigger to the first Commissioner, so that it can start or continue the commissioning process.

- If possible, a Commissioner MAY continue to scan for announcements from the device in the background while any manufacturer-specific app is configuring the device to be available for commissioning. The Commissioner might need a new OnboardingPayload provided to the User by the Manufacturer Website or App.

- In order to simplify the flow, the Commissioner MAY:

&nbsp;

- Include the onboarding payload obtained from the user (see MTop key in [Section 5.7.3.1,](#commissioningcustomflowurl-format) [“CommissioningCustomFlowUrl format”](#commissioningcustomflowurl-format)) within the CommissioningCustomFlowUrl.

- Include a callback URL (see MTcu key in [Section 5.7.3.1, “CommissioningCustomFlowUrl for­](#commissioningcustomflowurl-format) [mat”](#commissioningcustomflowurl-format)) within the ExpandedCommissioningCustomFlowUrl.

&nbsp;

- The Manufacturer Website or App MAY utilize the CallbackUrl field, if provided in the query string, in order to simplify the process for signaling the completion of the manufacturer-specific part of the flow back to the Commissioner. When doing so, the Manufacturer Website or App SHOULD put the device into Commissioning mode and SHOULD provide the corresponding onboarding payload to the Commissioner using the MTrop key/value pair within the [Expanded­](#callbackurl-format-for-custom-commissioning-flow-response) [CallbackUrl](#callbackurl-format-for-custom-commissioning-flow-response).

### Enhanced Setup Flow (ESF)

> The Enhanced Setup Flow feature provides an optional way for a Custom Commissioning Flow
>
> device to specify in a standardized way a set of additional commissioning steps that a device requires which are not included in the Standard Commissioning Flow performed by commission­ ers. For example, some devices require the user to read and accept a set of terms and conditions provided by the manufacturer before the device setup can complete. Since Standard Commission­ ing Flow does not include this functionality, a device with this requirement is compelled to use Cus­ tom Commissioning Flow. The Enhanced Setup Flow feature allows a commissioner which under­ stands how to perform the additional commissioning steps required by a device to replace the Cus­ tom Commissioning Flow by performing the additional commissioning steps as part of an enhanced Standard Commissioning Flow.
>
> For the Enhanced Setup Flow feature, additional commissioning steps are defined such as the need for a Terms and Conditions acknowledgement. A Custom Commissioning Flow device can indicate via [Enhanced Setup Flow Options](#enhancedsetupflowoptions) whether it supports the Enhanced Setup Flow feature and if so, which of the defined common additional commissioning steps it requires.

- A manufacturer contemplating using this flow has to consider that:

  - Enhanced Setup Flow needs to be supported by the Commissioner in order to be used during commissioning.

  - If Enhanced Setup Flow is not supported by the commissioner, then the commissioner and device both need to support [Custom Commissioning Flow](#custom-commissioning-flow) in order for the device to be suc­ cessfully commissioned.

> **NOTE** Support for the Enhanced Setup Flow is provisional.
>
> *Table 60. Enhanced Setup Flow Options Values*

| **Bit index** | **Name** | **Description** |
|----|----|----|
| 0 | TC on initial Commission | A commissioner is required to show Terms and Conditions content if this is the initial com­ missioning for the device out of a factory-reset state. |
| 1 | Disallow user TC responses reuse for required TC | The commissioner SHALL NOT reuse user’s responses to the required Terms and Conditions from commissioning a previous product (same VID) with the same T&C. |
| 2 | Disallow user TC responses reuse for non-required TC | The commissioner SHALL NOT reuse user’s responses to the non-required Terms and Condi­ tions from commissioning a previous product (same VID) with the same T&C. |

| **Bit index** | **Name** | **Description** |
|----|----|----|
| 3 | Disallow user TC responses reuse between PIDs | The commissioner SHALL NOT reuse user’s responses to the Terms and Conditions from commissioning a previous prod­ uct (same VID, other PID) with the same T&C. |

#### Terms and Conditions (TC) Acknowledgement

> One additional step defined in the Enhanced Setup Flow feature involves the display and collection of user acknowledgement of a set of Terms and Conditions defined by the device manufacturer. Commissioners that support this feature SHALL obtain the set of Terms and Conditions texts from the URL defined in [Enhanced Setup Flow Url](#enhancedsetupflowtcurl). This file SHALL only be used when successfully vali­ dated using [Section 11.23.6.24, “EnhancedSetupFlowTCDigest”](#enhancedsetupflowtcdigest), [Section 11.23.6.25, “EnhancedSe­](#enhancedsetupflowtcfilesize) [tupFlowTCFileSize”](#enhancedsetupflowtcfilesize), and the [TC File Format](#terms-and-conditions-file-format). When the ESF file is not found, or validation fails, the Commissioner SHALL proceed using the Custom Commissioning Flow.
>
> The Commissioner SHALL present the terms in a such a way that the user is given primary focus on the text and the text is not hidden, obscured, or omitted, unless allowed by exceptions indicated in this section. The user SHALL be given an option to either accept or decline each of the provided texts. If the user declines any text that are marked as required, then the commissioner SHALL end commissioning and notify the user that the device cannot be commissioned due to their refusal of the terms.

#### Reuse of Cached Acknowledgements

> In certain cases, such as commissioning multiple instances of the same or similar product, the device manufacturer might not require repeated acknowledgements for each instance.
>
> Examples (the corresponding setting of the bits is indicated in the table below)

1.  A manufacturer of motion sensors (same PID) requires acknowledgement of the T&C only when commissioning the first motion sensor - but not for a Smoke/CO sensor (other PID) from same manufacturer - not allowing reuse of acceptance between PIDs.

2.  A manufacturer of luminaires of different sizes (various PIDs) requires acknowledgement of the T&C only when commissioning the first luminaire - allowing reuse of acceptance between PIDs with same T&C.

3.  A manufacturer of a range of cameras has both required and non-required T&C. The non- required T&C concern uploading video stills to a manufacturer’s server for e.g. storage and delayed replay. The user’s consent to the non-required T&C (for remote data storage) can be dif­ ferent on how/where the camera is used. For example, they might want to allow this for a cam­ era overlooking the front yard, but not for a camera in a bedroom. In this case, the "Disallow user TC responses reuse for non-required TC" bit is set to 1, which would make the commis­ sioner present the required T&C only once, but present the non-required T&C for every camera device being commissioned, so the user can make a decision on remote data storage for each camera separately.

> The table below defines when caching MAY be used, based on the bits "Disallow user TC responses reuse for required TC", "Disallow user TC responses reuse for non-required TC" and "Disallow user TC responses reuse between PIDs" of [EnhancedSetupFlowOptions](#_bookmark562). In conditions marked with yes in the table, a commissioner MAY cache a user’s acknowledgements and use them for future commis­ sioning of products with the same T&C. In conditions marked with no, the commissioner SHALL NOT use a cached user’s acknowledgements.
>
> *Table 61. Enhanced Setup Flow - Use of Cached Acknowledgements*

| **Bit 1** | **Bit 2** | **Bit 3** | **same PID, required T&C** | **same PID, non- required T&C** | **other PID, required T&C** | **other PID, non- required T&C** | **example** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | yes | yes | yes | yes | 2 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | yes | no | yes | no | 3 |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | yes | yes | no | no | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | yes | no | no | no |  |
| 1 | x | x | no | no | no | no |  |

> Reuse of cached acknowledgements SHALL NOT be used when the VID for the product currently being commissioned is different from the product for which the user has reviewed and acknowl­ edged the T&C.
>
> If a Commissioner caches Terms and Conditions acknowledgement responses, then it SHOULD also provide the user a way to remove or update the cached responses. For example, an option could be provided to the user for removing all saved responses, ensuring they would be prompted with Terms and Conditions the next time they commissioned a device which previously had cached responses.
>
> **5.7.4.2.1. Definition of "same T&C"**
>
> The above text uses the phrase "same T&C". Caching SHALL NOT be done when the ESF file pre­ sented to the user has changed between when they reviewed and acknowledged it and the current commissioning, i.e. if values of one or both of [EnhancedSetupFlowTCDigest](#enhancedsetupflowtcdigest) and [EnhancedSe­](#enhancedsetupflowtcrevision) [tupFlowTCRevision](#enhancedsetupflowtcrevision) have changed.

#### Use of T&C Acknowledgment during the Custom Commissioning Flow

> When [Custom Commissioning Flow](#custom-commissioning-flow) is used for displaying Terms and Conditions, the manufacturer- provided means for obtaining user consent SHALL ensure that commissioning can be completed by the original commissioner without performing Terms and Conditions steps by setting [TCAcknowl­](#tcacknowledgementsrequired-attribute) [edgementsRequired](#tcacknowledgementsrequired-attribute) to False, [TCAcceptedVersion](#tcacceptedversion-attribute) to the accepted version of the Terms and Condi­ tions, and [TCAcknowledgements](#tcacknowledgements-attribute) with the responses provided by the user.
>
> A manufacturer contemplating using Terms and Conditions should realize that extending or adding them to a product using software updates needs to be considered with great care and SHOULD be avoided to prevent consumer frustration. For example:

- Extending the list of required terms (more requirements that the user MUST agree to) has the risk that the user will not accept the new terms and be confronted with a device which will longer function as before.

- Adding Terms and Conditions to a product which previously did not have them will likely result in confusion with the user who could be confronted with a Terms and Conditions dialog after the update.

#### Example of Enhanced Setup Flow for Terms and Conditions

![](media/image39.png)

> *Figure 36. Enhanced Setup Flow TC commissioning sequence diagram*

#### Presenting Updated Terms and Conditions

> When required by the manufacturer, a device MAY update [TCMinRequiredVersion](#tcminrequiredversion-attribute) and set [TCAc­](#tcacknowledgementsrequired-attribute) [knowledgementsRequired](#tcacknowledgementsrequired-attribute) to True, indicating to an Administrator that updated Terms and Condi­ tions are available for presentation to the user. The Administrator SHOULD subscribe to the [TCAc­](#tcacknowledgementsrequired-attribute) [knowledgementsRequired](#tcacknowledgementsrequired-attribute) attribute in order to detect this situation. The Administrator SHOULD present the updated Terms and Conditions in a similar manner to how they would be presented during the commissioning flow, as documented in [Terms and Conditions Acknowledgement](#terms-and-conditions-tc-acknowledgement). The user’s responses SHALL be propagated back to the node with [SetTCAcknowledgements](#settcacknowledgements-command).
>
> Until new acknowledgements have been received, the device MAY operate with limited functional­ ity related to such functionality for which the updated Terms & Conditions are more restrictive than the agreed ones - until new acknowledgements have been received. Since Administrators are recommended but not required to present updated Terms and Conditions to the user, any such limi­ tation in functionality could lead to a potentially confusing and frustrating experience for the user. As a result, this condition SHOULD be avoided by the manufacturer if possible. If a device opts to enforce updated Terms and Conditions in this way, then it SHOULD inform the user of this require­ ment in the provided Terms and Conditions and use [TCUpdateDeadline](#tcupdatedeadline-attribute) to indicate the deadline before any action takes place. If [TCUpdateDeadline](#tcupdatedeadline-attribute) is non-null, then the Administrator SHOULD inform the user by when they must accept the updated Terms and Conditions to avoid any impact
>
> to device functionality. Any interactions which cannot succeed due to this functionality limitation SHALL return the TERMS_AND_CONDITIONS_CHANGED failure status code. An administrator encountering this status code SHOULD direct the user to the URL located at [EnhancedSetupFlow­](#enhancedsetupflowmaintenanceurl) [MaintenanceUrl](#enhancedsetupflowmaintenanceurl), where the user can be directed on required actions for resolution. Upon satisfac­ tory acceptance of the updated Terms and Conditions, the device SHALL operate with the function­ ality of the related features, taking into account the user response.
>
> Where re-use of T&C acceptance between products is allowed (see [Section 5.7.4.2, “Reuse of Cached](#reuse-of-cached-acknowledgements) [Acknowledgements”](#reuse-of-cached-acknowledgements), upon acceptance of acknowledgements for a new [EnhancedSetupFlowTCRevi­](#enhancedsetupflowtcrevision) [sion](#enhancedsetupflowtcrevision) by the user, the Administrator MAY set the latest acknowledgements to all applicable devices using SetTCAcknowledgements.

> *Figure 37. Presenting updated Enhanced Setup Flow features diagram*

#### Terms and Conditions File Format

> The file contained at [EnhancedSetupFlowTCUrl](#enhancedsetupflowtcurl) is a JSON file containing the localized version of the texts to be displayed to the user for the Enhanced Setup Flow Terms & Conditions. Encoding of the file SHALL be UTF-8.

1.  **schemaVersion Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the version of the JSON schema format. This helps in managing changes to the structure of the schema over time. Whenever there is a change to the schema (such as adding, removing, or modifying fields), the schemaVersion SHALL be incremented. This ensures that the software processing these configuration files can recognize which version of the schema it is dealing with and handle it appropriately.
>
> This field SHALL be present in the ESF file.

2.  **esfRevision Field**

> This field is a 16-bit integer version number of the file that SHALL match the Version at [Enhanced­](#enhancedsetupflowtcrevision)
>
> [SetupFlowTCRevision](#enhancedsetupflowtcrevision).
>
> This field SHALL be present in the ESF file.

3.  **defaultCountry Field**

6.  **languageEntries Field**

> This field contains a list of the different texts to be displayed using the associated language as the key.
>
> This field SHALL be present in the ESF file for each entry in countryEntries and contain at least one entry.

7.  **ordinal Field**

> This field SHALL specify which bit number this text maps to in [TCAcknowledgements](#tcacknowledgements-attribute). Each bit in the map SHALL keep the same purpose through the life of the product to ensure a correct interpre­ tation of a user’s response across device firmware versions.
>
> This field SHALL be present in the ESF file for each entry in countryEntries.

8.  **required Field**

> This field is a boolean that indicates whether the corresponding text is required for the device’s functionality. If set to true, the user must accept this condition to commission the device.
>
> This field SHALL be present in the ESF file for each entry in the list of terms under the language key in languageEntries.

9.  **title Field**

> This field is a string that represents the title to use for the terms and conditions subsection when presenting the text. It MAY contain the following subset of HTML tags and their corresponding clos­ ing tags to allow for basic formatting of the presented title. Other HTML tags SHALL NOT be used.
>
> The permitted HTML tags are: \<b\>, \<em\>, \<i\>, \<small\>, \<strong\>, and \<u\>.
>
> This field SHALL be present in the ESF file for each entry in the list of terms under the language key in languageEntries.

10. **text Field**

### Commissioning Fallback Mechanism

> Commissioning using any of the methods described above can potentially fail for a number of rea­ sons. In some cases this will be a transient failure (e.g., due to wireless interference), while in other cases failure will be systematic (e.g., a mismatch in capabilities of the Commissioner and the Com­ missionee).
>
> Especially for the latter cases, a fallback mechanism is defined which allows the Commissioner to direct the user to a manufacturer-provided mechanism where the user can be guided towards reso­ lution of the issues since the manufacturer typically has more knowledge about the specific device than the commissioner.
>
> Examples of means that could be employed to attempt to resolve the issues:

- The [CommissioningFallbackUrl](#commissioningfallbackurl) can lead to a web page listing suggestions to resolve the failure (e.g., "restart the device to start another commissioning attempt" which helps in case the 15 minute announcement interval since power-on had expired before commissioning was attempted)

- The [CommissioningFallbackUrl](#commissioningfallbackurl) can lead to a manufacturer-provided mechanism to get the device on the IP-bearing network (which can then be followed by "[commissioning while already](#using-existing-ip-bearing-network) [on IP-network](#using-existing-ip-bearing-network)").

#### Commissioning Fallback flow for Device Manufacturers

> For cases where commissioning failure can be anticipated (such as devices which rely on commis­ sioning via a technology which is not mandatory for Commissioners e.g. supporting only commis­ sioning via [Wi-Fi Public Action Frame](#using-wi-fi-public-action-frame)), the [CommissioningFallbackUrl](#commissioningfallbackurl) and [DiscoveryCapabilities­](#discoverycapabilitiesbitmask) [Bitmask](#discoverycapabilitiesbitmask) fields in the [DeviceModel schema](#devicemodel-schema) in the [DCL](#devicemodel-schema) SHALL be populated. For the [Manual Pairing](#manual-pairing-code) [Code](#manual-pairing-code) for such a product, the [Encoding Method with Vendor and Product ID’s included](#_bookmark480) SHALL be used so the Commissioner has access to the VendorID and ProductID for DCL-lookup of the URL.
>
> For other cases, this field MAY be populated to provide a manufacturer-provided mechanism in case commissioning fails for any (other) reason.

#### Commissioning Fallback flow for Commissioners

> When a Commissioner encounters a situation where the commissioning fails systematically (e.g., due to a mismatch in capabilities of the Commissioner and the Commissionee), and it has no other means to guide the user to resolution of the issues, it SHALL use the [CommissioningFallbackUrl](#commissioningfallbackurl) (when provided) in the [DeviceModel schema](#devicemodel-schema) in the [DCL](#devicemodel-schema) to guide the user to the manufacturer-pro­ vided means towards resolution of the commissioning issues.

- In cases where using this URL is technically impossible (e.g. a headless commissioner, or the lack of internet access) or when the Commissioner is performing offline mode commissioning, the Commissioner SHOULD inform the user of the assumed reason for commissioning failure, and MAY provide additional advice on how this could potentially be resolved.

> When a Commissioner encounters a situation where the commissioning failure is transient, the Commissioner MAY try again; it also MAY use the [CommissioningFallbackUrl](#commissioningfallbackurl) (when provided) to guide the user to the manufacturer-provided means towards resolution of the commissioning issues.

#### URL used in Commissioning Fallback Mechanism

> The [CommissioningFallbackUrl](#commissioningfallbackurl) MAY be constructed in the same way as the [CommissioningCustom­](#commissioningcustomflowurl) [FlowUrl](#commissioningcustomflowurl) field, including making it specific for a particular VendorID and/or ProductID (as described in [Section 5.7.3, “Custom Commissioning Flow”](#custom-commissioning-flow), 5^(th) bullet). Also, the query components as described in [Section 5.7.3.1, “CommissioningCustomFlowUrl format”](#commissioningcustomflowurl-format) can be added to the URL to improve the overall flow. For example, usage of MTop, MTcu and MTrop parameters would be useful to smooth the flow in case the manufacturer-provided mechanism uses a manufacturer-defined mechanism to get the device on the IP network, after which the original commissioner can take care of the Matter commissioning ("[device already on IP-network](#using-existing-ip-bearing-network)").
>
> An example of this flow is illustrated below. The "DCL info" concept denotes that the Commissioner SHALL collect the information from the DCL via some mechanism, such as a network resource accessible to the Commissioner containing a replicated set of the DCL’s content.

![](media/image41.png)

> *Figure 38. Commissioning Fallback Mechanism sequence diagram*
>
> In the flow above:

- In the final steps, the User might have to perform the trigger to the Commissioner, so that it can start or continue the commissioning process.

- If possible, a Commissioner MAY continue to scan for announcements from the device in the background while any manufacturer-specific app is configuring the device to be available for commissioning. The Commissioner might need a new OnboardingPayload provided to the User by the Manufacturer Website or App.

- In order to simplify the flow, the Commissioner MAY:

  - Include the onboarding payload obtained from the user (see [MTop key](#commissioningcustomflowurl-format)) within the Commission­ ingFallbackUrl.

  - Include a callback URL (see [MTcu key](#commissioningcustomflowurl-format)) within the ExpandedFallbackUrl.

- The Manufacturer Website or App MAY utilize the CallbackUrl field, if provided in the query string, in order to simplify the process for signaling the completion of the manufacturer-specific part of the flow back to the Commissioner. When doing so, the Manufacturer Website or App SHOULD put the device into Commissioning mode and SHOULD provide the corresponding onboarding payload to the Commissioner using the MTrop key/value pair within the [Expanded­](#callbackurl-format-for-custom-commissioning-flow-response) [CallbackUrl](#callbackurl-format-for-custom-commissioning-flow-response).

### Manual Pairing Code and QR Code Inclusion

> Manual Pairing Code and QR setup codes enable secure commissioning and provide a consistent experience that many users are familiar with. However, because they contain a symmetric security
>
> code it is not appropriate in all circumstances to have them be in a readily accessible location on the device, such as printed on the back.
>
> The following are the requirements and recommendations regarding the QR Code and Manual Pair­ ing code for Standard and User Intent Commissioning Flow Devices. Custom Commissioning Flow Device rules are described in the [Custom Commissioning Flow](#custom-commissioning-flow).
>
> The term 'on-device' allows for a physical label affixed to the device or printed directly on the device, as well as one that can be displayed on demand through some physical interface properties of the device (e.g. visual or audio).

1.  Devices SHALL include the Manual Pairing code on-device or in packaging.

2.  Devices SHALL NOT have the QR nor the manual pairing code in an unprotected format on the outer packaging.

3.  Devices SHOULD include the QR Code, and SHOULD include it alongside the Manual Pairing Code on-device or in packaging.

4.  Manual Pairing Code and QR Code on-device MAY be removable or obscured to allow the owner to prevent commissioning without their consent.

5.  Devices MAY include the QR Code and Manual Pairing Code in multiple forms (see below).

> Presentation of the QR Code and Manual Pairing code on-device can occur in many forms to allow for adherence to device security requirements and manufacturing considerations. For example security devices could limit the access to the QR code or Manual Pairing Code to avoid an unautho­ rized user obtaining the information by simple inspection, or make the QR code and/or Manual Pairing Code removable.
>
> The following is a list of possible ways that are acceptable to satisfy the requirements of inclusion of the QR code and Manual Pairing Code. An entry in the list should not be interpreted as being mutually exclusive with another entry. A device SHOULD include as many of these ways as possible.

- QR and Manual Pairing Code shown via an on-device display (when available)

- QR and Manual Pairing Code printed on-device, with removal/obscuring considerations noted above.

- Manual Pairing Code presented on-device via audio output (when available)

- QR and Manual Pairing Code printed on in-packaging materials.

> The following are examples of QR code and Manual Pairing Code inclusion.

- QR Code and Manual Pairing Code printed on a Matter wireless shade inside the battery com­ partment cover, and provided in the packaging.

- QR Code and Manual Pairing code on a Matter Smart Thermostat that can be activated via an on-device User Interface and displayed only on screen.

- QR Code and Manual Pairing code for a security sensor that is provided in the packaging, and on-device hidden behind a tamper-monitored cover.

- QR code provided on an E12 light bulb, with manual pairing code on a removable label (the area of QR code likely fits better on small form factor bulb than the area for a 13 character

> string).

- A wearable device with only a Manual Pairing Code printed on the fabric. No QR code is present because of the difficulty in scanning a QR code on an irregular surface.

- A Smart speaker, without printed QR or manual pairing code on the device (but possibly in- packaging), that can be triggered to read out a Manual Pairing Code.

## In-field Upgrade to Matter

> This (informative) section discusses the case of a pre-Matter device currently in the user’s home which gets software updated to support Matter, and which steps (either Matter-specified or manu­ facturer specific) would typically be applied to accomplish this goal.

- The initial situation is a device which is connected to the local network, and some manufacturer specific means (e.g. a manufacturer-provided app) is used to provide new firmware (including Matter functionality) to the device, along with the associated [Certification Declaration](#certification-declaration). Also, a unique [Device Attestation Certificate](#device-attestation-certificate-dac) is provided into the device using secure, manufacturer- specific means.

- The device restarts to enable the new firmware, and is now an uncommissioned Matter device.

- The device can be commissioned by any Commissioner; the [Onboarding Payload](#onboarding-payload-contents) needs to be provided to that Commissioner (since this information is not provided on or with the device out of the factory).

  - For this, similar mechanisms as discussed as in [Section 5.6.3, “Enhanced Commissioning](#enhanced-commissioning-method-ecm) [Method (ECM)”](#enhanced-commissioning-method-ecm) can be employed:

    - information equivalent to the parameters of the [Open Commissioning Window](#opencommissioningwindow-command) com­ mand is sent to the device using some secure manufacturer-defined means

    - presentation of the passcode and other relevant information can be performed using the mechanisms described in [Section 5.6.3.1, “Presentation of Onboarding Payload for ECM”](#presentation-of-onboarding-payload-for-ecm).

  - For devices with a means to output the [Onboarding Payload](#onboarding-payload-contents) themselves (e.g. device with a display or audio output), alternatively, similar mechanisms as discussed as in [Section 5.6.2,](#basic-commissioning-method-bcm) [“Basic Commissioning Method (BCM)”](#basic-commissioning-method-bcm) can be employed:

    - information equivalent to the parameters of the [Open Basic Commissioning Window](#openbasiccommissioningwindow-command) command is sent to the device using some secure manufacturer-defined means

    - the device itself presents [Onboarding Payload](#onboarding-payload-contents).

# Chapter 6. Device Attestation and Operational Credentials

> This chapter describes the procedures and cryptographic credentials involved in establishing trust between entities.
>
> The [Device Attestation](#device-attestation) section provides mechanisms for Commissioners and Administrators to determine whether a Node is a genuine certified product before sharing sensitive information such as keys and other credentials. The Device Attestation feature relies on a [Device Attestation Certifi­](#device-attestation-certificate-dac-1) [cate (DAC)](#device-attestation-certificate-dac-1) chain and on a [Certification Declaration (CD)](#certification-declaration-cd-format).
>
> The [Node Operational Credentials](#node-operational-credentials-specification) section describes the credentials used by all Nodes to mutually authenticate each other during [Certificate-Authenticated Session Establishment](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case), including the [Node](#node-operational-certificate-noc) [Operational Certificate (NOC)](#node-operational-certificate-noc) chain. These credentials form the basis of how Nodes are identified and take part in securing operational [unicast communication](#unicast-communication).

## Certificate Common Conventions

> This chapter makes use of digital certificates in several subsections. All certificates within this spec­ ification are based on X.509v3-compliant certificates as defined in [RFC 5280](#_bookmark54). The storage format of the certificates depends on application (e.g., DAC or NOC chain), but all certificates are directly com­ patible with X.509v3 DER representation after suitable loading or decompression.
>
> In order to simplify further exposition, this subsection contains some common normative conven­ tions that SHALL apply to all digital certificates described in this specification.
>
> The following certificate formats are defined within this specification:

- Compressed [Node Operational credentials](#node-operational-credentials-specification) certificate chain elements in [Matter Operational Cer­](#operational-certificate-encoding) [tificate Encoding](#operational-certificate-encoding) or "Matter Certificate" format:

  - Node Operational Certificate ([NOC](#node-operational-certificate-noc))

  - Intermediate CA Certificate ([ICAC](#intermediate-ca-ica-certificate))

  - Root CA Certificate ([RCAC](#trusted-root-ca-certificates))

- Device Attestation certificate chain elements in Standard X.509 DER format:

  - Device Attestation Certificate (DAC): see [Section 6.2.2.3, “Device Attestation Certificate (DAC)”](#device-attestation-certificate-dac-1)

  - Product Attestation Intermediate (PAI): see [Section 6.2.2.4, “Product Attestation Intermediate](#product-attestation-intermediate-pai-certificate) [(PAI) Certificate”](#product-attestation-intermediate-pai-certificate)

  - Product Attestation Authority (PAA): see [Section 6.2.2.5, “Product Attestation Authority (PAA)](#product-attestation-authority-paa-certificate) [Certificate”](#product-attestation-authority-paa-certificate)

### Encoding of Matter-specific RDNs

> In addition to the standard DN (Distinguished Names) attribute types that appear in certificate Sub­ ject and Issuer fields, there are Matter-specific DN attribute types under the [1.3.6.1.4.1.1.37244](#appendix-e-matter-specific-asn.1-object-identifiers-oids) pri­
>
> vate arc. These are listed in [Table 62, “Matter-specific DN Object Identifiers”](#_bookmark573). These OID values are assigned by the Connectivity Standards Alliance for use with Matter. All of these Matter-specific RDNs encode values normatively defined as scalars.
>
> When used in Matter Operational Certificate (TLV) format (see [Section 6.5, “Operational Certificate](#operational-certificate-encoding) [Encoding”](#operational-certificate-encoding)), Matter-specific DN attribute types SHALL be encoded in Matter TLV as unsigned inte­ gers with the specified length.
>
> When used in X.509 ASN.1 DER format certificate encoding, Matter-specific DN attribute types SHALL have their value encoded as either a UTF8String or PrintableString according to the table below. The values SHALL be encoded in network byte order as exactly twice their specified maxi­ mum octet length, encoded as uppercase hexadecimal number format without any separators or prefix, and without omitting any leading zeroes.
>
> For example:

- A scalar value 0x0123_4567_89AB_CDEF for matter-node-id:

&nbsp;

- Scalar maximal length: 8 octets (64 bits)

- Resulting string: "0123456789ABCDEF" (without quotes)

- Resulting length: 16 characters

&nbsp;

- A scalar value 0xAA_33CC for matter-noc-cat:

&nbsp;

- Scalar maximal length: 4 octets (32 bits)

- Resulting string: "00AA33CC" (without quotes)

- Resulting length: 8 characters

> *Table 62. Matter-specific DN Object Identifiers*

[TABLE]

[TABLE]

### Key Identifier Extension Constraints

> Whenever an X.509 certificate contains Authority Key Identifier or Subject Key Identifier exten­ sions, the associated Key Identifier SHALL be of a length of 20 octets, consistent with the length of derivation method (1) described in section 4.2.1.2 of \[[RFC 5280](#_bookmark54)\].
>
> Further constraints related to the exact derivation appear in the following subsections:

- Matter Certificates (NOC, ICAC, RCAC) Subject Key Identifier extension: see [Section 6.5.11.4,](#subject-key-identifier-extension) [“Subject Key Identifier Extension”](#subject-key-identifier-extension)

- Matter Certificates Authority Key Identifier extension: see [Section 6.5.11.5, “Authority Key Iden­](#authority-key-identifier-extension) [tifier Extension”](#authority-key-identifier-extension)

- Device Attestation Certificate (DAC) extensions: see [Section 6.2.2.3, “Device Attestation Certifi­](#device-attestation-certificate-dac-1) [cate (DAC)”](#device-attestation-certificate-dac-1)

- Product Attestation Intermediate (PAI) Certificate extensions: see [Section 6.2.2.4, “Product Attes­](#product-attestation-intermediate-pai-certificate) [tation Intermediate (PAI) Certificate”](#product-attestation-intermediate-pai-certificate)

- Product Attestation Authority (PAA) Certificate extensions: see [Section 6.2.2.5, “Product Attesta­](#product-attestation-authority-paa-certificate) [tion Authority (PAA) Certificate”](#product-attestation-authority-paa-certificate)

### Certificate Sizes

> All certificates SHALL NOT be longer than 600 bytes in their uncompressed DER format. This con­ straint SHALL apply to the entire DAC chain (DAC, PAI, PAA) and NOC chain (NOC, ICAC, RCAC).
>
> Wherever [Matter Operational Certificate Encoding](#operational-certificate-encoding) representation is used, all certificates SHALL NOT be longer than 400 bytes in their TLV form. This constraint only applies to the NOC chain (NOC, ICAC, RCAC) since the DAC chain (DAC, PAI, PAA) only appears in DER format.
>
> All certificates used within Matter SHOULD be as short as possible.

### Presentation of example certificates

> Certificate bodies are presented for exemplary purposes in multiple formats within this chapter. Since the translation of an X.509 certificate from ASN.1 DER format to human-readable text format may lose fidelity, especially with regards to equivalent types (e.g., PrintableString versus IA5String versus UTF8String) or serialization when non-standard OIDs are seen, textual examples SHALL NOT be considered to be normative. Only direct encoding of DER encoding, such as PEM blocks, should be used to further study the examples. In case of unforeseen divergence between an exam­ ple certificate illustration and the normative rules expressed in prose, the normative prose SHALL take precedence over an ambiguous interpretation of an example.

## Device Attestation

### Introduction

> Certification of a Device includes configuring the Device with immutable credentials that can be cryptographically verified. Device Attestation is the step of the [Commissioning](#commissioning-flows) process whereby a Commissioner cryptographically verifies a Commissionee is in fact a certified Device. This chapter describes the Device Attestation Certificate (DAC) and the systems involved in the verification of a DAC.
>
> The processes used to convey the DAC from a Commissionee to a Commissioner, how to verify that a Commissionee holds the private key corresponding to its DAC, and specifically how the DAC is ver­ ified are described in [Section 6.2.3, “Device Attestation Procedure”](#device-attestation-procedure).
>
> This chapter refers to the signature algorithm ECDSA with SHA256 and to the elliptic curve secp256r1 (a.k.a. prime256v1 and NIST P-256) in compliance with the mapping for [version 1.0](#_bookmark222) of the [Matter Mes­](#message-frame-format) [sage Format](#message-frame-format) of the cryptographic primitives as specified in [Chapter 3,](#chapter-3.-cryptographic-primitives) [*Cryptographic Primitives*](#chapter-3.-cryptographic-primitives). Future versions of this specification might adapt these references accordingly.

### Device Attestation Certificate (DAC)

> All commissionable Matter Nodes SHALL include a Device Attestation Certificate (DAC) and corre­ sponding private key, unique to that Device. The DAC is used in the Device Attestation process, as part of Commissioning a Commissionee into a Fabric. The DAC SHALL be a DER-encoded X.509v3- compliant certificate as defined in [RFC 5280](#_bookmark54) and SHALL be issued by a Product Attestation Interme­ diate (PAI) that chains directly to an approved Product Attestation Authority (PAA), and therefore SHALL have a certification path length of 2.
>
> The DAC also SHALL contain specific values of Vendor ID and Product ID (see [Section 6.2.2.2,](#encoding-of-vendor-id-and-product-id-in-subject-and-issuer-fields) [“Encoding of Vendor ID and Product ID in subject and issuer fields”](#encoding-of-vendor-id-and-product-id-in-subject-and-issuer-fields)) in its subject field to indicate the [Vendor ID](#vendor-identifier-vendor-id-vid) and [Product ID](#product-identifier-product-id-pid) provenance of the attestation certificate. See [Section 6.2.3.1, “Attesta­](#attestation-information-validation) [tion Information Validation”](#attestation-information-validation) for how these are used.
>
> The validity period of a DAC is determined by the vendor and MAY be set to the maximum allowed value of 99991231235959Z GeneralizedTime to indicate that the DAC has no well-defined expiration date.
>
> The notation used in this section to describe the specifics of the DAC uses the ASN.1 basic notation as defined in [X.680](#_bookmark86). The notation below also leverages types defined in [RFC 5280](#_bookmark54) such as Algorith­ mIdentifier, RelativeDistinguishedName, Validity, Time, UTCTime, GeneralizedTime, or permitted exten­ sion types. Additionally, the notation below uses the ASN.1 definitions captured in the figure below:

#### Device Attestation Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

> The Device Attestation PKI hierarchy consists of the PAA, PAI and individual DAC. The public key from the associated [PAI certificate](#product-attestation-intermediate-pai-certificate) is used to cryptographically verify the DAC signature. The PAI certificate in turn is signed and attested to by the Product Attestation Authority (PAA) CA. The pub­ lic key from the associated PAA certificate is used to cryptographically verify the PAI certificate sig­ nature. The PAA certificate is an implicitly trusted self-signed root certificate. In this way, the DAC chains up to the PAI certificate, which in turn chains up to the PAA root certificate. A PAI SHALL be assigned to a [Vendor ID](#encoding-of-vendor-id-and-product-id-in-subject-and-issuer-fields) value. A PAI MAY further be scoped to a single [ProductID](#encoding-of-vendor-id-and-product-id-in-subject-and-issuer-fields) value. If a PAI is used for multiple products, then it cannot be scoped to a ProductID value, otherwise the [Device](#device-attestation-procedure) [Attestation Procedure](#device-attestation-procedure) will fail policy validations.
>
> Commissioners SHALL use PAA and PAI certificates to verify the authenticity of a Commissionee before proceeding with the rest of the Commissioning flow.
>
> The subject of all DAC and PAI certificates SHALL be unique among all those issued by their issuer, as intended by [RFC 5280](#_bookmark54) section 4.1.2.6, through the use of RelativeDistinguishedName s that ensure the uniqueness, such as for example a unique combination of commonName (OID 2.5.4.3), serialNumber (OID 2.5.4.5), organizationalUnitName (OID 2.5.4.11), etc. The exact additional constraints, including for the subject field, for PAA, PAI and DAC certificates, are presented in the following subsections.
>
> The following figure shows the Device Attestation PKI hierarchy.

#### Encoding of Vendor ID and Product ID in subject and issuer fields

> The following subsections contain references to [VendorID](#vendor-identifier-vendor-id-vid) and [ProductID](#product-identifier-product-id-pid):

- [Section 6.2.2.3, “Device Attestation Certificate (DAC)”](#device-attestation-certificate-dac-1)

- [Section 6.2.2.4, “Product Attestation Intermediate (PAI) Certificate”](#product-attestation-intermediate-pai-certificate)

- [Section 6.2.2.5, “Product Attestation Authority (PAA) Certificate”](#product-attestation-authority-paa-certificate)

> The values for VendorID and ProductID, where possible or required in issuer or subject fields SHALL be encoded by only one of two methods, without mixing the methods within a given field:

1.  The "preferred method", using Matter-specific RelativeDistinguishedName attributes:

    1.  VendorID encoded as AttributeTypeAndValue entry with type equal to [1.3.6.1.4.1.37244.2.1](#_bookmark2008), and value respecting encoding specified in [Section 6.1.1, “Encoding of Matter-specific RDNs”](#encoding-of-matter-specific-rdns).

    2.  ProductID encoded as AttributeTypeAndValue entry with type equal to [1.3.6.1.4.1.37244.2.2](#_bookmark2009), and value respecting encoding specified in [Section 6.1.1, “Encoding of Matter-specific RDNs”](#encoding-of-matter-specific-rdns).

2.  A "fallback method" to support certificate authorities that only allow customary [RFC 5280](#_bookmark54) OIDs in the arc {joint-iso-itu-t(2) ds(5) attributeType(4)} for type values in AttributeTypeAndValue entries of RelativeDistinguishedName elements is to encode them as substrings within the com­ monName attribute type ({joint-iso-itu-t(2) ds(5) attributeType(4) commonName(3)}):

    1.  VendorID value encoded with substring Mvid: followed by exactly 4 uppercase hexadecimal characters without elision of leading zeroes, anywhere within the commonName, such as for example:

        1.  VendorID 0xFFF1 (65521 decimal): Mvid:FFF1

        2.  VendorID 0x2A (42 decimal): Mvid:002A

    2.  ProductID value encoded with substring Mpid: followed by exactly 4 uppercase hexadecimal characters without elision of leading zeroes, anywhere within the commonName, such as for example:

        1.  ProductID 0xC20A (49674 decimal): Mpid:C20A

        2.  ProductID 0x3A5 (933 decimal): Mpid:03A5

    3.  For both VendorID and ProductID, the following additional rules apply to the "fallback method":

        1.  The leftmost match having a correct encoding SHALL be used, with other correct matches discarded.

        2.  For either of VendorID and ProductID, if the prefix string is found on its own anywhere within the commonName, but there is no fully correct match anywhere in the commonName, the field SHALL be considered incorrectly formatted.

> The "preferred method" leaves more space for content in the commonName attribute type if present. It is also less ambiguous which may allow simpler processing of certificate issuance policy validations in CAs that support the Matter-specific RelativeDistinguishedName attributes, and simplify the audit of certificates where Vendor ID and Product ID appear.
>
> The "fallback method" is present to support less flexible CA infrastructure.
>
> **Fallback method to encode VendorID and ProductID**
>
> The "fallback method" requires exactly 9 characters that are safe to use in both PrintableString and UTF8String for either VendorID or ProductID encoding. Since these VendorID and ProductID sub­ strings have unambiguous format, they MAY be provided anywhere within a commonName value, and therefore separator selection does not need to be considered. Note that the standard [RFC 5280](#_bookmark54) length limitation for commonName attribute value is 64 characters in total (see ub-common-name in [RFC 5280](#_bookmark54)).
>
> Using the "fallback method" for embedding of VendorID and ProductID in commonName in the subject field of a [Device Attestation Certificate](#device-attestation-certificate-dac-1) claiming VendorID 0xFFF1 and ProductID 0x00B1 can be illustrated with the following valid and invalid examples (without the double quotes):

- "ACME Matter Devel DAC 5CDA9899 Mvid:FFF1 Mpid:00B1": valid and recommended since easily human-readable

- "ACME Matter Devel DAC 5CDA9899 Mpid:00B1 Mvid:FFF1": valid and recommended since easily human-readable

- "Mpid:00B1,ACME Matter Devel DAC 5CDA9899,Mvid:FFF1": valid example showing that order or separators are not considered at all for the overall validity of the embedded fields

- "ACME Matter Devel DAC 5CDA9899 Mvid:FFF1Mpid:00B1": valid, but less readable

- "Mvid:FFF1ACME Matter Devel DAC 5CDAMpid:00B19899": valid, but highly discouraged, since embedding of substrings within other substrings may be confusing to human readers.

- "ACME Matter Devel DAC 5CDA9899 Mvid:FF1 Mpid:00B1": invalid, since substring following Mvid: is not exactly 4 uppercase hexadecimal digits

- "ACME Matter Devel DAC 5CDA9899 Mvid:fff1 Mpid:00B1": invalid, since substring following Mvid:

> is not exactly 4 uppercase hexadecimal digits

- "ACME Matter Devel DAC 5CDA9899 Mvid:FFF1 Mpid:B1": invalid, since substring following Mpid: is not exactly 4 uppercase hexadecimal digits

- "ACME Matter Devel DAC 5CDA9899 Mpid: Mvid:FFF1": invalid, since the prefix Mpid: was found but there is no occurrence of Mpid: followed by exactly 4 uppercase hexadecimal digits.

> In addition, the following example shows a highly discouraged, though technically valid encoding:

- "Mpid:Mvid:FFF1 Mpid:12cd Matter Test Mpid:FE67": VendorID 0xFFF1 and ProductID 0xFE67 (leftmost match is the correct match for Mpid: prefix).

  - Instances such as this example SHOULD be avoided since they can cause confusion in differ­ ent implementations, even if the rules are obeyed.

> If either the Vendor ID ([1.3.6.1.4.1.37244.2.1](#_bookmark2008)) or Product ID ([1.3.6.1.4.1.37244.2.2](#_bookmark2009)) Matter-specific OIDs appear in any RelativeDistinguishedName in the subject or issuer fields of a certificate which is part of the Device Attestation Certificate chain path, then that certificate within the chain SHALL NOT have its commonName, if present, parsed for the "fallback method", in the rest of the issuer or sub­ ject field where the Matter-specific OIDs appear. In other words, considering a field such as subject or issuer, the presence of either of these OIDs as the type for any AttributeTypeAndValue within any RelativeDistinguishedName of that field SHALL cause the "fallback method" to be skipped altogether for that field. Otherwise, when the "fallback method" can legally be used, it SHALL only be used
>
> against AttributeTypeAndValue sequences where the type field is commonName ({joint-iso-itu-t(2) ds(5) attributeType(4) commonName(3)}) in the issuer and subject fields, and any mention thereafter of using or matching a "Vendor ID" or "Product ID" with regards to a [Device Attestation Procedure](#device-attestation-procedure) step SHALL rely on values obtained with that method.
>
> For example, if a given [Product Attestation Intermediate certificate](#product-attestation-intermediate-pai-certificate) has a subject field employing a particular method of encoding the VendorID and ProductID, either using only Matter-specific OIDs or only the fallback method, then it follows that a [Device Attestation Certificates](#device-attestation-certificate-dac-1) issued by the cer­ tificate authority of that Product Attestation Intermediate SHALL have the same Distinguished­ Name content in its issuer field, so that the basic path validation algorithm works. That Device Attestation Certificate MAY however have the "fallback method" used within its subject field, if the Product Attestation Intermediate certificate authority is unable to encode/reflect the Matter-specific OIDs in RelativeDistinguishedName attributes within the subject field. The rules for whether to consider the canonical or "fallback method" for VendorID and ProductID encoding applies field by field independently for each instance of subject or issuer field found in certificates within the DAC chain.

### Device Attestation Procedure

> The device attestation procedure SHALL be executed by Commissioners when commissioning a device. It serves to validate whether a particular device is certified for Matter compliance and that it was legitimately produced by the certified manufacturer. See [Section 5.5, “Commissioning Flows”](#commissioning-flows) for the possible outcomes based on whether the Device Attestation Procedure succeeds or fails to attest the device.
>
> The Device Attestation Certificate Chain MAY be read at any time, either prior to or after receipt of the [AttestationResponse](#attestationresponse-command). The Commissionee SHALL make the Certificate Chain available whenever requested using [CertificateChainRequest](#certificatechainrequest-command). If the Commissioner does not already have this informa­ tion, to proceed with the validation, it SHALL request the Commissionee’s Device Attestation Certifi­ cate Chain using [CertificateChainRequest](#certificatechainrequest-command).
>
> The procedure is as follows:

1.  The Commissioner SHALL generate a random 32 byte attestation nonce using [Crypto_DRBG()](#deterministic-random-bit-generator-drbg).

2.  The Commissioner SHALL send the AttestationNonce to the Commissionee and request Attesta­ tion Information using [AttestationRequest](#attestationrequest-command).

3.  The Commissionee SHALL return the signed [Attestation Information](#attestation-information) to the Commissioner using [AttestationResponse](#attestationresponse-command).

> After execution of the procedure, the Attestation Information SHOULD be validated using the checks described in [Section 6.2.3.1, “Attestation Information Validation”](#attestation-information-validation).

#### Attestation Information Validation

> A Commissioner validating the Attestation Information SHOULD record sufficient information to provide detailed results of the validation outcome to users. Therefore, prior to validating Attesta­ tion Information, a Commissioner SHOULD have previously obtained the Device Attestation Certifi­ cate chain for the Commissionee, so that the DAC and PAI necessary for the procedure are available.
>
> In order to consider a Commissionee successfully attested, a Commissioner SHALL have success­ fully validated at least the following:

- The PAA SHALL be validated for presence in the Commissioner’s trusted root store, which SHOULD include at least the set of globally trusted PAA certificates present in the [Distributed](#distributed-compliance-ledger) [Compliance Ledger](#distributed-compliance-ledger) at the issuing timestamp (notBefore) of the DAC.

- The DAC certificate chain SHALL be validated using the [Crypto_VerifyChainDER()](#certificate-validation) function, tak­ ing into account the mandatory presence of the PAI and of the PAA. It is especially important to ensure the entire chain has a length of exactly 3 elements (PAA certificate, PAI certificate, Device Attestation Certificate) and that the necessary format policies previously exposed are validated, to avoid unauthorized path chaining (e.g., through multiple PAI certificates).

  - Chain validation SHALL be performed with respect to the notBefore timestamp of the DAC to ensure that the DAC was valid when it was issued. This way of validating is abided by the [Crypto_VerifyChainDER()](#certificate-validation) function.

  - Chain validation SHALL include revocation checks of the DAC and PAI, based on the Com­ missioner’s best understanding of revoked entities. See [Section 6.2.4, “Device attestation](#device-attestation-revocation) [revocation”](#device-attestation-revocation) for an interoperable method of obtaining revocation information in the Device Attestation PKI.

- The [VendorID](#encoding-of-vendor-id-and-product-id-in-subject-and-issuer-fields) value found in the subject DN of the DAC SHALL match the [VendorID](#encoding-of-vendor-id-and-product-id-in-subject-and-issuer-fields) value in the subject DN of the PAI certificate.

- If the PAA certificate contains a [VendorID](#encoding-of-vendor-id-and-product-id-in-subject-and-issuer-fields) value in its subject DN, its value SHALL match the [VendorID](#encoding-of-vendor-id-and-product-id-in-subject-and-issuer-fields) value in the subject DN of the PAI certificate.

- The Device Attestation Signature ([attestation_signature](#attestation-information)) field from [Attestation Response](#attestationresponse-command) SHALL be validated:

> where the fields are encoded as described in [Section 11.18.4.7, “Attestation Information”](#attestation-information).

- The AttestationChallenge SHALL be obtained from a [CASE session](#_bookmark389), [resumed CASE session](#_bookmark390), or [PASE session](#_bookmark363) depending on the method used to establish the secure session within which device attestation is conducted.

&nbsp;

- The AttestationNonce in [Device Attestation elements](#attestation-elements) SHALL match the Commissioner’s pro­ vided AttestationNonce.

- The Certification Declaration signature SHALL be validated using the [Crypto_Verify()](#_bookmark161) function and the public key obtained from the CSA’s Certificate Authority Certificate.

- The [Certification Declaration](#certification-declaration-cd-format) SHALL be validated:

  - The vendor_id field in the [Certification Declaration](#certification-declaration-cd-format) SHALL match the [VendorID attribute](#vendorid-attribute) found in the Basic Information cluster.

  - The product_id_array field in the [Certification Declaration](#certification-declaration-cd-format) SHALL contain the value of the [ProductID attribute](#productid-attribute) found in the Basic Information cluster.

  - The Certification Declaration SHALL be considered valid only if it contains both or neither of the dac_origin_vendor_id and dac_origin_product_id fields.

  - If the Certification Declaration has both the dac_origin_vendor_id and the dac_origin_produc­ t_id fields, the following validation SHALL be done:

    - The [VendorID](#encoding-of-vendor-id-and-product-id-in-subject-and-issuer-fields) value from the subject DN in the DAC SHALL match the dac_origin_ven­ dor_id field in the [Certification Declaration](#certification-declaration-cd-format).

    - The [VendorID](#encoding-of-vendor-id-and-product-id-in-subject-and-issuer-fields) value from the subject DN in the PAI SHALL match the dac_origin_ven­ dor_id field in the [Certification Declaration](#certification-declaration-cd-format).

    - The [ProductID](#encoding-of-vendor-id-and-product-id-in-subject-and-issuer-fields) value from the subject DN in the DAC SHALL match the dac_origin_pro­ duct_id field in the [Certification Declaration](#certification-declaration-cd-format).

    - The [ProductID](#encoding-of-vendor-id-and-product-id-in-subject-and-issuer-fields) value from the subject DN in the PAI, if such a ProductID value appears, SHALL match the dac_origin_product_id field in the [Certification Declaration](#certification-declaration-cd-format).

  - If the Certification Declaration has neither the dac_origin_vendor_id nor the dac_origin_pro­ duct_id fields, the following validation SHALL be done:

    - The [VendorID](#encoding-of-vendor-id-and-product-id-in-subject-and-issuer-fields) value from the subject DN in the DAC SHALL match the vendor_id field in the [Certification Declaration](#certification-declaration-cd-format).

    - The [VendorID](#encoding-of-vendor-id-and-product-id-in-subject-and-issuer-fields) value from the subject DN in the PAI SHALL match the vendor_id field in the [Certification Declaration](#certification-declaration-cd-format).

    - The [ProductID](#encoding-of-vendor-id-and-product-id-in-subject-and-issuer-fields) value from the subject DN in the DAC SHALL be present in the produc­ t_id_array field in the [Certification Declaration](#certification-declaration-cd-format).

    - The [ProductID](#encoding-of-vendor-id-and-product-id-in-subject-and-issuer-fields) value from the subject DN in the PAI, if such a Product ID is present, SHALL match one of the values present in the product_id_array field in the [Certification](#certification-declaration-cd-format) [Declaration](#certification-declaration-cd-format).

&nbsp;

- If the Certification Declaration contains the authorized_paa_list field, the following valida­ tion SHALL be done:

  - The Subject Key Identifier (SKI) extension value of the PAA certificate, which is the root of trust of the DAC, SHALL be present as one of the values in the authorized_paa_list field.

- The certificate_id field SHOULD match the CDCertificateID field found in the entry of the [DeviceSoftwareCompliance](#devicesoftwarecompliance-compliance-test-result-schema) schema in the [Distributed Compliance Ledger](#distributed-compliance-ledger) where the entry’s VendorID, ProductID and SoftwareVersion field match the respective [VendorID](#vendorid-attribute), [ProductID](#productid-attribute) and [SoftwareVersion](#softwareversion-attribute) attributes values found in the [Basic Information Cluster](#basic-information-cluster). For further clarity, a scenario where a mismatch is most likely to occur is with devices that have received an updated firmware but not an updated CD. Also, the Commissioner might not find the combi­ nation of VendorID, ProductID and SoftwareVersion fields in the DCL information it has avail­ able.

  - Since it is possible certificate_id does not match the CDCertificateID field due to the above point, a Commissioner SHOULD NOT reject the Commissionee solely because of this mismatch. Instead, the Commissioner SHOULD separately check that the reported [SoftwareVersion](#softwareversion-attribute) in the [Basic Information Cluster](#basic-information-cluster) exists as a [DeviceSoftwareVersion­](#devicesoftwareversionmodel-schema) [Model](#devicesoftwareversionmodel-schema) in the [Distributed Compliance Ledger](#distributed-compliance-ledger) to see if the current version is certified. For the case of offline commissioning without access to DCL, the Commissioner SHOULD pro­ ceed trusting that a valid CD matching the reported [VendorID](#vendorid-attribute) and [ProductID](#productid-attribute) at least ensures the device has been previously certified and SHOULD check the DCL at a later time to ensure the current SoftwareVersion is also certified.

- The firmware_information field in the [Attestation Information](#attestation-information), if present, SHALL match the content of an entry in the [Distributed Compliance Ledger](#distributed-compliance-ledger) for the specific device as explained in [Section 6.3.2, “Firmware Information”](#firmware-information). If the Commissioner does not support Firmware Information validation, it MAY skip checking this match.

> The order of execution of the above validation steps MAY be optimized by Commissioners. For example, if some validation steps are deemed by a Commissioner to make the remainder of the steps unnecessary because they have no chance of succeeding, then the validation steps could be ordered such that superfluous steps or rounds trips are omitted.

### Device attestation revocation

> The [Distributed Compliance Ledger](#distributed-compliance-ledger) contains a trusted list of revocation distribution points for the Device Attestation PKI. The schema is documented in [Section 11.23.9, “Device Attestation PKI Revo­](#device-attestation-pki-revocation-distribution-points-schema) [cation Distribution Points Schema”](#device-attestation-pki-revocation-distribution-points-schema).
>
> The format of certificates in the Device Attestation PKI is constrained to maximum sizes and a spe­ cific format to reduce the complexity and system requirements for Device and Commissioner implementations. Therefore, there are no requirements for common revocation information, such as cRLDistributionPoints (see [RFC 5280](#_bookmark54) section 4.2.1.13) to be included. Furthermore, OCSP (see [RFC 6960](#_bookmark65)) is not used in order to allow Commissioner implementations which rely on previously cached revocation information, or which do not have concurrent access both to the public Internet and to the Commissionee when commissioning. The [Device Attestation PKI Revocation Distribution](#device-attestation-pki-revocation-distribution-points-schema) [Points Schema](#device-attestation-pki-revocation-distribution-points-schema) in the Distributed Compliance Ledger is thus the main method of delivering interop­ erable and universally accessible revocation information for Matter Commissioners and Adminis­
>
> trators.
>
> The revocation information MAY be partitioned over multiple [Device Attestation PKI Revocation](#device-attestation-pki-revocation-distribution-points-schema) [Distribution Points Schema](#device-attestation-pki-revocation-distribution-points-schema) entries, as the provider of such information deems fit. In other words, there may be more than one record to consult to determine revocation status of a given certificate.
>
> If a DAC, PAI or PAA certificate contains the cRLDistributionPoints (see [RFC 5280](#_bookmark54) section 4.2.1.13) extension, it SHALL be ignored, since the [Device Attestation PKI Revocation Distribution Points](#device-attestation-pki-revocation-distribution-points-schema) [Schema](#device-attestation-pki-revocation-distribution-points-schema) in the Distributed Compliance Ledger is the only supported method of determining up-to- date revocation status.

#### Conceptual algorithm for revocation set construction

> To build the list of revoked entities for a given PAI or PAA certificate authority, the table described in the [Device Attestation PKI Revocation Distribution Points Schema](#device-attestation-pki-revocation-distribution-points-schema) can be used with a conceptual algorithm, which can then be used at time of revocation checks.
>
> To build an oracle of revoked entities, the conceptual algorithm is as follows:

- Inputs:

  - List of all entries in the [Device Attestation PKI Revocation Distribution Points](#device-attestation-pki-revocation-distribution-points-schema) table of the Distributed Compliance Ledger.

- Outputs:

  - For each tuple of (CertificateAuthorityKeyIdentifier, CertificateAuthorityName), a set of RevokedEntitySerialNumber and an associated tuple of (CRLSignerCertificate, CRLSignerDele­ gator) certificates.

    - CertificateAuthorityKeyIdentifier is the Subject Key Identifier of a PAA or PAI as an octet string (e.g. ASN.1 OCTET STRING, or protobuf bytes).

    - CertificateAuthorityName is the X.500 Name associated with the PAA or PAI whose revo­ cation information is being aggregated, as it appears in the Issuer field of a certificate it issues.

    - RevokedEntitySerialNumber is a serial number containing a large integer matchable to an ASN.1 INTEGER as seen in the CertificateSerialNumber field of an [RFC 5280](#_bookmark54)-compliant cer­ tificate.

    - CRLSignerCertificate is the certificate present in the CRLSignerCertificate field from the Device Attestation PKI Revocation Distribution Points table entry processed.

    - CRLSignerDelegator is the certificate present in the CRLSignerDelegator field from the Device Attestation PKI Revocation Distribution Points table entry processed, if present.

#### NOTE

> While the algorithm here does not mention the recording of any other metadata per revoked entity to simplify illustration, implementers MAY do so to allow richer diag­ nostics information to be provided to end-users if a revoked entity is found.

- Algorithm:

  - For each entry in the [Device Attestation PKI Revocation Distribution Points](#device-attestation-pki-revocation-distribution-points-schema)

1.  If entry.RevocationType is not equal to 1 (not of type [RFC 5280](#_bookmark54) CRL), stop further process­ ing of the entry, and continue to next entry, as it is a format not defined in this Specifica­ tion.

2.  Parse the certificate found entry.CRLSignerCertificate from its PEM encoding, keeping it as CRLSignerCertificate.

3.  If entry.IsPAA is TRUE:

    1.  If CRLSignerCertificate encoded a VendorID, validate that it matches entry.VendorID. In case of mismatch, stop further processing of the entry, and continue to next entry, if any.

4.  Else if entry.IsPAA is FALSE:

    1.  If the CRLSignerCertificate is a PAI certificate (rather than a PAI-delegated certifi­ cate), validate that the CRLSignerCertificate 's VendorID, matches entry.VendorID. Else validate that the 'CRLSignerDelegator' 's VendorID, matches entry.VendorID. In case of mismatch, stop further processing of the entry, and continue to next entry, if any.

    2.  If the CRLSignerCertificate is a PAI certificate (rather than a PAI-delegated certifi­ cate), validate that the CRLSignerCertificate 's ProductID matches entry.ProductID, if present in the certificate’s subject. Else, validate that the 'CRLSignerDelegator' 's Pro­ ductID matches entry.ProductID, if present in the certificate’s subject. In case of mis­ match, stop further processing of the entry, and continue to next entry, if any.

5.  Validate the certification path containing CRLSignerCertificate and 'CRLSignerDelegator' (when present), using the approved PAAs currently in force in the Distributed Compli­ ance Ledger as the trust anchors. In case of failure, stop further processing of the entry, and continue to next entry, if any.

6.  Obtain the CRL at entry.DataUrl, keeping it as CRLFile.

7.  Perform CRLFile validation:

    1.  Validate that the crlExtensions field of CRLFile has an Authority Key Identifier extension matching the CRLSignerCertificate 's Subject Key Identifier. In case of mismatch, stop further processing of the entry, and continue to next entry, if any.

    2.  If more than one entry exists in the Distributed Compliance Ledger where the

> entry.VendorID and entry.IssuerSubjectKeyID are matching, then:

1.  Validate that the CRLFile has the Issuing Distribution Point critical CRL extension present (see [RFC 5280](#_bookmark54) section 5.2.5), and then:

    1.  Validate that the distributionPoint field of the extension has a single General­ Name of type uniformResourceIdentifier.

    2.  Validate that the uniformResourceIdentifier in the GeneralName field matches exactly, byte-for-byte, the value found in the entry.DataUrl field.

&nbsp;

3.  If any of above validations fail, stop further processing of the entry, and continue to next entry, if any.

&nbsp;

8.  Validate the CRL according to Section 6.3 of [RFC 5280](#_bookmark54), using the certificate specified in

CRLSignerCertificate as the trust anchor. Delta CRLs are not supported, so the "use-

> deltas" input variable SHALL be false. Note that since the conceptual algorithm in this section constructs a revocation set in advance without access to the candidate certificate, validations from Section 6.3 of [RFC 5280](#_bookmark54) SHALL be adapted by the implementer, and implementations MAY use any algorithm that conforms to the algorithm equivalence clause of Section 6.3. In case of failure, stop further processing of the entry, and continue to next entry, if any.

9.  If entry.IsPAA is true and entry.CRLSignerCertificate is not self-signed, then assign the subject field of the PAA Certificate that signed entry.CRLSignerCertificate to Certifi­ cateAuthorityName. Otherwise, if entry.CRLSignerDelegator is present and non-empty, then assign its subject field to CertificateAuthorityName. Otherwise assign the subject field of entry.CRLSignerCertificate to CertificateAuthorityName. In each case, similarly assign the value of the corresponding subject key identifier extension to CertificateAu­ thorityKeyIdentifier. The latter value should match entry.IssuerSubjectKeyID\`. In case of mismatch, stop further processing of the entry, and continue to next entry, if any.

10. For each entry in the CRLFile 's CertificateList.tbsCertList.revokedCertificates

> sequence:

1.  If the entry in revokedCertificates has the certificateIssuer entry extension (or if that extension appears in a previous entry in the sequence but also applies to this entry as specified in section 5.3.3 of [RFC 5280](#_bookmark54)) and the CertificateAuthorityName vari­ able does not match the distinguished name found in the certificateIssuer exten­ sion, ignore this entry.

2.  Access the correct revocation set by the tuple of (CertificateAuthorityKeyIdentifier, CertificateAuthorityName). If the set is missing, create it and assign the (CRLSignerCer­ tificate, CRLSignerDelegator) tuple with the set.

3.  Set the RevokedEntitySerialNumber to the revoked certificate’s userCertificate field (which is a serial number).

4.  Insert the RevokedEntitySerialNumber entry in the revocation set found earlier.

    - Optionally record metadata to record when each revocation distribution point requires an update.

> After execution of this algorithm, an oracle exists which MAY then be used to determine the revoca­ tion of any PAI or DAC certificate.

#### Determining Revocation Status of an Entity

> During the device attestation procedure, a Commissioner SHALL use a revocation set it maintains to determine whether the PAI and DAC certificates are revoked, unless the Commissioner does not have access to the revocation set due to a transient lack of access to necessary resources it uses to maintain the revocation set. If the revocation set was unavailable, the Commissioner SHOULD notify the user of the fact that commissioning could succeed for some non-genuine devices, due to lack of access to some of the necessary information.
>
> If the revocation set is available but no updated CRL is available beyond the timestamp in the "nex­ tUpdate" field in the PAI or the PAA CRL, the Commissioner MAY assume that no updated revoca­ tion information is being provided by the CA. The Commissioner SHOULD notify the user of the fact that commissioning could succeed for some non-genuine devices, due to lack of access to some of
>
> the necessary information.
>
> The revocation set SHOULD at least include the [Device Attestation PKI Revocation Distribution](#device-attestation-pki-revocation-distribution-points-schema) [Points Schema](#device-attestation-pki-revocation-distribution-points-schema) of the [Distributed Compliance Ledger](#distributed-compliance-ledger).
>
> Since there may be multiple formats for revocation information developed over time, the algorithm in this section is purposefully described in generic terms that would allow expansion to future for­ mats.
>
> The following conceptual algorithm is an example of how to determine whether a DAC or PAI cer­ tificate is "revoked" or "not revoked":

- Inputs:

  - The AuthorityKeyIdentifier extension of the certificate being queried.

  - The issuer name field of the certificate being queried.

  - The serialNumber field of the certificate being queried.

  - A conceptual RevocationDataSet indexed by (CertificateAuthorityKeyIdentifier, Certifi­ cateAuthorityName), yielding a set of RevokedEntitySerialNumber, and an associated tuple of (CRLSignerCertificate, CRLSignerDelegator) values.

    - CertificateAuthorityKeyIdentifier is the Subject Key Identifier of a PAA or PAI as an octet string (e.g. ASN.1 OCTET STRING, or protobuf bytes).

    - CertificateAuthorityName is the X.500 Name associated with the PAA or PAI whose revo­ cation information is being looked-up.

    - RevokedEntitySerialNumber is a serial number containing as an ASN.1 INTEGER as seen in the CertificateSerialNumber field of an [RFC 5280](#_bookmark54)-conformant certificate.

    - CRLSignerCertificate is the certificate that signed the CRL.

    - CRLSignerDelegator if present, is the certificate that signed the CRLSignerCertificate.

    - See [Section 6.2.4.1, “Conceptual algorithm for revocation set construction”](#conceptual-algorithm-for-revocation-set-construction) for a usable method to generate this dataset.

- Outputs:

  - A boolean value IsRevoked, where true indicates that the entity is revoked, and false indi­ cates that it is not revoked.

- Algorithm:

1.  Initialize IsRevoked to FALSE.

2.  Obtain the correct RevocationSet by indexing the RevocationDataSet by the AuthorityKeyIden­ tifier and issuer of the certificate whose status is being determined.

3.  If no matching RevocationSet is found, return immediately.

4.  If a matching RevocationSet is found, determined if serialNumber is a member of the set.

    1.  If the entity type whose revocation status is being verified is a PAI, then the subject PAI’s issuer (a PAA) SHALL fulfill one of the following two cases, otherwise return immedi­ ately:

        1.  The Subject and Subject Key of the PAI certificate’s issuer matches exactly the CRL­ SignerCertificate’s subject (i.e. the CRLSignerCertificate is a PAA).

        2.  The Subject and Subject Key of the PAI certificate’s issuer matches exactly the PAA which is the issuer of the CRLSignerCertificate (i.e. the CRLSignerCertificate is a CRL signer delegated by a PAA).

    2.  If the entity type whose revocation status is being verified is a DAC, then:

        1.  If the CRLSignerDelegator is present, then the subject DAC’s issuer (a PAI) SHALL match the CRLSignerDelegator in both Subject Key and Subject, otherwise return immediately.

        2.  If the CRLSignerDelegator is absent, then the subject DAC’s issuer (a PAI) SHALL match the CRLSignerCertificate in both Subject Key and Subject, otherwise return immedi­ ately.

    3.  If the serialNumber is part of the set, set IsRevoked to TRUE.

> The certificate in question is deemed revoked if IsRevoked was TRUE after execution of the above algorithm.

## Certification Declaration

> A Certification Declaration (CD) is a cryptographic document that allows a Matter device to assert its protocol compliance. It is encoded in a CMS format described in [RFC 5652](#_bookmark56). Upon successful com­ pletion of certification by a device type, Connectivity Standards Alliance creates the CD for that device type so that it can be included in the device firmware by the manufacturer.

### Certification Declaration (CD) Format

> The Certification Declaration is a [CMS](#_bookmark56)-encoded SignedData payload (see [RFC 5652](#_bookmark56) section 5) whose EncapsulatedContentInfo eContent field contains a TLV-encoded [certification-elements](#_bookmark593) structure with an anonymous tag:
>
> *Certification Elements TLV structure*

[TABLE]

[TABLE]

> The Certification Elements TLV is encoded with data to form a cd_content message to be signed.

[TABLE]

> The format_version field SHALL contain the value 1.
>
> The vendor_id field SHALL contain the [Vendor ID](#vendor-identifier-vendor-id-vid) associated with the Certification Declaration.
>
> The product_id_array field SHALL contain an array of a number of [Product IDs](#product-identifier-product-id-pid) which are covered by the same certification (e.g. certification by similarity). All other fields of a Certification Declara­ tion apply to all products in this array.
>
> The device_type_id field SHALL contain the [device type](#device-type) identifier for the primary function of the device. For example, if device_type_id is 10 (0x000A), it would indicate that the device has a pri­ mary function of a Door Lock device type. See also the \_T subtype in [Section 4.3.1.3, “Commissioning](#commissioning-subtypes) [Subtypes”](#commissioning-subtypes).
>
> The device_type_id field in a given Certification Declaration indicates the [primary device type](#primary-device-type) and SHOULD match the [device_type_id](#devicetypeid) value in the [DCL entries](#devicemodel-schema) associated with the VendorID and Pro­ ductID combinations present in that Certification Declaration.
>
> The certificate_id field SHALL contain a globally unique serial number allocated by the CSA for this Certification Declaration.
>
> The security_level and security_information fields are reserved for future use and SHALL be ignored at read time, and set to zero at issuance time.
>
> The version_number field SHALL contain a version number for the CD itself, assigned by the CSA,
>
> that matches the Vendor ID and Product ID used in a [DeviceSoftwareVersionModel](#devicesoftwareversionmodel-schema) entry in the [Dis­](#distributed-compliance-ledger) [tributed Compliance Ledger](#distributed-compliance-ledger) matching the certification record associated with the product present­ ing this CD.
>
> The value of the version_number field is not meant to be interpreted by commissioners and SHALL be recorded as assigned.
>
> The value of the version_number field is not related to any of the associated products' firmware or software version number, but is rather a numerical version number for the CD itself.
>
> The certification_type field SHALL contain the type of certification for this CD, interpreted accord­ ing to the following table:

| **certification_type** | **meaning** |
|----|----|
| 0 | used for development and test purposes |
| 1 | provisional - used for a device when going into certification testing, or to allow production and distribution to occur in parallel with certifica­ tion (with potential software fixes yielding a higher SoftwareVersion which gets certification) |
| 2 | official - allocated after passing certification |
| other values | reserved |

> For details about the usage of the certification_type field in the Device Attestation Procedure, see [failure of Device Attestation Procedure](#_bookmark539).
>
> The dac_origin_vendor_id field, if present, SHALL contain the [Vendor ID](#encoding-of-vendor-id-and-product-id-in-subject-and-issuer-fields) value expected to be found in the Device Attestation Certificate’s subject DN.
>
> The dac_origin_product_id field, if present, SHALL contain the [Product ID](#encoding-of-vendor-id-and-product-id-in-subject-and-issuer-fields) value expected to be found in the Device Attestation Certificate’s subject DN.
>
> The dac_origin_vendor_id and dac_origin_product_id SHALL only be present together.
>
> The use of the dac_origin_vendor_id and dac_origin_product_id fields allows for a target of the device attestation procedure to have a manufacturing provenance which differs from the entity that obtains the ultimate certification. If present, they tie a given Certification Declaration to an original manufacturer’s device attestation chain of trust, so that DACs MAY be issued at manufac­ turing time without *a priori* knowledge of the ultimate vendor.
>
> The optional authorized_paa_list field, if present, SHALL contain a list of one or more Product Attestation Authority (PAA) which is/are authorized (by the device manufacturer) to sign the Prod­ uct Attestation Intermediate (PAI) Certificate which signs the Device Attestation Certificate for a product carrying this Certification Declaration. Each such PAA is identified by the Subject Key Iden­ tifier (SKI) extension value of its certificate.
>
> Any context-specific tags not listed in the above schema for Certification Elements SHALL be reserved for future use, and SHALL be silently ignored if seen by a Commissioner which cannot
>
> understand them.
>
> See [Section 6.2.3, “Device Attestation Procedure”](#device-attestation-procedure) for more details about usage of the Certification Declaration fields.
>
> *Certification Declaration CMS ASN.1 Encoding Format*

[TABLE]

> The Certification Declaration encoding rules:

1.  The format SHALL only support CMS version v3.

2.  The digestAlgorithm SHALL use the sha256 algorithm.

3.  The signatureAlgorithm SHALL use the ecdsa-with-SHA256 (ECDSA with SHA256) and secp256r1

> curve, as defined in Section 2.4.2 of [SEC 2](#_bookmark77).

4.  The eContentType SHALL use the pkcs7-data type.

5.  The subjectKeyIdentifier SHALL contain the subject key identifier (SKI) of a well-known Con­ nectivity Standards Alliance certificate, that was used to generate the signature. The format of the key identifiers supported is available as part of the Certification Policy.

6.  The eContent field SHALL contain the TLV-encoded Certification Elements TLV structure (see [Certification Elements TLV structure](#_bookmark593)).

> Note that Certification Declarations SHALL NOT be generated by any Node, but rather, they SHALL be stored and transmitted to a Commissioner by a Commissionee during the conveyance of the [Attestation Information](#attestation-information) in response to an [Attestation Request command](#attestationrequest-command).
>
> See [Section F.1, “Certification Declaration CMS test vector”](#certification-declaration-cms-test-vector) for a complete example of generating a Certification Declaration.

### Firmware Information

> Firmware Information is an optional component of the [Device Attestation Information](#attestation-information) (see [Section](#device-attestation-procedure) [6.2.3, “Device Attestation Procedure”](#device-attestation-procedure)).
>
> Firmware Information MAY contain one or more Firmware Digests that correspond to the compo­ nents in the firmware that have been measured and recorded during the boot process (e.g., boot­ loader, kernel, root filesystem, etc), and MAY contain other metadata. A Firmware Digest SHALL either represent a hash of the corresponding firmware layer or a hash of the signed manifest that was used to validate the corresponding firmware layer during secure boot. An implementation MAY choose to hash the measurements of all components into a single hash and include only that hash in Firmware Information.
>
> A device MAY report Firmware Information containing its firmware digests only if it implements a secure subsystem that protects the device attestation private key and is able to securely collect and report firmware digests as shown in [Figure 40, “Illustration of the measured boot process”](#_bookmark596). This process is known as "measured boot".
>
> Ideally, the measured boot process SHOULD be rooted in silicon such as a boot ROM, similar to the secure boot process found in many systems-on-chip (SoCs). Since many SoCs and microcontrollers are unable to perform measured boot in hardware, the process SHOULD start at the earliest firmware component possible (for example, at the bootloader shown in the figure below). In this case, this firmware component is not measured and in fact, it is the root for measurement. There­ fore, it SHALL be resistant to attacks compromising subsequent firmware components (e.g., the ROM must verify its authenticity (secure boot) or it may be placed in a locked partition at the fac­ tory that cannot be updated by software in the field).

![](media/image43.png)

> *Figure 40. Illustration of the measured boot process*
>
> The device secure subsystem SHALL use the device attestation private key to sign [attestation-ele­](#attestation-elements) [ments](#attestation-elements) and [NOCSR-elements](#nocsr-elements). The device secure subsystem SHALL fill the [attestation-elements](#attestation-elements) fields using information compiled into its image or generated during the measured boot process. The device secure subsystem SHALL validate all signing requests so that if the device software, but not its secure subsystem, gets compromised it cannot act as a signing oracle to sign Attestation Informa­
>
> tion Responses with fake Firmware Digests.
>
> The firmware_information field in [attestation-elements](#attestation-elements) SHALL NOT be generated by devices that do not implement a separate secure subsystem, in software or hardware, which maintains and con­ trols the use of the device attestation private key.
>
> For devices that support secure boot, it is straightforward to add support for measured boot. Specif­ ically, the hashes of the different firmware components that are already generated and verified sequentially during secure boot SHALL be collected and stored for reporting. Devices that do not support secure boot MAY implement measured boot by generating the hashes in software during the boot process implementing the root for measurement in the earliest firmware component.
>
> If a device that chooses to send Firmware Digests and which supports an industry-standard mea­ sured boot architecture and which can generate signed firmware attestation reports, the secure subsystem in the device MAY validate the firmware attestation reports locally and SHALL report the raw firmware digests in [attestation-elements](#attestation-elements) so that the firmware_information field in [attesta­](#attestation-elements) [tion-elements](#attestation-elements) has the same values in all devices of the same model that run the specific Software Image.
>
> Firmware Digests SHALL NOT be reported by devices that implement a single firmware component in the boot chain, because there is nothing to measure and report subsequently, unless they have support for measured boot built in the device’s boot ROM.
>
> Commissioners MAY use the reported firmware information to confirm that the firmware version is authorized to run on the device, that it has not been revoked, or that it does not contain known vulnerabilities. Commissioners and Administrators that choose to verify this information SHOULD refer to canonical databases, such as the Distributed Compliance Ledger (see [Section 11.23, “Distrib­](#distributed-compliance-ledger) [uted Compliance Ledger”](#distributed-compliance-ledger)) to validate that the reported firmware information matches what is expected for an authorized Software Image associated with a given Certification Declaration. The firmware information, when validated, SHALL be validated as an opaque well-known octet string. Internal semantic validation MAY be applied for error-reporting, but the exact format is out of the scope of this specification.
>
> In cases where a Commissioner or Administrator detects such an invalid or problematic firmware version, Commissioners and Administrators MAY, after consultation with the user, refuse to com­ mission the device, provide it with operational credentials, or otherwise operate it, until the firmware has been updated, to avoid putting the user at risk from compromised software.

### Firmware information validation examples

> Below is an illustrative example of the Commissioner actions to validate the firmware information.

1.  Retrieve the firmware_information field from [attestation-elements](#attestation-elements)

2.  Retrieve all [Distributed Compliance Ledger](#distributed-compliance-ledger) [DeviceSoftwareVersionModel](#devicesoftwareversionmodel-schema) entries for the Com­ missionee’s Vendor ID and Product ID.

3.  Verify that there is a valid, non-revoked, entry where the FirmwareInformation field exactly matches the firmware_information field in [attestation-elements](#attestation-elements).

4.  If verification fails, report error to the user

5.  If verification succeeds, proceed with device commissioning

> Below is an example of the corresponding Device actions. For illustrative purposes, it is assumed that the device implements a secure subsystem that maintains the private device attestation key and signs [attestation-elements](#attestation-elements) using this key but it does not have direct hardware support for mea­ sure boot. This is expected to be the common case for many devices covered by this version of the specification. Consequently, the measurement process can only start from the bootloader shown in the figure above.

1.  The device bootloader produces a measurement of the OS kernel using a supported hash algo­ rithm from RFC 5912 and delivers it to the secure subsystem.

2.  The secure subsystem receives the measurement and stores in a location inaccessible to the OS.

3.  The OS kernel produces a hash of the root filesystem and delivers the measurement to the secure subsystem.

4.  When the secure subsystem is asked to sign an attestation-elements structure using its private device attestation key, it generates two FirmwareDigests or one combined FirmwareDigest from these measurements, fills the firmware_information field in attestation-elements using these measurements, fills the CD blob compiled into the secure environment and signs the attestation- elements structure.

> The Device Vendor is responsible to provide the FirmwareInformation field when a new Software Image entry is reported in the corresponding [Distributed Compliance Ledger](#distributed-compliance-ledger) entry.

> Below is an exemplary ASN.1 schema for an encoding scheme that could be used to encode firmware information.

## Node Operational Credentials Specification

### Introduction

> The Node Operational credentials are a collection of credentials to enable a Node to identify itself within a Fabric. The Node Operational credentials are distinct from the Device Attestation creden­ tials. The Node Operational credentials are installed during [Commissioning](#commissioning-flows).
>
> The Node Operational credentials include the following items:

- [Node Operational Key Pair](#node-operational-key-pair)

- [Node Operational Certificate (NOC)](#node-operational-certificate-noc)

- [Intermediate Certificate Authority (ICA) Certificate (optional)](#intermediate-ca-ica-certificate)

- [Trusted Root Certificate Authority (CA) Certificate(s)](#trusted-root-ca-certificates)

> Each Node in a Fabric is identified with a [Node Operational Identifier](#node-operational-identifier-composition). In order to securely identify the Node, the Node Operational Identifier is bound to the Node Operational Public Key as both are contained within the signed NOC. The Node Operational Identifier is a constituent part of the sub­ ject field of the NOC, according to the rules described in [Matter DN Encoding Rules](#matter-dn-encoding-rules). A connecting Node can attest to the validity of the Node Operational Public Key and the Node Operational Identi­ fier in a received NOC because the NOC is signed by a CA that the connecting Node trusts. Used with [Certificate Authenticated Session Establishment (CASE)](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case), these data provide the basis for secure communications on the Fabric.

### Node Operational Credentials Management

> Commands from the [Node Operational Credentials Cluster](#node-operational-credentials-cluster) are used to install and update Node Operational credentials.
>
> A Node receives its initial set of Node Operational credentials through the [AddNOC](#addnoc-command) command when it is commissioned onto a Fabric by a Commissioner.
>
> Once installed, Node Operational credentials MAY be updated by an Administrator with the appro­ priate privileges using the [UpdateNOC](#updatenoc-command) command.
>
> Once installed, Node Operational credentials MAY be removed by an Administrator with the appro­ priate privileges using the [RemoveFabric](#removefabric-command) command. The removal uses RemoveFabric, since the Fabric association for the given Node Operational credentials may underpin a variety of bindings and other [fabric-scoped](#fabric-scoped-data) configuration, which would remain in an inconsistent state if the Node Opera­ tional credentials alone were removed, as opposed to the entire associated Fabric and data.

### Node Operational Identifier Composition

> The Node Operational Identifier is used for Node discovery and network address resolution within a network segment. The FabricID portion of the Node Operational Identifier serves a scoping pur­ pose to identify disjoint operational Fabrics within a given network segment. The NodeID portion of the Node Operational Identifier is the logical addressing identifier used:

- within Message-layer messages for logical addressing (see [Section 4.4, “Message Frame Format”](#message-frame-format))

- within Data Model bindings to express data subscription relationships between Nodes (see [Sys­](#chapter-9.-system-model-specification) [tem Model](#chapter-9.-system-model-specification))

- within Access Control List Entries to refer to individual Nodes as access control grantees (sub­ jects) when [CASE](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case) sessions are used for communication (see [Section 9.10, “Access Control Clus­](#access-control-cluster) [ter”](#access-control-cluster))

> In addition to the FabricID and NodeID, a Node Operational Identifier MAY include at most three 32- bit CASEAuthenticatedTag ([1.3.6.1.4.1.37244.1.6](#_bookmark2007)) attributes used to tag the operational identifier to implement access control based on [CASE Authenticated Tags](#_bookmark647).
>
> The Fabric ID is a 64-bit value that identifies the Fabric and is scoped to a particular Root CA. For example, two fabrics with the same Fabric ID are not equivalent unless their Root CA are the same. The Fabric ID MAY be chosen randomly or algorithmically but it SHALL be allocated uniquely within the set of all possible Fabric IDs for which a given Root CA will sign operational certificates.
>
> Before allocating the Fabric ID, the Commissioner SHOULD attempt to ensure that an existing Fab­ ric is reused and joined, if any is applicable from the perspective of the Commissioner in the cur­ rent commissioning context. The method used for determining local Fabric ID existence is vendor- specific.
>
> The Node ID is a 64-bit value that identifies a Node within a Fabric. The Node ID MAY be chosen randomly or algorithmically but it SHALL be allocated uniquely within the Fabric before it is given to the Node or otherwise used. The Node ID SHALL be chosen, by a Commissioner, at the time of Node commissioning.
>
> The uniqueness constraint for Fabric ID is only required to be ensured within the scope of the Root CA serving the Commissioner.

### Node Operational Key Pair

> A Node Operational Key Pair, comprised of a Node Operational Public Key and a Node Operational Private Key, is created using the [Crypto_GenerateKeypair](#key-generation) function. A new Node Operational Key Pair is generated for each Commissioning Session in accordance with [security requirements](#chapter-13.-security-requirements).

### Node Operational Credentials Certificates

> All certificates in the Node Operational credentials are X.509v3 certificates compliant with [RFC 5280](#_bookmark54), encoded in such a way that they respect the constraints in the [Operational_Certificate](#introduction-3) section. They may be encoded as [X.509v3](#_bookmark54) certificates or [Matter Operational Certificates](#introduction-3) ("Matter Certificates" thereafter). The signature field of a certificate SHALL be calculated using the X.509v3 encoding of the certificate.

#### Node Operational Certificate (NOC)

> The NOC SHALL be issued by either a Root CA trusted within the Fabric or by an Intermediate Cer­ tificate Authority (ICA) whose ICA certificate is directly issued by such a Root CA. The NOC is bound to the Node Operational Key Pair through the [Node Operational Credential Signing Request](#node-operational-certificate-signing-request-nocsr) [(NOCSR)](#node-operational-certificate-signing-request-nocsr).
>
> The validity period specifies the time period for which a NOC is valid. For constrained or sleepy devices that lack accurate time, enforcement of an NOC’s validity period MAY be omitted.

#### Intermediate CA (ICA) Certificate

> In the case where an intermediate CA (ICA) issues the NOC, the ICA certificate is used to attest to the validity of the NOC. The Root CA certificate associated with the issuer of the ICA certificate is used in turn to attest to the validity of the ICA certificate.

#### Trusted Root CA Certificates

> Each Node has one or more trusted Root CA certificates in its Node Operational credentials that it uses to verify ICA certificates and Node Operational Certificates presented by other Nodes, treating them as trust anchors as described in [RFC 5280](#_bookmark54). A Root CA certificate is self-signed. They are not verified but rather trusted because they were provisioned by a trusted Commissioner.
>
> In the case where a Root CA issues the NOC, the Root CA certificate is used to attest to the validity of the NOC.
>
> The trusted Root CA certificates that a Device trusts when the Device is verifying operational certifi­ cates are those stored in the [TrustedRootCertificates attribute](#trustedrootcertificates-attribute) of that Device’s [Node Operational](#node-operational-credentials-cluster) [Credentials cluster](#node-operational-credentials-cluster).
>
> A device MAY have Root CA certificates that it trusts for purposes other than for operational creden­ tial verification. These certificates SHALL NOT appear in any Node’s [TrustedRootCertificates](#trustedrootcertificates-attribute) [attribute](#trustedrootcertificates-attribute) of the [Node Operational Credentials cluster](#node-operational-credentials-cluster). The certificates configured in that cluster SHALL only be added during the commissioning process by the Commissioner, or during root rota­ tion operations by an Administrator already trusted by the Node. Nodes SHALL NOT modify the [TrustedRootCertificates attribute](#trustedrootcertificates-attribute) outside of the processing of [Node Operational Credentials cluster](#node-operational-credentials-cluster) commands.
>
> The figures below show the Node Operational Certificate hierarchies, with and without optional ICAC.

### Node Operational Credentials Procedure

> The following procedure is used by a Node to obtain an Operational Credential. This procedure is part of [Commissioning](#commissioning-flows).

#### Node Operational Certificate Signing Request (NOCSR) Procedure

> After the Commissioner validates Device Attestation Information, the following procedure is used to generate a Node Operational Key Pair and obtain the NOCSR.

1.  The Commissioner SHALL generate a random 32 byte nonce named CSRNonce using [Crypto\_­](#deterministic-random-bit-generator-drbg) [DRBG()](#deterministic-random-bit-generator-drbg).

2.  The Commissioner SHALL send the CSRNonce to the Node and request NOCSR Information using the [CSRRequest Command](#csrrequest-command).

    1.  The Node SHALL create a new candidate Node Operational Key Pair, using [Crypto_Gener­](#key-generation) [ateKeyPair()](#key-generation), valid for the duration of the [Fail-Safe Context](#armfailsafe-command) currently in progress.

    2.  The Node SHOULD verify that the newly generated candidate Node Operational Key Pair does not match any other existing Node Operational Key Pair on the device. If such a key col­ lision was to be found, it would indicate a key pair that was not properly randomly gener­ ated. The procedure SHALL fail if such a collision is detected. See [CSRRequest](#csrrequest-command) for the error generated in that situation.

    3.  The candidate Node Operational Key Pair SHALL only be committed to persistent storage upon successful execution of the next [AddNOC Command](#addnoc-command) executed with a Node Operational Certificate whose public key matches the candidate key.

    4.  The Node SHALL create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) by following the format and pro­ cedure in [PKCS \#10](#_bookmark45), which includes a signature using the Node Operational Private Key (see [RFC 2986](#_bookmark45) section 4.2).

    5.  The CSR’s subject MAY be any value and the device SHOULD NOT expect the final opera­ tional certificate to contain any of the CSR’s subject DN attributes.

3.  The Node SHALL generate and return the NOCSR Information (see [Section 11.18.4.9, “NOCSR](#nocsr-information)

> [Information”](#nocsr-information) for encoding) to the Commissioner using the [CSRResponse Command](#csrresponse-command). The NOCSR Information includes a signature using the Device Attestation Private Key.
>
> **Node Operational CSR Information Validation**

1.  The Commissioner SHALL validate the Device Attestation Signature ([attestation_signature](#attestation-information)) field from [CSRResponse Command](#csrresponse-command):

> where the fields are encoded as described in [Section 11.18.4.9, “NOCSR Information”](#nocsr-information).

- The AttestationChallenge SHALL be obtained from a [CASE session](#_bookmark389), [resumed CASE session](#_bookmark390), or [PASE session](#_bookmark363) depending on the method used to establish the secure session within which device attestation is conducted.

- The CSR Nonce in [NOCSR Information](#nocsr-information) SHALL match the Commissioner’s CSR Nonce.

2.  The inner signature in the PKCS#10 csr sub-field of the [CSRResponse Command](#csrresponse-command)'s NOCSRElements

> field SHALL be verified, per the definition of CSR signatures in [PKCS \#10](#_bookmark45).
>
> ![](media/image46.png)
>
> *Figure 43. Node Operational Credentials flow*

### Node Operational Certificate Signing Request (NOCSR)

> A Node creates a NOCSR in response to the Commissioner, so that the Commissioner can request a [NOC](#node-operational-certificate-noc) on the Node’s behalf from its trusted Certificate Authority. The CSR itself SHALL follow the encoding and rules from [PKCS \#10](#_bookmark45), with the minimum attributes shown in the example below.
>
> Note that the subject field MAY be any value.
>
> *NOCSR*

[TABLE]

[TABLE]

### Node Operational Certificate Renewal

> A [NOC](#node-operational-certificate-noc) can be renewed by an Administrator (a Node that has Administer privileges on the Node to be updated). The Administrator triggers the process by sending an [CSRRequest Command](#csrrequest-command).

### Node Operational Certificate Revocation

> A Node’s access to other Nodes can be revoked by removing the associated Node ID from [Access](#_bookmark993) [Control Entry subjects](#_bookmark993) where it appears. This action is taken by an Administrator which has the privilege to update the Access Control Cluster for its Nodes.

### VendorID Validation Procedure

> Whenever a client requires determining whether a given ICAC/RCAC is associated with a fabric administered by a given vendor, a VendorID Validation Procedure SHALL be used. The Vendor ID validation procedure takes the following arguments:

- [ec-pub-key](#public-key) belonging to an [ICAC](#intermediate-ca-ica-certificate)/[RCAC](#trusted-root-ca-certificates).

- [pub-key-algo](#public-key-algorithm) and [ec-curve-id](#ec-curve-identifier) associated with [ec-pub-key](#public-key).

- [Vendor ID](#vendor-identifier-vendor-id-vid) to validate against the chain.

> The procedure is as follows:

1.  Use the ec-pub-key for computation of the subject-key-id as described in [Section 6.5.11.4, “Sub­](#subject-key-identifier-extension) [ject Key Identifier Extension”](#subject-key-identifier-extension)

2.  Search in the DCL [OperationalTrustAnchors Schema](#operational-root-and-intermediate-certificate-schema) to determine if there is any entry matching the subject-key-id and the Vendor ID.

3.  Convert the certificate returned by DCL from PEM to Matter TLV Certificate and execute the fol­ lowing operations on it:

    1.  Validate the [DN Encoding Rules](#matter-dn-encoding-rules), including valid value range checks for identifiers such as Fabric ID.

    2.  Check that values for ec-pub-key, pub-key-algo, ec-curve-id match with the ones provided as input.

> If all the validations above have succeeded, return a list containing the [ICAC](#intermediate-ca-ica-certificate)/[RCAC](#trusted-root-ca-certificates). Otherwise return an empty list.

#### NOTE

> Vendors operating operational CAs need to consider whether they are operationally sharing a root with other vendors. This could cause the potential for that other ven­ dor to associate NOC chains with a different vendor, since validation of chaining is done only against the trust anchor (root).
>
> Support for [VendorID Validation Procedure](#vendorid-validation-procedure-1) is provisional.

### Security Considerations

> A [NOC](#node-operational-certificate-noc) is a Node’s credential to operate on a Fabric. It SHALL be protected against the following threats:

1.  The Node Operational Private Key SHALL be protected from unauthorized access.

2.  The Node Operational Private Key SHOULD never leave the device.

3.  The NOC SHALL NOT contain information that may violate the user’s privacy.

4.  The NOC SHALL be wiped if the Node is factory reset.

## Operational Certificate Encoding

### Introduction

> This section details the **Matter certificate data structure** (hereafter "Matter certificate"), a specific encoding that is sometimes used as a compact alternative to the standard X.509 certificate format \[[RFC 5280](#_bookmark54)\] for bandwidth-efficient transmission. A [Node Operational Certificate (NOC)](#node-operational-certificate-noc), [Intermedi­](#intermediate-ca-ica-certificate) [ate CA certificate](#intermediate-ca-ica-certificate) and [Root CA certificate](#trusted-root-ca-certificates) MAY all be encoded as a Matter certificate.
>
> To compress the structure more efficiently than an X.509 certificate, a Matter certificate SHALL be encoded with the Matter TLV structured data interchange language \[[Appendix A,](#appendix-a-tag-length-value-tlv-encoding-format) *[Tag-length-value](#appendix-a-tag-length-value-tlv-encoding-format) [(TLV) Encoding Format](#appendix-a-tag-length-value-tlv-encoding-format)*\] instead of the ASN.1 Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) \[[X.690](#_bookmark87)\].
>
> This section provides a technical specification of the structure of data comprising a Matter certifi­ cate with accompanying requirements for their semantic validation, and their conversion to and from X.509 certificates. In some cases, as noted, the limitations on the semantic interpretation of parts of a Matter certificate follow from limitations applied by \[[RFC 5280](#_bookmark54)\].
>
> A certificate comprises a record of the following conceptual fields:

[TABLE]

[TABLE]

#### ASN.1 Object Identifiers (OID)

> Several important components of X.509 certificates follow the pattern commonly used in ASN.1 data models where some types are constructed with an ASN.1 object identifier (OID) to identify each variant. For example, the cryptographic algorithm used in the digital signature is identified by its OID.
>
> Matter certificates do not use ASN.1 OIDs. Instead, each valid ASN.1 OID SHALL be mapped to a Matter TLV tag within its reference category. Each reference category defines the context of the Matter tag, and tag values are assigned to the reference categories according to the type of fields where they can appear in X.509 certificates.

### Matter certificate

> A Matter certificate encodes a subset of the object identifiers (OIDs) specified in X.509. Only some attribute types for relative distinguished names are valid, only certain cryptographic algorithms (corresponding to the algorithms as defined in [Chapter 3,](#chapter-3.-cryptographic-primitives) [*Cryptographic Primitives*](#chapter-3.-cryptographic-primitives)) are used, and only a limited set of extensions are used. Therefore, every Matter certificate can be represented as a corresponding X.509 certificate. However, the converse is not true; not every X.509 certificate can be represented as a Matter certificate.
>
> The signature included in a Matter certificate is the signatureValue of the corresponding X.509 cer­ tificate, not a signature of the preceding Matter TLV data in the Matter certificate structure. Accord­ ingly, validating the signature in a Matter certificate entails its logical conversion to the correspond­ ing X.509 certificate to recover the original tbsCertificate of the basic syntax signed by the Certifi­ cate Authority (CA).

[TABLE]

[TABLE]

### Version Number

> Matter certificates SHALL only support version X.509 v3. This field is not encoded in the Matter cer­ tificate structure.

### Serial Number

> The context-specific tag serial-num \[1\] SHALL be used to identify the serial number field in the Matter certificate structure.
>
> A Matter certificate follows the same limitation on admissible serial numbers as in \[[RFC 5280](#_bookmark54)\], i.e., that implementations SHALL admit serial numbers up to 20 octets in length, and certificate authori­ ties SHALL NOT use serial numbers longer than 20 octets in length.

### Signature Algorithm

> Like an X.509 certificate, a Matter certificate SHALL include a digital signature in its signature com­ ponent. The signature algorithm component of a Matter certificate specifies the cryptographic algo­ rithm used for composing and validating the signature embedded in the signature component of the certificate. The signature algorithm SHALL match the algorithm in [Section 3.5.3, “Signature and](#signature-and-verification) [verification”](#signature-and-verification).
>
> The context-specific tag sig-algo \[2\] SHALL be used to identify the signature algorithm field in the Matter certificate structure.

[TABLE]

> The following values SHALL be defined for signature-algorithm:
>
> *Table 63. Signature Algorithm Object Identifiers*

[TABLE]

### Issuer and Subject

> The context-specific tags issuer \[3\] and subject \[6\] SHALL be used to identify the issuer and the
>
> subject DN fields in the Matter certificate structure. The entries in the lists SHALL be Distinguished Names (DNs), which are described in [Section 6.5.6.1, “X.501 Distinguished Names”](#x.501-distinguished-names).

#### X.501 Distinguished Names

> The Issuer Name and Subject Name components of an X.509 certificate contain DNs as defined in \[[RFC 5280](#_bookmark54)\]. The ASN.1 format of a DN is a sequence of Relative Distinguished Names (RDNs). Two distinguished names DN1 and DN2 match if they have the same number of RDNs, for each RDN in DN1 there is a matching RDN in DN2, and the matching RDNs appear in the same order in both DNs.
>
> The RDN in an X.509 certificate may be encoded as a set of one or more DN attributes, although in practice it is usually a single DN attribute. The RDN in a Matter certificate SHALL be always a single DN attribute. Two relative distinguished names RDN1 and RDN2 match if the attribute in RDN1 matches the attribute in RDN2.

[TABLE]

[TABLE]

> [Table 64, “Standard DN Object Identifiers”](#_bookmark624) lists the context-specific tags defined for the standard DN attribute types used in Matter that can be encoded in X.509 certificates as either UTF8String or as PrintableString format. In Matter certificates, the context-specific tag is logically-ORed with 0x80 (and its name given a corresponding -ps suffix) to indicate that the corresponding X.509 encoding of the attribute uses the PrintableString format instead of UTF8String.
>
> *Table 64. Standard DN Object Identifiers*

[TABLE]

[TABLE]

> [Table 65, “Standard DN Domain Component Object Identifier”](#_bookmark625) lists the context-specific tag defined for the standard DN attribute type used in Matter that is encoded in X.509 certificates as IA5String.
>
> *Table 65. Standard DN Domain Component Object Identifier*

[TABLE]

> In addition to the standard DN attribute types, there are Matter-specific DN attribute types under the [1.3.6.1.4.1.1.37244](#appendix-e-matter-specific-asn.1-object-identifiers-oids) private arc. See [Section 6.1.1, “Encoding of Matter-specific RDNs”](#encoding-of-matter-specific-rdns) for con­ straints and examples related to usage of Matter-specific DN attribute types.

#### Matter Certificate Types

> The Matter-specific DN attribute types convey information about Matter-specific certificate types as listed in [Table 66, “Matter Certificate Types”](#_bookmark626).
>
> *Table 66. Matter Certificate Types*

| **Matter name** | **Description** |
|----|----|
| matter-node-id | Certifies the identity of a [Matter Node Operational Certificate (NOC)](#node-operational-certificate-noc). |
| matter-firmware-signing-id | Certifies the identity of a firmware signing certificate. |
| matter-icac-id | Certifies the identity of a [Matter Intermediate CA (ICA) Certificate](#intermediate-ca-ica-certificate). |
| matter-rcac-id | Certifies the identity of a [Matter Root CA Certificate](#trusted-root-ca-certificates). |

> The value of matter-icac-id and matter-rcac-id DN attribute types MAY be any 64-bit identifier desired by the certificate’s issuer. Apart from marking what type of certificates are involved, they MAY be used for debugging purposes to determine the specific CA in use, for example if different production tiers or regions are used.

#### Matter DN Encoding Rules

> The rules that SHALL be followed for Matter-specific attribute types when encoding the subject DN are:

- For a [Matter Node Operational Certificate (NOC)](#node-operational-certificate-noc):

  - The subject DN SHALL encode exactly one matter-node-id attribute.

    - The matter-node-id attribute’s value SHALL be in the Operational Node ID range (0x0000_0000_0000_0001 to 0xFFFF_FFEF_FFFF_FFFF), see [Table 4, “Node Identifier Allo­](#_bookmark119)

> [cations”](#_bookmark119).

- The subject DN SHALL encode exactly one matter-fabric-id attribute.

  - The matter-fabric-id attribute’s value SHALL NOT be 0 (see [Section 2.5.1, “Fabric Refer­](#fabric-references-and-fabric-identifier) [ences and Fabric Identifier”](#fabric-references-and-fabric-identifier)).

- The subject DN SHALL NOT encode any matter-icac-id attribute.

- The subject DN SHALL NOT encode any matter-rcac-id attribute.

- The subject DN MAY encode at most three matter-noc-cat attributes.

  - Each matter-noc-cat attribute present, if any, SHALL encode a different [CASE Authenti­](#_bookmark647) [cated Tag identifier](#_bookmark647) (upper 16 bits of value) than is used by other matter-noc-cat attrib­ utes (CATs).

&nbsp;

- For a [Matter ICA Certificate](#intermediate-ca-ica-certificate):

  - The subject DN SHALL NOT encode any matter-node-id attribute.

  - The subject DN MAY encode at most one matter-fabric-id attribute.

    - If present, the matter-fabric-id attribute’s value SHALL NOT be 0 (see [Section 2.5.1, “Fab­](#fabric-references-and-fabric-identifier) [ric References and Fabric Identifier”](#fabric-references-and-fabric-identifier)).

  - The subject DN SHALL encode exactly one matter-icac-id attribute.

  - The subject DN SHALL NOT encode any matter-rcac-id attribute.

  - The subject DN MAY encode at most one matter-fabric-id attribute.

    - If present, the matter-fabric-id attribute’s value SHALL NOT be 0 (see [Section 2.5.1, “Fab­](#fabric-references-and-fabric-identifier) [ric References and Fabric Identifier”](#fabric-references-and-fabric-identifier)).

  - The subject DN SHALL NOT encode any matter-icac-id attribute.

  - The subject DN SHALL encode exactly one matter-rcac-id attribute.

  - The subject DN SHALL NOT encode any matter-noc-cat attribute.

- When any matter-fabric-id attributes are present in either the [Matter Root CA Certificate](#trusted-root-ca-certificates) or the [Matter ICA Certificate](#intermediate-ca-ica-certificate), the value SHALL match the one present in the [Matter Node Operational](#node-operational-certificate-noc) [Certificate (NOC)](#node-operational-certificate-noc) within the same certificate chain.

- The order of the attributes can be issuer-specific and is not enforced by Matter specifications.

- All implementations SHALL accept, parse, and handle Matter certificates with up to 5 RDNs in a single DN.

- All implementations SHALL reject Matter certificates with more than 5 RDNs in a single DN.

> In addition to the above rules, the encoding constraints in [Section 6.1.1, “Encoding of Matter-spe­](#encoding-of-matter-specific-rdns) [cific RDNs”](#encoding-of-matter-specific-rdns) SHALL be followed.

#### Matter DN Examples

> The following is an example of subject DN encoding for a [Matter Node Operational Certificate](#node-operational-certificate-noc) [(NOC)](#node-operational-certificate-noc). Typically, it is a list of two RDN attributes:

[TABLE]

> In addition to the mandatory attributes, it may also encode other supported RDN attributes such as
>
> common-name and [CASE Authenticated Tags](#_bookmark647) as presented below:

[TABLE]

> The following subject DN example illustrates that multiple RDN attributes of the same type can be encoded. The specific order of attributes is not enforced. Note that number of RDN attributes in the subject field SHALL NOT exceed five:

[TABLE]

> The following example illustrates an illegal subject DN due to the presence of the same [CASE](#_bookmark647) [Authenticated Tag](#_bookmark647) value with two different version numbers.

[TABLE]

> The following is an example of subject DN encoding for a [Matter Root CA certificate](#trusted-root-ca-certificates). In this case, the
>
> Matter Root CA certificate is not associated with a specific Matter fabric:

[TABLE]

> The following is another example of subject DN encoding for a [Matter Root CA certificate](#trusted-root-ca-certificates). In this case, the Matter Root CA certificate is associated with a specific Matter fabric. This DN also encodes an issuer-specific common-name RDN attribute:

[TABLE]

### Validity

> The context-specific tags not-before \[4\] and not-after \[5\] SHALL be used to identify the not-before and not-after fields in the Matter certificate structure, which indicate the period of validity for the certificate. These two fields SHALL be encoded as unsigned integers. The value of these fields SHALL be encoded as a UTC time of type [epoch-s](#epoch-time-in-seconds-type) (Epoch Time in Seconds).
>
> Special value 0, when encoded in the not-after field, corresponds to the X.509/[RFC 5280](#_bookmark54) defined special time value 99991231235959Z meaning no well-defined expiration date.

### Public Key Algorithm

> The context-specific tag pub-key-algo \[7\] SHALL be used to identify the public key algorithm field in the Matter certificate structure.

[TABLE]

> The following values SHALL be defined for public-key-algorithm:
>
> *Table 67. Public Key Algorithm Object Identifiers*

[TABLE]

### EC Curve Identifier

> The context-specific tag ec-curve-id \[8\] SHALL be used to identify the elliptic curve field in the Matter certificate structure.

[TABLE]

> The following values SHALL be defined for elliptic-curve-id:
>
> *Table 68. Elliptic Curve Object Identifiers*

[TABLE]

### Public Key

> The context-specific tag ec-pub-key \[9\] SHALL be used to identify the elliptic curve public key mate­ rial field in the Matter certificate structure. The public key SHALL be a byte string representation of an uncompressed elliptic curve point as defined in section 2.3.3 of [SEC 1](#_bookmark76).

### Extensions

> The context-specific tag extensions \[10\] SHALL be used to identify the extensions field in the Mat­ ter certificate structure. The extensions list SHALL NOT contain more than one instance of a partic­ ular extension. The following table summarizes context-specific tags defined for the certificate extension types used in Matter.

[TABLE]

> *Table 69. Extensions Object Identifiers*

[TABLE]

[TABLE]

> These context-specific tags identify the extension entries in the extensions list. The type of each extension is further described in the subsections below.

#### Basic Constraints Extension

> The basic constraints extension identifies whether the subject of the certificate is a CA and the max­ imum depth of valid certification paths that include this certificate.
>
> When present, the basic constraints extension SHALL be treated as critical and it SHALL be marked as critical in the corresponding X.509 certificate. The critical field SHALL NOT be encoded in the Matter certificate structure.
>
> The context-specific tag basic-cnstr \[1\] SHALL be used to identify a basic constraints extension entry in the Matter certificate extensions list.

[TABLE]

> The is-ca field SHALL be encoded regardless of the value (true or false). The path-len-constraint
>
> MAY be present only when is-ca == true.

#### Key Usage Extension

> The key usage extension defines the purpose of the key contained in the certificate.
>
> When present, the key usage extension SHALL be treated as critical and it SHALL be marked as critical in the corresponding X.509 certificate. The critical field SHALL NOT be encoded in the Matter certificate structure.
>
> The context-specific tag number key-usage \[2\] SHALL be used to identify a key usage extension entry in the Matter certificate extensions list.
>
> The key-usage field is derived as a logical OR of all key-usage-flag values that apply to the corre­
>
> sponding public key:

[TABLE]

#### Extended Key Usage Extension

> The extended key usage extension indicates one or more purposes for which the certified public key may be used, in addition to or in place of the basic purposes indicated in the key usage exten­ sion.
>
> When present, the extended key usage extension SHALL be treated as critical and it SHALL be marked as critical in the corresponding X.509 certificate. The critical field SHALL NOT be encoded in the Matter certificate structure.
>
> The context-specific tag number extended-key-usage \[3\] SHALL be used to identify an extended key usage extension entry in the Matter certificate extensions list.
>
> The extended-key-usage field SHALL be encoded as an array of key-purpose-id values, where each
>
> key-purpose-id value SHALL be encoded as 8-bit unsigned integer:

[TABLE]

> The following values SHALL be defined for key-purpose-id:
>
> *Table 70. Key Purpose Object Identifiers*

[TABLE]

[TABLE]

> The key-purpose-id values in the extended-key-usage array SHALL be encoded in the same order as they appeared in the corresponding X.509 certificate.

#### Subject Key Identifier Extension

> The subject key identifier extension provides a means of identifying Matter certificates that contain a particular public key.
>
> When present, the subject key identifier extension SHALL be treated as non-critical and it SHALL be marked as non-critical in the corresponding X.509 certificate. The critical field SHALL NOT be encoded in the Matter certificate structure.
>
> The context-specific tag number subject-key-id \[4\] SHALL be used to identify a subject key identi­ fier extension entry in the Matter certificate extensions list.
>
> The Subject Key Identifier field SHALL be derived from the public key using method (1) described in section 4.2.1.2 of \[[RFC 5280](#_bookmark54)\]. Thus, the subject-key-id SHALL be composed of the 160-bit SHA-1 hash of the certificate’s subject public key value.
>
> See [Section 6.1.2, “Key Identifier Extension Constraints”](#key-identifier-extension-constraints) for additional constraints.

#### Authority Key Identifier Extension

> The authority key identifier extension provides a means of identifying the public key correspond­ ing to the private key used to sign a Matter certificate.
>
> When present, the authority key identifier extension SHALL be treated as non-critical and it SHALL be marked as non-critical in the corresponding X.509 certificate. The critical field SHALL NOT be encoded in the Matter certificate structure.
>
> The context-specific tag number authority-key-id \[5\] SHALL be used to identify an authority key identifier extension entry in the Matter certificate extensions list.
>
> Note that the authority key identifier extension field in an X.509 certificate may optionally include issuer and serial number fields, which are not supported by Matter certificates.
>
> The Authority Key Identifier field SHALL be derived from the public key using method (1) described in section 4.2.1.2 of \[[RFC 5280](#_bookmark54)\]. Thus, the authority-key-id SHALL be composed of the 160-bit SHA-1 hash of the public key used to verify the certificate’s signature.
>
> See [Section 6.1.2, “Key Identifier Extension Constraints”](#key-identifier-extension-constraints) for additional constraints.

#### Future Extension

> The Matter certificate is designed with extensibility in mind and this field is added to support arbi­ trary certificate extension in the future.
>
> Note that implementations that do not support specific future extension will ignore it but will be able to use it for the Matter certificate signature validation. If ignored extension is marked as criti­ cal then validation of the corresponding Matter certificate SHALL fail.
>
> The context-specific tag number future-extension \[6\] SHALL be used to identify all future exten­ sion entries in the Matter certificate extensions list. There MAY be more than one future extension field.
>
> The future-extension field SHALL be encoded as OCTET STRING and it SHALL be an exact copy of the DER encoded extension field (including the DER encoded ASN.1 OID of the extension) in the cor­ responding X.509 certificate. These extension fields in a Matter certificate SHALL be encoded in the same order as they appeared in the original X.509 certificate.

### Matter certificate Extensions Encoding Rules

> The rules that SHALL be followed when encoding the Matter certificate are:

- For a [Matter Node Operational Certificate (NOC)](#node-operational-certificate-noc):

  - The basic constraints extension SHALL be encoded with is-ca set to false.

  - The key usage extension SHALL be encoded with exactly one flag: digitalSignature.

  - The extended key usage extension SHALL be encoded with exactly two [key-purpose-id](#_bookmark636) val­ ues: serverAuth and clientAuth.

  - The subject key identifier extension SHALL be present.

  - The authority key identifier extension SHALL be present.

- For [Matter ICA Certificate](#intermediate-ca-ica-certificate) and [Matter Root CA Certificate](#trusted-root-ca-certificates):

  - The basic constraints extension SHALL be encoded with is-ca set to true.

  - The key usage extension SHALL be encoded with at least the two flags keyCertSign and CRL­ Sign included, and MAY include a third flag: digitalSignature. No additional flags are per­ mitted.

  - The extended key usage extension SHALL NOT be present.

  - The subject key identifier extension SHALL be present.

  - The authority key identifier extension SHALL be present.

  - For the [Matter Root CA Certificate](#trusted-root-ca-certificates) the authority key identifier extension SHALL be equal to the subject key identifier extension.

- For a Matter Firmware Signing Certificate these rules SHALL be followed:

  - The basic constraints extension SHALL be encoded with is-ca set to false.

  - The key usage extension SHALL be encoded with exactly one flag: digitalSignature.

  - The extended key usage extension SHALL be encoded with exactly one [key-purpose-id](#_bookmark636) val­

> ues: codeSigning.

- The subject key identifier extension SHALL be present.

- The authority key identifier extension SHALL be present.

&nbsp;

- The extensions SHALL appear in the same order in the Matter certificate and in the correspond­ ing X.509 certificates.

> Note that Matter doesn’t specify how firmware images are signed and implementation of firmware image signing is manufacturer-specific. However, since firmware image signing is a common fea­ ture, the format for Matter TLV certificates has affordances for encoding firmware signing certifi­ cates.

### Signature

> The context-specific tag signature \[11\] SHALL be used to identify the signature field in the Matter certificate structure.
>
> An ec-signature is the encoding of the signature as defined in [Section 3.5.3, “Signature and verifica­](#signature-and-verification) [tion”](#signature-and-verification).

[TABLE]

### Invalid Matter certificates

> The Matter certificate is considered invalid if it violates Matter certificate encoding rules defined in this section. The processing of invalid Matter certificate SHOULD fail and an error SHOULD be reported to the application. Here is a non-exhaustive list of errors that may invalidate the certifi­ cate:

- Matter certificate structure includes elements that are not defined in this section.

- Matter certificate elements are encoded in a wrong order.

- Matter certificate element has wrong type.

- Length of an element is outside of its valid range, for example:

  - serial-num field is longer than 20 octets.

  - not-before or not-after field is longer than 32-bits.

  - subject-key-id or authority-key-id field is different from 20 octets.

- Matter OID values encoded in Matter certificate are not defined in this section, for example:

  - sig-algo field encodes value, which is not defined in [Table 63, “Signature Algorithm Object](#_bookmark621) [Identifiers”](#_bookmark621).

  - pub-key-algo field encodes value, which is not defined in [Table 67, “Public Key Algorithm](#_bookmark630) [Object Identifiers”](#_bookmark630).

  - ec-curve-id field encodes value, which is not defined in [Table 68, “Elliptic Curve Object Iden­](#_bookmark632) [tifiers”](#_bookmark632).

    - key-purpose-id field of the Extended Key Usage Extension encodes value, which is not defined in [Table 70, “Key Purpose Object Identifiers”](#_bookmark636).

&nbsp;

- Invalid Matter Distinguished Names encoding for Issuer and Subject DNs. Refer to [Section](#matter-dn-encoding-rules) [6.5.6.3, “Matter DN Encoding Rules”](#matter-dn-encoding-rules) for more details. For example:

  - Node Subject DN doesn’t include Matter specific matter-node-id or matter-fabric-id

> attribute.

- Firmware signing Subject DN doesn’t include Matter specific matter-firmware-signing-id

> attribute.

- Intermediate CA Subject DN doesn’t include Matter specific matter-icac-id attribute.

- Root CA Subject DN doesn’t include Matter specific matter-rcac-id attribute.

- Certificate Subject DN encodes matter-node-id and matter-rcac-id, which contradict each other.

- Multiple matter-cat-id with the same identifier value and different version numbers, or any

> matter-cat-id with a version number of 0.

- CA certificate doesn’t have Basic Constraints Extension is-ca field set to 'true'.

- key-usage field of the Key Usage Extension has undefined flags.

- Certificate extension that SHALL be marked as critical is marked as non-critical in the X.509 representation and vise versa.

## Access Control

### Scope and Purpose

> This section specifies the features related to controlling access to a Node’s Endpoint Clusters ("Tar­ gets" hereafter) from other Nodes. The overall features are collectively named "Access Control" hereafter.
>
> The Access Control features aim to ensure that only authorized Nodes are permitted access to given application-layer functionality exposed by the Data Model, through the Interaction Model. Access Control is the fundamental link between the Secure Channel and the Interaction Model.
>
> In order to implement a policy of Access Control, Administrators on the fabric create and maintain a consistent distributed configuration of Access Control Lists (ACLs) across all Nodes. Each Node has an ACL containing Access Control Entries which codify the policy. The Access Control Cluster exposes a data model view of a Node’s ACL which enables its maintenance. In addition to the ACL, a per-fabric [Access Restriction List](#arl-attribute) (ARL), which is set by the device, MAY exist. The ARL contains Access Restriction Entries, which identify the attributes, commands and events on specific endpoint clusters which are not accessible on a given fabric. The Access Control Cluster exposes a data model view of a Node’s ARL, which enables its discovery.

### Model

> The Access Control system is rule-based with no implicit access permitted by default. Access to a Node’s Targets is denied unless the Access Control system grants the required privilege level to a given Subject to interact with given Targets on that Node. Initial Access Control privileges are [boot­](#bootstrapping-of-the-access-control-cluster) [strapped](#bootstrapping-of-the-access-control-cluster) during the commissioning phase, and maintained thereafter by Administrators.
>
> All access privileges, from the [AccessControlEntryPrivilegeEnum](#accesscontrolentryprivilegeenum-type) enumeration, SHALL be granted by Access Control. Thus, the Initiator ("Subject" hereafter) of any Interaction Model action SHALL NOT succeed in executing a given action on a Node’s Target unless that Node’s Access Control sys­ tem explicitly grants the required privilege to that Subject for that particular action.
>
> The Access Control system grants privileges by checking and verifying all attempted access against rules explicitly codified in Access Control Entries within the Node’s Access Control List and its Access Restriction List. Additionally, Access Control implicitly grants administrative access privi­ leges to an Administrative Subject during a Node’s [commissioning phase](#commissioning-flows), with the exception of commands, attributes and events identified by the Node’s Commissioning Access Restriction List.
>
> Access Control Entries contain:

- A [FabricIndex](#fabricindex-field) scoping the entry to the [Associated Fabric](#fabric-scoped-data).

- A Privilege level granted by the entry (see [AccessControlEntryPrivilegeEnum](#accesscontrolentryprivilegeenum-type))

  - *View*: reading or subscribing to data from a non-[Proxy](#subscription-proxy-overview)

  - *Proxy View*: reading or subscribing to data from a [Proxy](#subscription-proxy-overview)

  - *Operate*: writing operational data and invoking operational commands

  - *Manage*: writing configuration data and invoking configuration commands (for example,

> Binding and Group Clusters access)

- *Administer*: writing administrative data and invoking administrative commands (for exam­ ple, Access Control and Commissioning Clusters access)

&nbsp;

- A list of target Clusters to which the entry applies

- A list of source Subjects to which the entry applies

- An Authentication Mode that describes the type of secure channel authentication method to which the entry’s subjects apply

> Access Restriction Entries contain:

- A [FabricIndex](#fabricindex-field) scoping the entry to the [Associated Fabric](#fabric-scoped-data) (entries applied during commissioning do not include a Fabric Index)

- An endpoint to which the entry applies

- A cluster to which the entry applies

- A list of restricted data model elements (attributes, commands and events) for the cluster

#### Subjects

> The meaning of a "Subject" is primarily that of describing the source for an action, using a given authentication method provided by the Secure Channel architecture. A subject SHALL be one of:

- A passcode, identified by a Passcode ID, authenticated locally by a [PASE](#passcode-authenticated-session-establishment-pase) session, during the com­ missioning phase.

- Note that any Passcode ID other than 0, which is the default commissioning passcode, is reserved for future use.

- Furthermore, ACL entries with a PASE authentication mode SHALL NOT be explicitly added to the Access Control List, since there is an invisible implicit administrative entry (see [Section](#bootstrapping-of-the-access-control-cluster) [6.6.2.9, “Bootstrapping of the Access Control Cluster”](#bootstrapping-of-the-access-control-cluster)) always equivalently present on the Com­ missionee (but not the Commissioner) during PASE sessions.

  - A source node, authenticated by a [CASE](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case) session using its Operational Certificate, during the operational phase. The source node can be identified by its [Node ID](#node-identifier) and/or by [CASE Authenti­](#_bookmark647) [cated Tags](#_bookmark647).

  - A destination group, identified by a destination Group ID in the message, authenticated by an Operational Group Key from the Group Key Management Cluster, during the operational phase.

1.  **PASE and Group Subjects**

> Note that the subject is not considered to be an individual Node when the authentication is via pass­ code or group symmetric key; in these cases, the administrative root of trust is conditional only upon bearing the correct passcode during session establishment, or bearing the Operational Group Key when constructing a group message.

2.  **Subjects identified by CASE Authenticated Tag**

> In contrast, a CASE Authenticated Tag (CAT) is a [special subject distinguished name](#x.501-distinguished-names) within the Oper­ ational Certificate shared during CASE session establishment that functions as a group-like tag. Such a tag can be applied to several Nodes, thereby facilitating management of Access Control Entries that use the same set of Nodes as subjects. Because these tags are authenticated within the CASE session context, the administrative root of trust does chain back through the individual source Node to the Fabric’s [trusted root](#trusted-root-ca-certificates). This makes CATs suitable for group-like use while main­ taining secure authentication and attribution ability.
>
> Each CAT is 32-bit and equally divided into identifier value and its corresponding version:

- The upper 16-bits are allocated to identifier value

- The lower 16-bits are allocated to the version number The identifier value uniquely identifies a CAT.

> The CAT identifier value space is allocated as described in the [Table 71, “CAT Identifier Value Alloca­](#_bookmark648) [tions”](#_bookmark648). This table reserves space for the use of CAT identifiers that SHOULD NOT be used for any other purposes other than specified. [Table 71, “CAT Identifier Value Allocations”](#_bookmark648) lists the allocation rules of CAT identifiers that SHALL be used for the [Joint Fabric](#joint-fabric-1).
>
> *Table 71. CAT Identifier Value Allocations*

| **Range**        | **Type**                        |
|------------------|---------------------------------|
| 0xFFFF           | Administrator identifier        |
| 0xFFFE           | Anchor identifier               |

| 0xF000 to 0xFFFB | Reserved for future use         |
| 0x0000 to 0xEFFF | Generally available             |

> The [CAT Identifier Space](#_bookmark648) reserves the following identifiers for special use within the context of the [Joint Fabric](#joint-fabric-1) and SHALL NOT apply to fabrics other than the [Joint Fabric](#joint-fabric-1).

- 0xFFFF SHALL represent the [Administrator CAT](#administrator-cat) identifier. The Administrator CAT SHALL be used to grant Administer privilege to a group of Administrator Nodes participating in the context of the [Joint Fabric](#joint-fabric-1). See [Administrator CAT](#administrator-cat) for more details. The version number of the Adminis­ trator CAT SHALL be initially set to 0x0001.

- 0xFFFE SHALL represent the [Anchor CAT](#anchor-cat) identifier. The Anchor CAT SHALL be used to validate a Node as a [Joint Fabric](#joint-fabric-1) Anchor. See [Anchor CAT](#anchor-cat) for more details. The version number of the Anchor CAT SHALL be initially set to 0x0001.

- 0xFFFD SHALL represent the [Datastore CAT](#datastore-cat) identifier. The Datastore CAT SHALL be used to vali­ date a Node as a [Joint Fabric](#joint-fabric-1) Datastore. See [Datastore CAT](#datastore-cat) for more details. If the Node is also a [Joint Fabric](#joint-fabric-1) Anchor then the [Anchor/Datastore CAT](#anchordatastore-cat) SHALL be used instead. The version number of the Datastore CAT SHALL be initially set to 0x0001.

- 0xFFFC SHALL represent the [Anchor/Datastore CAT](#anchordatastore-cat) that serves as a combination of the [Anchor](#anchor-cat) [CAT](#anchor-cat) and [Datastore CAT](#datastore-cat) identifiers as a single identifier. The Anchor/Datastore CAT SHALL be used to validate a Node as both a [Joint Fabric](#joint-fabric-1) Anchor and [Joint Fabric](#joint-fabric-1) Datastore. See [Anchor/Datastore CAT](#anchordatastore-cat) for more details. The version number of the Anchor/Datastore CAT SHALL be initially set to 0x0001.

> The version number represents the current version of specific identifier value. An Administrator MAY increment the version number on any changes in the set of Nodes sharing the given tag. Ver­ sion number is a monotonically increasing natural number in the range of 1 to 65535. A version number of 0 is invalid and SHALL NOT be used. On reaching the maximum value (65535), wrap- around is not supported and the tag identifier SHOULD be retired by an Administrator since ver­ sion increase will no longer be possible.
>
> When a CAT appears in the Subjects list of an Access Control Entry, it SHALL be encoded within the CASE Authenticated Tag sub-space of [Node Identifiers](#node-identifier), with the upper 32 bits set to 0xFFFF_FFFD. Note that this encoding cannot appear as an operational Node ID. It is merely a sub-encoding allow­ ing the 64-bit scalars in an Access Control Entry’s Subjects list to represent both Node IDs and CATs.

#### Example CASE Authenticated Tags

- Joint Fabric Administrator Tag identifier 0xFFFF, Version 0x0001

  - CAT value: 0xFFFF_0001

  - Appears in Access Control Entry Subjects list as 0xFFFF_FFFD_FFFF_0001

  - Appears in [Node Operational Certificate](#matter-dn-encoding-rules) subject under OID [1.3.6.1.4.1.37244.1.6](#_bookmark2007) with value 0xFFFF0001

    - Would appear in X.509 certificate subject under OID [1.3.6.1.4.1.37244.1.6](#_bookmark2007) as UTF8String

> FFFF0001 for signature validation purposes.

- Tag identifier 0xAB12, Version 0x0003

  - CAT value: 0xAB12_0003

  - Appears in Access Control Entry Subjects list as 0xFFFF_FFFD_AB12_0003

  - Appears in [Node Operational Certificate](#matter-dn-encoding-rules) subject under OID [1.3.6.1.4.1.37244.1.6](#_bookmark2007) with value 0xAB120003

  - Appears in [Node Operational Certificate](#matter-dn-encoding-rules) subject under OID [1.3.6.1.4.1.37244.1.6](#_bookmark2007) with value 0x071C1074

    - Would appear in X.509 certificate subject under OID [1.3.6.1.4.1.37244.1.6](#_bookmark2007) as UTF8String

> 071C1074 for signature validation purposes.

#### Wildcards

> The Subjects list of an Access Control Entry MAY grant a given privilege to more than one Subject, if the Authentication Mode allows it, such as in the case of the [CASE](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case) and Group Authentication Modes. An empty Subjects list SHALL mean that every possible Subject employing the stated Authentication Mode is granted the entry’s privilege over the Targets.
>
> The Targets list of an Access Control Entry MAY grant a given privilege to more than one Target. An empty Targets list SHALL mean that every Cluster on every Endpoint exposed by the Node is acces­ sible using the granted privilege to any matching Subject. Each Target in the Targets list SHALL specify Cluster instances directly by Cluster ID (on any Endpoint, or limited to particular End­ points), indirectly by Endpoint ID (all Cluster instances on that Endpoint), or indirectly by Device Type ID (all Cluster instances on all Endpoints containing that Device Type).
>
> For both the Subjects list and Targets list of an Access Control Entry, empty lists permit a rudimen­ tary form of "wildcard" behavior, which is especially useful for codifying policies providing com­ mon view/read/discover access to a given subset of Nodes based on Authentication Mode.

#### CAUTION

> Given that "wildcard" (that is, **any** subject/target) granting is possible with an empty Subjects list or an empty Targets list, it follows that care must be taken by Administrators generating and distributing Access Control Lists to ensure unin­ tended access does not arise. It is RECOMMENDED to avoid updating Access Control Entries in such a way as to remove Subjects or Targets one by one, which may result in a wildcard after individual actions. Rather, entire Tar­ gets/Subjects lists SHOULD be written atomically in a single action, to ensure a complete final state is achieved, with either wildcard or not, and that no acci­ dental wildcards arise. Furthermore, such ACL entries with wildcard subject should be deployed with care as they grant the named privilege level to poten­ tially many senders, especially when Group Authentication Mode is specified.

#### Subjects do not correspond to users

> The Subjects for an Access Control Entry are logical subjects, configured through policy by an Administrator, including possibly a Commissioner during the commissioning phase. A given imple­ mentation of administrative logic MAY assign authentication identities to Nodes directly associated with physical end-users (for example, a mobile device of a given end-user). However, since Nodes are logical networking entities, the specific policy of how Node identities are mapped to physical end-users and physical devices is implementation-specific. Therefore, the access granted by a given
>
> Node’s Access Control system should not be construed as having any particular meaning in regards to physical end-users other than the fact that a given set of Administrators computed a consistent set of Access Control Lists to effect a desired system functionality across all Nodes they administer and end-users they represent.

#### Implementation-specific Rules

> Since the target of a given Access Control Entry is a list of Targets, and since Targets (that is, Clusters on Endpoints) are Interaction Model constructs, it should be assumed that access control function­ ality as described within this model is constrained to the interaction model layer. However, con­ straints on incoming session establishment requests MAY be affected by the Access Control system, based on implementation-defined rules. For example, a Node MAY deny [CASE](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case) session establishment from an initiator whose identity doesn’t match any Access Control Entry. These types of rules are implementation-specific and SHOULD be carefully considered, if applied at all. For example, due to the richness of Access Control Entry encoding for Subjects, significant care has to be taken to avoid incorrectly rejecting an incoming [CASE](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case) session establishment that could be valid. Rejecting valid connections could cause a Node to become unreachable. Any constraints on transport-level and net­ work-level functionality, including but not limited to the availability of commissioning-mode con­ nectivity, are out of Access Control scope.

#### Incoming Subject Descriptors

> The Message Layer SHALL provide sufficient metadata (e.g. Authentication Mode, source identity) about incoming messages to the Interaction Model protocol layer in order to properly enforce Access Control.
>
> An Incoming Subject Descriptor (ISD) is a mapping from the security layer fields of an incoming Message to a tuple of \<AuthMode, SubjectDescriptor\> that can map unambiguously to an Access Con­ trol Entry’s Subjects and AuthMode fields. See [Section 6.6.6.1.3, “Incoming Subject Descriptor (ISD)](#_bookmark654) [Structure”](#_bookmark654) for further details.

#### Access Control Extensions

> An implementation MAY use [Access Control Extensions](#extension-attribute) to extend the base Access Control model. Since all extensions are installed by Administrators for a fabric, it is expected that only extensions that would improve overall security will be applied. Since every Vendor MAY implement extensions as they see fit, it SHOULD NOT be expected that an extension will be supported by every Node. It is therefore RECOMMENDED that careful consideration of interoperability concerns be given when implementing Access Control Extensions. A fabric’s Administrators MAY always read a given Node’s Access Control Entries and Access Control Extensions pertaining to the fabric. Therefore, Adminis­ trators MAY use extensions to record auditing metadata about Access Control Entries which are not for operational use by the Node.
>
> A Node SHALL preserve every field of the installed Access Control Cluster, including extensions when present, without internally-initiated modifications, so that they may be read-back verbatim upon receiving an appropriate request from an Administrator.

#### Application-level Permissions

> The Access Control Cluster SHALL NOT be used to encode application-level permissions and config­ urations such as smart lock PIN codes or similar user-facing security functionality. Application-level security is best served by finer-grained capabilities described and addressed by application- domain-specific clusters.

#### Access Restrictions

> An Access Control Entry in the ACL describes permissions granted by the fabric Administrator. In contrast, an Access Restriction Entry in the ARL describes restrictions imposed by the device. The ARL restrictions override permissions granted in the ACL.

#### Bootstrapping of the Access Control Cluster

> Updates to the Access Control List through Access Control Cluster attributes and commands SHALL be restricted by the same Access Control mechanisms as all other clusters on the Node, and there­ fore require a grant of Administer privilege. Administrators are able to bootstrap a Node’s Access Control List during the [commissioning phase](#commissioning-flows) due to the [Access Control Privilege Granting algorithm](#conceptual-access-control-privilege-granting-algorithm) implicitly granting the Administer privilege to Administrative Subject Nodes over a PASE commis­ sioning channel; this implicit privilege grant applies for the Commissioner to administer the Com­ missionee, but not in the opposite direction.

#### Action attribution

> The recording of a given Interaction Model Action’s attribution to a source entity is distinct from the contents of an Access Control Entry. Action Attribution SHALL be recorded against the Incoming Subject Descriptor (see [Section 6.6.6.1.3, “Incoming Subject Descriptor (ISD) Structure”](#_bookmark654)) rather than against any matched Access Control Entry’s contents.

#### Restrictions on Administer Level Privilege Grant

> Since the Administer privilege level grants wide access to a Node for a given Subject, it SHALL NOT be valid to have an Administer privilege set on an Access Control Entry, unless the AuthMode's Auth­ ModeCategory is "CASE". For example, an AuthModeCategory of "Group", which admits no source Node authentication and reduced attribution ability, SHALL NOT be used to grant Administer privilege.

### Access Control List Examples

> The following Access Control Lists illustrate the flexibility of codifying access control policy using concrete examples.
>
> Upon Factory Data Reset, the Access Control Cluster is empty, having an Access Control List with no entries.

> However, the Access Control Privilege Granting algorithm behaves as if, over a PASE commission­ ing channel during the [commissioning phase](#commissioning-flows), the following implicit Access Control Entry were present on the Commissionee (but not the Commissioner) to grant Administer privilege for the entire Node.

[TABLE]

> During the commissioning phase, the [AddNOC](#addnoc-command) command automatically creates an Access Control Entry granting Administer privilege for the appropriate [CaseAdminSubject](#_bookmark1601).
>
> In the scenario the node is being commissioned onto a separately-administered fabric, Administer privilege is granted for the entire Node, using the appropriate CASE authenticated Subject (in this case, Node ID 0xAAAA_AAAA_AAAA_AAAA) on the appropriate Fabric (in this case, Fabric 0xFAB0_0000_0000_001D as Fabric index 1).

[TABLE]

> In the scenario the node is being commissioned onto the Joint Fabric the Administer privilege SHALL be granted for all Nodes with the Administrator CAT as the [CaseAdminSubject](#_bookmark1601) (in this case, 0xFFFF_FFFD_FFFF_0001) on the appropriate Fabric (in this case, Fabric 0xFAB0_0000_0000_001D as Fabric index 1).

[TABLE]

> An Administrator adds an Access Control Entry which grants View privilege, for the entire Node, to all CASE authenticated Nodes.

[TABLE]

> An Administrator adds an Access Control Entry which grants Manage privilege, for endpoints 1 and 3, to any Nodes which can authenticate as members of Group 1.

[TABLE]

|     |
|-----|

> An Administrator revises this Access Control Entry to grant the same privilege, for only the pump configuration and control cluster (0x0202) on endpoint 3, and for any door lock cluster (0x0101) on the entire Node, to the same Nodes.

[TABLE]

> An Administrator adds an Access Control Entry which grants Operate privilege, for all endpoints containing the extended color light device (0x010D) on the entire Node, to CASE authenticated Nodes 0x1111_1111_1111_1111 and 0x2222_2222_2222_2222.

[TABLE]

> A Commissioner adds four more Nodes into an existing fabric. These new Nodes have Node IDs 0x3333_3333_3333_3333, 0x4444_4444_4444_4444, 0x5555_5555_5555_5555 and
>
> 0x6666_6666_6666_6666 respectively. The Fabric Administration policy requires associating these four nodes and an existing node (0x2222_2222_2222_2222) into a CAT group.
>
> To achieve this, an Administrator will issue NOCs to all five nodes in this CAT group with a CAT value of 0xABCD_0001, which is tag identifier value 0xABCD and version 1, and encoded as subject
>
> value 0xFFFF_FFFD_ABCD_0001. To distribute these CATs, an Administrator obtains NOCs from its certificate authority with the requisite subjects including the desired CAT. They are either initially provisioned with the AddNOC command during initial commissioning (for the new Nodes) or updated with UpdateNOC (for existing Nodes).
>
> Then the Administrator grants permissions to the five nodes by updating the ACL of all relevant tar­ gets by adding an entry with subject of [CAT](#_bookmark647) (0xFFFF_FFFD_ABCD_0001). The Administrator may also remove entries where Node 0x2222_2222_2222_2222 appears as an explicit Subject if presenta­ tion of the CAT identifier value 0xABCD and version value 0x0001 confers an equivalent privilege. Note that any Node with CAT identifier value of 0xABCD and version value 0x0001 or higher in their NOC will have this privilege.

[TABLE]

> An Administrator wants to remove the Node with Node ID 0x3333_3333_3333_3333 from the CAT group defined by CAT identifier value of 0xABCD, as installed in the previous example.
>
> The Administrator could follow the steps outlined below:

1.  Administrator will ensure that the removed node having Node ID 0x3333_3333_3333_3333 will not receive a new NOC with an CAT identifier value of 0xABCD. Note that the node removed from the group will continue to hold existing NOC (with CAT identifier of 0xABCD and version 0x0001).

2.  An Administrator updates NOCs with CAT identifier value of 0xABCD and version 0x0002 (encoded as subject 0xFFFF_FFFD_ABCD_0002) in all remaining currently reachable Nodes within the CAT group to ensure they continue to have same privilege as before. In this example, Nodes having Node IDs 0x2222_2222_2222_2222, 0x4444_4444_4444_4444 and 0x5555_5555_5555_5555 are currently reachable.

3.  Node with Node ID 0x6666_6666_6666_6666 from this CAT group is a valid member but was not reachable by an Administrator at the time of this change. This Node will continue to hold exist­ ing NOC with CAT of 0xABCD_0001.

4.  After updating NOCs of all reachable Nodes, the Administrator SHOULD revise the Access Con­ trol Entry of all reachable nodes who have the previous CAT (encoded as subject 0xFFF­ F_FFFD_ABCD_0001) in an ACL entry, to remove privilege from the Node no longer in the group­

> ing (i.e. those with version 0x0001) by increasing trusted version value to be higher than 0x0001. The Administrator decides to increment version value by one to set the new version value to be 0x0002.

5.  Once ACL changes are propagated to all controlled nodes, they will no longer allow access privi­ leges to any Node with older version (i.e. value less than 0x0002) of CAT identifier value 0xABCD. Hence, the node removed from the group, having Node ID 0x3333_3333_3333_3333 and CAT with identifier 0xABCD and version of 0x0001, can no longer access any of the controlled nodes whose ACL entries were updated to have a subject of 0xFFFF_FFFD_ABCD_0002 (CAT identifier value 0xABCD, version 0x0002).

6.  Node having Node ID of 0x6666_6666_6666_6666 will not be able to access any Nodes by relying on CAT, since it does not have an NOC with latest CAT (with version 0x0002). However, it can still access Nodes that list it as a subject Node ID explicitly. When an Administrator eventually estab­ lishes connection to this Node, the Administrator SHOULD update the NOC to the latest version, with CAT set to 0xABCD_0002. After having its NOC updated to have the newest version of the CAT, the Node with Node ID 0x6666_6666_6666_6666 will again have access to Nodes that list subject 0xFFFF_FFFD_ABCD_0002 (CAT identifier value 0xABCD, version 0x0002), with no fur­ ther updates to ACL entries of existing Nodes.

7.  Any controlled Node which previously held an ACL Entry with prior version of the updated CAT (subject 0xFFFF_FFFD_ABCD_0001) but was not reachable by an Administrator at the time of update, will continue to hold the previous Access Control Entry with a subject allowing CAT with identifier of 0xABCD and version 0x0001 or higher. Thus, these Nodes will grant privileges to any Node from the original CAT group (including Node ID 0x3333_3333_3333_3333). When an Administrator eventually establishes connection to this Node with older ACL entry, the Adminis­ trator SHOULD update it with the latest value, so that Node ID 0x3333_3333_3333_3333 no longer has privileges.

> Note that in the above example, the CAT identifier value remained the same (0xABCD) in NOCs and ACL entries throughout these steps. Only the version portion was updated to effect changes to the meaning of the CAT.
>
> As can be seen in the example above, there are multiple steps involving updates to NOCs and ACL entries to affect CAT-based grouping and aliasing policies. It is therefore possible that some Nodes may not receive these changes immediately, due to network reachability issues, such as being pow­ ered down for an extended period, and thus have ACL entries or NOCs that grant temporarily obso­ lete privileges. This is true as well with direct Node ID subjects, in general.
>
> Administrators SHOULD aim for best-effort eventual consistency while executing the steps outlined above.

### Access Control Cluster update side-effects

> Updates to the Access Control Cluster SHALL take immediate effect in the Access Control system. For example, given an Interaction Model action message containing the following actions, the Access Control Privilege Granting algorithm would grant a privilege of None for the second action, since the first action would take effect immediately beforehand.

- Pre-conditions:

- Access Control List has single entry: \[{Privilege: Administer, Authmode: CASE (2), Subjects: \[0x0011223344556677\], Targets: \[\]}\]

- Node ID 0x0011223344556677 over CASE is allowed Administer privilege for all targets

- Incoming message Source is Node ID 0x0011223344556677 over CASE: matches Access Control Entry subject

- Actions:

  1.  Action: Write (1st path)

      1.  Path: Endpoint\[0\]/Cluster\[AccessControl\]/Attribute\[ACL\]/ListIndex\[0\]/Field\[Targets\]

      2.  Value: \[{Endpoint: 2}\]

          - Single entry updated to target only Endpoint 2

      3.  **Granted**: Administer privilege granted, due to Access Control Entry match

  2.  Action: Write (2nd path)

      1.  Path: Endpoint\[1\]/Cluster\[OnOff\]/Attribute\[OnTime\]

      2.  **Denied**: No privilege granted, because prior action **in the same message** had updated Access Control List to only allow access to Endpoint 2, and this action targets Endpoint 1

- Post-conditions:

- Access Control List has single entry, updated by first path of Write Action: \[{Privilege: Adminis­ ter, Authmode: CASE (2), Subjects: \[0x0011223344556677\], Targets: \[{Endpoint: 2}\]}\]

- Node ID 0x0011223344556677 over CASE is allowed Administer privilege for only Endpoint 2 tar­ get

> Note that in this example, the Node has inadvertently lost its ability to update the Access Control Cluster by limiting its Administer privilege to Endpoint 2.

### Access Control Cluster handling of Access Restrictions

> In the example above, the ARL was empty, meaning that there were no access restrictions imposed upon the fabric by the device. However, the following Access Control Cluster examples illustrate
>
> how access restrictions would impact access granted to a given client.
>
> Upon Factory Data Reset, the Access Control Cluster has an Access Control List with no entries, an Access Restriction List with no entries, and a CommissioningARL set by the device which applies during commissioning sessions.

> Upon allocation of a new FabricIndex during commissioning (see [Node Operational Credentials](#node-operational-credentials-cluster) [Cluster](#node-operational-credentials-cluster) [AddNOC](#addnoc-command) command), one or more ARL entries with the new FabricIndex MAY be added to the ARL attribute at the time that the initial ACL entry for the new FabricIndex is added. Until Com­ missioningComplete command is invoked in the GeneralCommissioning cluster, the Commis­ sioningARL continues to apply.
>
> Example:

[TABLE]

[TABLE]

[TABLE]

> In this example, the restrictions during commissioning, expressed by the CommissioningARL attribute, include 3 limitations on Cluster 0x0453 of Endpoint 1: access to attribute 0x0000, all com­ mands, all events. The restrictions for the fabric at FabricIndex 1, expressed by the ARL attribute, include the same 3 limitations on Cluster 0x0453 of Endpoint 1.
>
> The CommissioningARL and ARL attributes SHALL NOT include limitations that would prevent commissioning (see [Section 9.10.4.2.1, “Managed Device Feature Usage Restrictions”](#_bookmark984)). If a wildcard restriction appears in the ARL that would restrict access in such a case, the wildcard MAY appear but the restriction SHALL NOT take effect.
>
> Superimposing this ARL value upon the example earlier in this section, when an Administrator adds, for example, an Access Control Entry which grants Operate privilege for the entire Node, to all CASE-authenticated subjects), this grant MAY be further limited by restrictions imposed by the ARL. In other words, even though the ACL entry grants Operate privilege to all data model elements, attempts to read or write attribute 0x0000, or to invoke commands upon Cluster 0x0453 of End­ point 1 would result in an error of ACCESS_RESTRICTED, since the Access Restriction List is a subse­ quent overriding of an initial privilege granted.

[TABLE]

[TABLE]

> Updates to the ARL attribute can happen at any time, for example, as a result of configuration changes made by the user within an external management user interface, out of band of the Matter protocol. In particular, the fabric Administrator can request that the device initiates a review of fabric restrictions using the ReviewFabricRestrictions command on the Access Control Cluster. This command returns a ReviewFabricRestrictionsResponse containing a Token which can be used to cor­ relate with a FabricRestrictionReviewUpdate event, indicating completion of the fabric restriction review. Such a review can result in an asynchronous update to the ARL attribute and an AccessRe­ strictionEntryChanged event.
>
> In this example, after the fabric restriction review, the ARL value is updated: the result is a single limitation on Cluster 0x0453 of Endpoint 1: access to command 0x0000. In other words, restrictions on attributes and events on Cluster 0x0453 of Endpoint 1 have been removed, and all command restrictions on the cluster except command 0x0000 have been removed.

### Conceptual Access Control Privilege Granting Algorithm

> This section describes an overall Conceptual Access Control Privilege Granting algorithm. Imple­ mentations of this algorithm SHALL have an identical outcome to the output of this conceptual algorithm described below.
>
> The Interaction Model protocol, through its message handling, SHALL determine the privilege level granted per Target, on every instance where a Target is referenced for use.

#### Necessary Data Structures

1.  **Access Control List**

> The [Access Control List](#acl-attribute) contains several [Access Control Entries](#_bookmark991), previously described in [Section](#model) [6.6.2, “Model”](#model).
>
> The entry fields are:

- Subjects List ([SubjectID](#_bookmark994)\[\] Subjects)

- Targets List (TargetStruct\[\] Targets)

- Authentication Mode value (AuthModeEnum AuthMode)

- Privilege value (PrivilegeEnum Privilege)

2.  **Access Restriction List**

> The [Access Restriction List](#arl-attribute) contains several [Access Restriction Entries](#accessrestrictionentrystruct-type), previously described in [Sec­](#model) [tion 6.6.2, “Model”](#model).
>
> The entry fields are:

- Endpoint (endpoint-no Endpoint)

- Cluster (cluster-id Cluster)

  - Restrictions List ([AccessRestrictionStruct](#accessrestrictionstruct-type)\[\] Restrictions)

3.  **Incoming Subject Descriptor (ISD) Structure**

> Each incoming message has a unique \<AuthMode, SubjectDescriptor\> applicable to it, whose deriva­ tion is deterministic based on both incoming message fields and session metadata fields. For exam­ ple, if a message arrives that matches a given CASE Session ID, then the metadata for that CASE ses­ sion would be used.
>
> Computation of the ISD is described in [Section 6.6.6.3, “Derivation of ISD from Incoming Message”](#derivation-of-isd-from-incoming-message). The ISD fields are as follows:

- Commissioning Flag (bool IsCommissioning), whether the authentication is over a commission­

> ing channel for an ongoing commissioning.

- Authentication Mode (AuthModeEnum AuthMode), mapping to an authentication mode, directly com­ parable to [Access Control Entry AuthMode](#_bookmark992).

- Subjects List (list\<SubjectID\> Subjects), mapping incoming message source to a type of subject, such as a CASE session Source Node ID.

- Fabric Index (FabricIndex FabricIndex), mapping to a fabric reference.

#### Overall Algorithm

> The algorithm takes as input:

- the Access Control List (acl) from the Access Control Cluster

- the Privilege (request_privilege) required for the given request

- the ISD of Incoming Message (subject_desc)

- the Endpoint ID (endpoint_id) for which the querier requires a Privilege level

- the Cluster ID (cluster_id) for which the querier requires a Privilege level

- the Cluster Element (cluster_element) for which the querier requires a Privilege level

- the Request Type (request_type) for which the querier requires a Privilege level (ReadAttribute, ReadEvent, WriteAttribute, InvokeCommand)

- the ARL attribute (arl_attr) from the Access Control Cluster

- the CommissioningARL attribute (commissioning_arl_attr) from the Access Control Cluster The output of the algorithm is:

- The access control status of the request, which is one of {AccessGranted, AccessRestricted, AccessDenied}.

> The algorithm first determines the set of privileges granted for the Action Path, which is a subset of
>
> {View, ProxyView, Operate, Manage, Administer} as described in [AccessControlEntryPrivi­](#accesscontrolentryprivilegeenum-type) [legeEnum](#accesscontrolentryprivilegeenum-type). If the Privilege required for the request is contained within this set, and the request is not restricted by the Access Restriction List, then the AccessGranted status is returned. If the Privi­ lege required for the request is contained within this set, and the request is restricted by the Access
>
> Restriction List, then the AccessRestricted status is returned. Otherwise, the AccessDenied status is returned.
>
> The computation of the ISD is a pre-condition to the algorithm and is described in [Section 6.6.6.3,](#derivation-of-isd-from-incoming-message) [“Derivation of ISD from Incoming Message”](#derivation-of-isd-from-incoming-message).
>
> The goal is to find the complete set of privileges granted given the input. The principle of least privi­ lege is respected by virtue of the entire Access Control List having been computed with rules such that the least privilege is granted to all subjects. Therefore, any Access Control Entry granting the [required privilege](#access) to the subject for a given target is sufficient to determine whether access is allowed.
>
> The algorithm SHALL function as follows:

#### Derivation of ISD from Incoming Message

> The algorithm to derive the ISD from an incoming message takes as input:

- The incoming message (message)

- The Session ID of the incoming message (session_id)

- A conceptual Sessions Metadata database (sessions_metadata)

- The Group Key Management Cluster (group_key_management_cluster) The output of the algorithm is the SubjectDescriptor structure below:

### Applying Privileges to Action Paths

> The Data Model specifies which privilege is required for each data element, via its access qualities.
>
> The Interaction Model specifies how each action is processed, for both its request and its response. This includes details on how the Interaction Model uses Access Control to determine whether to allow the request (i.e. continue processing), or to deny the request (and whether/how that is indi­ cated in the response).
>
> Determining whether to allow or deny an action for a request path entails:

- Determining the [required privilege](#access) for the action, given the action, request path and type of access requested;

- Determining the [set of granted privileges](#conceptual-access-control-privilege-granting-algorithm) for the action, given the request path and requesting subject;

- Checking whether the required privilege is present in the set of granted privileges:

  - If present, the action is allowed;

  - If not present, the action is denied.

> Note that the Interaction Model may allow the action for some request paths while denying it for other request paths in the same action. Also, note that Access Control is merely one of the checks used by the Interaction Model, and an action that is allowed by Access Control may fail for other reasons.

# Chapter 7. Data Model Specification

## Practical Information

### Revision History

> Please note that Matter revision 1 SHALL be considered equivalent to revision 16, Subsequent releases SHALL start at revision 17.

| **Revision** | **Description** |
|----|----|
| 1 | Equivalent to revision 16 (1st Matter release of the Data Model) |
| 2-11 | Approved specifications, but not released for implementation. |
| 12-15 | Released as revisions of the Dotdot Architecture Model specification |
| 16 | Initial release of this specification |
| 17 | Added tag data type |
| 18 | Added the LocationDescriptorStruct data type |

### Scope & Purpose

> This is part of a package of Data Model specifications that are agnostic to underlying layers (encod­ ing, message, network, transport, etc.). Each specification below may be independently maintained. This package, as a whole, SHALL be independently maintained as agnostic and decoupled from lower layers. This package may be referenced by inclusion in vertical protocol stack specifications.
>
> **[Data Model](#chapter-7.-data-model-specification)** Defines first order elements and namespace for endpoints, clusters, attributes, data types, etc.
>
> **[Interaction Model](#chapter-8.-interaction-model-specification)** Defines interactions, transactions and actions between nodes.
>
> **[System Model](#chapter-9.-system-model-specification)** Defines relationships that are managed between endpoints and clusters.
>
> **Cluster Library** Reference library of cluster specifications.
>
> **Device Library** Reference library of device type specifications.

### Origin Story

> The origin of this section is the Dotdot Architecture Model \[[Dotdot Architecture](#_bookmark90)\] and parts of Chap­ ter 2 of the Zigbee Cluster Library specification \[[ZCL](#_bookmark91)\] that define the data model.
>
> The purpose of this document is to extend and better define the data model architecture, while not breaking the certifiable cluster specifications in the Zigbee Cluster Library (currently at revision 8). Under the Matter project, new and existing clusters and device types may take advantage of
>
> extended architecture elements. Ultimately, the plan is that this architecture is available and main­ tained for all underlying certifiable protocol stacks.

### Overview

> This document defines first order elements and namespace of the data model and can also be called the meta-model (of the data model). This document is the "read me first" specification in the data model. This data model is ultimately implemented in the application layer of a communication stack.
>
> This specification does not define how data is stored, encoded or what interactions are allowed on the data.

### Conventions

> See the [Conventions](#conventions) section for conventions used in the Data Model specifications.

## Data Qualities

> [Cluster](#cluster) specifications and [device type](#device-type) definitions have tables that define the qualities of elements that make up the cluster or device type. Not all elements have all qualities. For example, a com­ mand does not have the read quality. Some elements have intrinsic qualities, that are not listed. For example, an event always has the read quality. Qualities SHALL be defined in columns in tables that describe data model elements.

### Common Data Table Columns

> The following columns are common across tables describing attributes, commands, events and structs:

#### ID

> Defines an identifier for the data model element that is unique at its context.

#### Name

> Defines a CamelCase name of the element to be used in specification text, not the protocol. Text usage SHALL always be followed with the element name (e.g. CurrentLevel attribute, Stopped event, or Left field).

#### Field

> Same as **Name**. Other headers like "Field", "Bit Field", and "Command Field", are deprecated. Use

#### Name.

> [**Conformance**](#conformance)
>
> Defines dependencies on whether an element is optional or mandatory.
>
> [**Access**](#_bookmark696)
>
> Defines how an element is accessed (e.g. read or write) and what privileges are required to access the data.

#### Summary

> A short summary of the element with no normative text.

### Description Section

> A separate section, describing a table row element, is required to include normative text, such as behavior associated with the element.

### Other Data Table Columns

> Other columns specific to the element:
>
> [**Data Type**](#data-types)
>
> A [data field](#data-field-2) requires this column for attribute, event or command data.
>
> [**Other Qualities**](#other-qualities)
>
> This is a catchall column for uncategorized qualities.
>
> [**Default**](#default-column)
>
> This defines a default value for data fields.
>
> [**Response**](#_bookmark732)
>
> Cluster command tables have this column.
>
> [**Direction**](#_bookmark733)
>
> Cluster command tables have this column.

#### Priority

> [Event](#event) tables have this column.

#### Value

> Enumerations use this column instead of the **ID** column.

## Conformance

> A Conformance column defines optionality and dependency for any data model element or set of elements. This column is valid for attributes, commands, events, enumerations, and fields of com­ mands, events or structures.

| **Conformance Column** | **Name** | **Summary** |
|----|----|----|
| M | Mandatory | This is part of the base manda­ tory feature set and is manda­ tory for current revision. |
| O | Optional | This is a purely optional ele­ ment with no dependencies, except the M set. |
| P | Provisional | See [Provisional](#provisional-conformance) below. |
| D | Deprecated | This is a deprecated item that MAY occur in legacy implemen­ tations, but not in the current revision. |
| X | Disallowed | This is disallowed for the clus­ ter derivation. |
| *AB* | Mandatory | This SHALL be supported if *AB* is true. *AB* is a boolean expres­ sion |
| \[*AB*\] | Optional | This MAY be supported only if *AB* is true. Brackets also act as parentheses. |
| *EF* | Operand | True if *EF* feature or element is supported. |
| *EF*==*v* | Equal | True if *EF* is equal to the fixed and non-changing value *v*. |
| *EF*!=*v* | UnEqual | True if *EF* does not equal the non-changing value *v*. |
| *AB* \| *CD* | Or | True if either *AB* or *CD* is true. |
| *AB* ^ *CD* | Xor | True if only one of *AB* or *CD* is true, not both. |
| *AB* & *CD* | And | True if both *AB* and *CD* are true. |
| !*AB* | Exclusivity | True if *AB* is false. |
| (*AB* & *CD*) | Parentheses | Parentheses can be put around any conformance expression to combine. |
| *C1*, *C2*… | Otherwise | A conformance that is a list of boolean expressions, processed left to right. |
| *C*.*an* | Choice | Exclusive choices between a number of elements with the same conformance |

### Operands in Conformance

> Supported operands in a conformance expression are:

- feature code

- element in the same table (e.g. attribute, field or value)

### Feature Code in Conformance

> A feature code evaluates to TRUE, if the feature is supported.

### Element in Conformance

> An element name, by itself, SHALL evaluate to TRUE if the element exists. Only an attribute with the Fixed quality SHALL support evaluation as a value.

### Optional Conformance

> Optionality with "\[\]" SHALL be defined for an entire expression and not for parts of an expression. Individual conformance list entries MAY define optionality with "\[\]", but not the entire list.
>
> For example: The expression "\[AA\] & BB" is illegal, however, "\[AA & BB\]" or "AA & BB" is legal. For example: The expression "AA \| \[BB\]" is illegal, however, "\[AA \| BB\]" or "AA, \[BB\]" is legal.
>
> The tag "O" SHALL define the element as optional for the revision. "O" SHALL only be used by itself, without operators, to mean optional without dependencies, or SHALL be used in a conformance list ending in ", O", to mean otherwise optional.

### Provisional Conformance

> The tag "P" defines the element as provisional. "P" may be used in a list, where the intended confor­ mance or list follows the "P". If the intended conformance has not been determined, then nothing appears after the "P".
>
> It is recommended that the intended future conformance be noted, so that when the provisional marking is removed, the intended conformance becomes the current conformance.
>
> For example: "P, M" means provisional, but mandatory, when not provisional in the future.
>
> For example: "P, \[AA & BB\]" means provisional for now, but optional if AA & BB are true, when not provisional in the future.
>
> For example: "\[AA\], P" means optional for AA and provisional otherwise, where the future confor­ mance is unknown at this time.
>
> Each provisional element SHALL be listed in a higher level specification, that includes the data model, and data model derived specifications that use this notation.

### Mandatory Conformance

> The tag "M" SHALL define the element as mandatory. "M" SHALL only be used by itself, without operators, to mean mandatory without dependencies, or SHALL be used in a conformance list end­ ing in ", M", to mean otherwise mandatory.

### Disallowed Conformance

> The tag "X" is used when a derived cluster removes support for some elements. The tag "X" SHALL define the element as disallowed for the revision of the derivation. "X" SHALL only be used by itself, without operators.

### Deprecated Conformance

> The tag "D" SHALL define the element as disallowed for the revision. Previous revisions MAY sup­ port this element and conformance is defined in such previous revisions. "D" SHALL only be used by itself, without operators, to mean disallowed for the current revision, or SHALL be used in a con­ formance list ending in ", D", to mean that now it is still allowed (based on the conformance preced­ ing the ", D"), but it is planned to be deprecated in the future after some grace period.

### Exclusivity Conformance

> Exclusivity occurs when the entire expression only excludes.
>
> It is recommended to not use exclusive conformance. Inclusive conformance is recommended.
>
> For example: Excluding an element with "!Matter" means that it is mandatory otherwise. Better to use inclusive conformance with (e.g. "Zigbee"). For example: Excluding an element with "\[!Matter\]" means that it is optional otherwise. Better to use inclusive conformance with (e.g. "\[Zigbee\]").

### Otherwise Conformance

> Otherwise conformance is a list evaluated from top to bottom (see [Quality Conformance](#quality-conformance)), and left to right, where an expression is mutually exclusive to the previous expressions (above and to the left). It is a shorthand that allows defining conformance which depends on the previously evaluated true expression.
>
> Some examples:

- "AB, O" means mandatory for AB and optional otherwise.

- "AB, \[CD\]" means mandatory for AB, optional if CD is true and AB is false, otherwise not allowed.

- "!AB, O" means mandatory if AB is false, otherwise optional (if AB is true).

- "\[AB\], M" is the equivalent to "!AB, O", and a clearer way to define the conformance.

- "\[AA\], \[BB\], \[CC\]" is the equivalent to "\[AA \| BB \| CC\]".

### Quality Conformance

> To support differing quality conformance for an element, the element row is duplicated with the
>
> qualities that differ and the conformance for those qualities. Duplicating the rows requires top to bottom evaluation, similar to left to right evaluation for [Otherwise Conformance](#otherwise-conformance). However, if 2 adjacent rows evaluate to the same conformance (e.g. "AB, O" and "O" when AB is false), then the choice of qualities is optional, if the row element is implemented.
>
> For the example below, the MinLevel element is mandatory for LT with the minimum of 1 (not zero), mandatory for AB with the minimum of 0 (zero), otherwise the element is optional with a minimum of 0 (zero).

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Access** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 43 | MinLevel | uint8 | 1 to 100 | F | R V | 1 | LT |
| 43 | MinLevel | uint8 | 0 to 100 | F | R V | 0 | AB, O |

> For the example below, the MaxLevel element is fixed, read only and mandatory for LT, writeable and mandatory for AB, otherwise the element is optional and access may be read only or writable.

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Access** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 44 | MaxLevel | uint8 | 1 to 100 | F | R V | 100 | LT |
| 44 | MaxLevel | uint8 | 0 to 100 |  | RW VM | 100 | AB, O |
| 44 | MaxLevel | uint8 | 0 to 100 | F | R V | 100 | O |

### Expressions and Optionality

> A conformance expression supports conformance tags as operands. A conformance tag for a cluster MAY be the name of a cluster feature (see [FeatureMap](#featuremap-attribute)). A conformance tag for a cluster MAY be the name of an element in the Name column of the same table. A conformance tag for a device type def­ inition MAY also include a condition of the node.
>
> Expressions SHALL represent a dependency with boolean logic using:

- the NOT operator such as "!AA"

- the OR operator such as “AA \| BB”

- the AND operator such as “AA & BB”

- the XOR (exclusive or) operator such as "AA ^ BB"

- the equal operator such as "AA==10"

- the not equal operator such as "AA!=10"

> Equality operators require that a value can be resolved for the left operand. If the left operand is not supported, the [default](#default-column) is the value. "null" is a valid value for the equality operator.
>
> Simple dependencies MAY also be defined in conformance. If a Max attribute has a dependency on a Min attribute, then the conformance for Max is "Min". Exclusive logic also applies. For example, if the Absolute attribute is mutually exclusive to the Percentage attribute, and one of the two must be
>
> supported, then conformance for Absolute would be "!Percentage", and conformance for Percent­ age would be "!Absolute".
>
> Unless overridden with parentheses, the order of operations is:

- NOT operator "!"

- AND operator "&", OR operator "\|", XOR operator "^"

- equal "==", not equal "!="

> If an expression is false, there SHALL be no assumption of general optionality. If the conformance expression evaluates to false but optional, the expression is false.
>
> Some examples of conformance definitions:

- "\[AB\]" means the element is not allowed, if AB evaluates to false.

- "\[AA & BB\]" means optional if AA and BB are both true, but excluded (and not optional) other­ wise.

- "\[!AA & BB\]" means only optional if AA is false and BB is true.

### Choice Conformance

> Choice conformance defines requirements for implementing a set of elements at the same level. This set of elements is called the choice set.
>
> Choice parameters determine the requirements for a choice set and are added to a conformance expression following a period, for example *C.an+*.
>
> *C* is any logical optional *\[AB\]* conformance expression or optional conformance list, including "O" (optional), but not "M", "X", "D", or "P". If *C* is a conformance list, then the list SHALL be surrounded by parentheses. A conformance list may also include optional choice expressions among others in the list that do not support a choice.
>
> It is invalid to use mandatory conformance for choice such as "M.a", "AB.a+" or "!AB.a-". This gives the reader the false impression that the individual element is mandatory.
>
> The choice parameters are *a*, *n*, "+" (plus sign) and "-" (minus sign):

- *a* is a lower case letter identifying 2 or more elements in the choice set, that SHALL be at the same scope (in the same table).

- *n* determines the number from the choice set that SHALL be supported after evaluation of the conformance *C* and subject to the conditions described below. *n* SHALL only be present as a suf­ fix to a choice set.

> • *+* and *-* serve to limit the number of elements that may be included from the choice set in an implementation and SHALL only be present as a suffix to *n* or to the choice set if *n* is omitted. These choice parameters SHALL NOT appear together in the same conformance designation.
>
> The *n*, *+*, and *-* choice parameters, if present, are interpreted as follows:

- If *n* is omitted, then *n* is considered to be one.

- If *n* appears without a plus ("+") or minus ("-") sign choice parameter, *n* represents the exact number of elements from the choice set that SHALL be included in an implementation. *n* SHALL be between 1 and the number of elements in the choice set minus 1.

- If *n* appears with a plus ("+") sign choice parameter, *n* represents that at least *n* elements of the choice set SHALL be included in an implementation. *n* SHALL be between 1 and the number of elements in the choice set minus 1.

- If *n* appears with a minus ("-") sign choice parameter, *n* represents that at most *n* elements of the choice set SHALL be included in an implementation. *n* SHALL be between 1 and the number of elements in the choice set minus 1.

- *n* can appear as a range, e.g. 2-4, without a trailing plus ("+") or minus ("-") sign, to indicate that the number of elements included in an implementation SHALL be within the indicated range inclusive. The values in the range SHALL be between 1 and the number of elements in the choice set minus 1. If a range is used, trailing choice parameters plus ("+") and minus ("-") SHALL NOT be used.

> When choice conformance notation is used, each element in the choice set SHALL have identical choice parameters.
>
> Invalid example: It is illegal to use "O.a" for one element and "O.a2" for another.
>
> Choice sets SHALL NOT be shared between tables within the same device type or cluster specifica­ tion. For example, if choice set a is used in the Attributes table and a second choice set is used in another table within the cluster specification, the second set must use a different choice set identi­ fier, such as b.
>
> Invalid example: It is illegal to have one attribute marked as O.a in the attributes table and one command marked as O.a in the commands table.
>
> Valid examples:

- "O.a" means exactly one of the "a" elements SHALL be supported.

- "O.a2" means exactly two of the "a" elements SHALL be supported.

- "O.a2+" means at least two of the "a" elements SHALL be supported.

- "O.a+" means at least one of the "a" elements SHALL be supported.

- "O.a2-" means at most two of the "a" elements SHALL be supported.

- "O.a-" means at most one of the "a" elements SHALL be supported.

- "O.a2-4" means 2, 3 or 4 of the "a" elements SHALL be supported.

> Although individual element conformance such as "O.a", "O.a+", "\[AB\].a+" or "\[AB\].a2-4" allows an individual element to be optional, the restrictions on the choice set defined by the choice set para­ meters must be satisfied once the conformance expression is evaluated and an implementation SHALL support a number of elements as allowed by the choice set parameters. This may be a spe­ cific number of elements, or one of a range of possible numbers of elements, depending on the choice set parameters.
>
> For example: The following is valid, because the *n* value of 1 or more is always supported.
>
> If AB is true and CD is false then AbsoluteValue must be supported and optionally PercentValue. If AB is false and CD is true then PercentValue must be supported and optionally AbsoluteValue. If AB is true and CD is true then both elements must be supported. If AB is false and CD is false then either one or both elements must be supported.

| **ID** | **Name**      | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Default** | **Conformance** |
|--------|---------------|----------|----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 43     | AbsoluteValue | uint16   | 0 to 5000      | 0           | AB, O.a1+       |
| 44     | PercentValue  | uint8    | 0 to 100       | 0           | CD, O.a1+       |

> Different expressions for *C* are allowed, which may limit the choices, based on conformance, to greater than zero, but less than *n*. In such cases, consideration is needed to define the choices and conformance so that the *n* value is satisfied in every valid combination.
>
> For example: The following is invalid if conformance allows AB to be false and CD to be true, because the *n* value of 2 is not satisfied.

| **ID** | **Name**   | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Default** | **Conformance** |
|--------|------------|----------|----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 43     | AbsoluteCm | uint16   | 0 to 5000      | 0           | \[AB & CM\].a2  |
| 44     | AbsoluteIn | uint16   | 0 to 2000      | 0           | \[AB & IN\].a2  |
| 45     | Percent    | uint8    | 0 to 100       | 0           | \[CD\].a2       |

### Blank Conformance

> If an element does not have a designated conformance (the column is blank or omitted), then it SHALL inherit conformance from the next highest element in the model hierarchy. For example: A data field in a struct attribute inherits its conformance from the attribute.

### Feature Conformance

> The above examples use (all capitalized) cluster feature codes in conformance expressions.
>
> If a feature table has no conformance column then each feature is considered to be optional for that revision and therefore either true (feature supported) or false (feature unsupported).
>
> If a feature table has a Conformance column then these are the allowed conformance:

| **Conformance** | **Feature** | **Meaning** |
|----|----|----|
| M | true | This means the feature is now mandatory, and the confor­ mance expression is true, and the feature supported (true). |

| **Conformance** | **Feature** | **Meaning** |
|----|----|:---|
| O | *implementation* | This is the default conformance (if blank), which means the fea­ ture support is indicated by the implementation (true or false). |
| D | false | The conformance expression is false, and the feature is unsup­ ported (false). A legacy imple­ mentation may still support the feature with a true value. |
| X | false | This is used in a device type that overrides cluster specifica­ tion conformance, which means the conformance expression is false, and the feature is unsup­ ported (false). |
| P | false | This means the conformance expression is false, and the fea­ ture is provisional and unsup­ ported. |
| *false mandatory expression* | false | Conformance expressions are used to define more complex feature dependencies. A list of expressions evaluates to a sin­ gle expression. Choice options only support optional expres­ sions. |
| *false optional expression* | false |  |
| *true mandatory expression* | true |  |
| *true optional expression* | *implementation* |  |

- If the feature indicator (bit) is unsupported, then the feature indicator SHALL be false and the feature SHALL be unsupported (false).

- Otherwise, if the conformance expression evaluates to false, then the feature indicator SHALL be false and the feature SHALL be unsupported (false).

- Otherwise, if the conformance expression evaluates to mandatory, then the feature indicator and feature support SHALL be the value of the conformance expression.

- Otherwise:

  - the feature support (true or false) SHALL be the value or the feature indicator (bit) as imple­ mented.

  - If the conformance expression evaluates to a [choice conformance](#choice-conformance), then the indicators for the choice set SHALL also conform to the choice parameters.

## Element

> An element of the data model is a data construct that supports an instance of data. Listed below are
>
> the elements of the data model.

#### First order elements

> fabric, node, endpoint, cluster

#### Cluster first order elements

> command, event, attribute

#### Nested elements

> command field, event field, struct field

#### Dynamic element

> list entry

#### Semantic elements

> device type, data type

#### Attribute data

> elements (above) that are part of an attribute

#### Data field

> attribute, field element, or list entry (see [Data Field](#data-field-2))

### Encoded Element Processing

> When parsing or processing encoded payloads of elements as represented by an encoding layer, such as [TLV format](#appendix-a-tag-length-value-tlv-encoding-format), the following general rules apply:

- Unknown elements SHALL be ignored and skipped. This provides forward compatibility with future elements.

- Elements SHALL be present when conveyed according to the element’s conformance.

- Elements that are present and conformant SHALL be processed.

## Fabric

> A fabric is a set of nodes that interact by accessing data model elements as defined in the [Interac­](#chapter-8.-interaction-model-specification) [tion Model](#chapter-8.-interaction-model-specification). A fabric is a security domain that allows a set of nodes to be identified and communi­ cate within the context of the domain. A node is considered to be 'on' a fabric, when it can be identi­ fied and interact in the context of that fabric. An interaction is considered to occur 'on' a fabric, when the interaction occurs in the context of that fabric (see [Accessing Fabric](#accessing-fabric)). Each interaction occurs either on a single fabric, or without a fabric context (see [Accessing Fabric](#accessing-fabric)).
>
> A node MAY be identified and interact on one or more fabrics.
>
> How a fabric is established and how a node comes to be on a fabric is not defined here and left to the lower layers.

### Accessing Fabric

> If an interaction is associated with a particular fabric, that fabric is called the "accessing fabric".
>
> If the interaction is not associated with a fabric, the accessing fabric does not exist. In this case any comparison of the accessing fabric to any existing fabric SHALL consider them not equal.

### Fabric-Index

> Each fabric supported on a node is referenced by [fabric-index](#fabric-index-type) that is unique on the node. This fab­ ric-index enables the look-up of the full fabric information from the fabric-index. A fabric-index of 0 (zero) or null SHALL indicate that there is no fabric associated with the context in which the fab­ ric-index is being used. If fabric-index is used in a context that is exclusively associated with a fab­ ric, such as fabric-scoped data model elements, then the fabric-index values SHALL NOT include 0 (zero) or null.
>
> The fabric-index corresponding to the [accessing fabric](#accessing-fabric) is called the "accessing fabric-index". If the accessing fabric does not exist, the accessing fabric-index SHALL indicate no fabric with a fabric- index of 0.

### Fabric-Scoped Data

> Most cluster data instances are accessible regardless of the accessing fabric. However, data that is exclusively associated with a particular fabric SHALL be defined as being fabric-scoped. Fabric- scoped data SHALL be defined with the [fabric-scoped quality](#fabric-scoped-quality).
>
> The fabric associated with fabric-scoped data is called the "associated fabric".
>
> Fabric-scoped data allows multiple accessing fabrics to manipulate a list of data items without interfering with each other. See [Fabric Filtered List](#_bookmark802).
>
> Fabric-scoped data SHALL be limited to the following:

- [list of fabric-scoped structs](#_bookmark801), which MAY include fabric-sensitive fields

- [fabric-sensitive event](#fabric-sensitive-event)

> A fabric-scoped data instance is always a composite struct-like data instance, with multiple fields.
>
> Fabric-scoped data SHALL always include the [FabricIndex field](#fabricindex-field) to indicate the associated fabric. The [FabricIndex field](#fabricindex-field) for fabric-scoped data SHALL NOT be 0 or null.
>
> Any interaction, including cluster commands, SHALL NOT cause modification of fabric-scoped data, directly or indirectly, if the interaction has an [accessing fabric](#accessing-fabric) different than the [associated fabric](#_bookmark693) for the data, except in the case of a cluster command that explicitly defines an exception to this rule.
>
> Data fields in a fabric-scoped struct MAY also have the [fabric-sensitive quality](#fabric-sensitive-quality).

### Fabric-Scoped IDs

> Some data types are fabric-scoped IDs, including, but not limited to, node ID and group ID.
>
> A fabric-scoped ID MAY require the presence of a [fabric-index](#fabric-index-type) data type field within the same nest­ ing scope to indicate the fabric associated with the ID in these cases:

- If the fabric-scoped ID is not part of fabric-scoped data.

- If the fabric-scoped ID is part of fabric-scoped data with an associated fabric that is not the fab­ ric associated with the ID.

> Fabric-scoped IDs SHALL only be indicated in these elements:

- [structs](#struct-type)

- [events](#event)

- [commands](#command)

> Where necessary, specification text SHOULD define the data to which the [fabric-index](#fabric-index-type) applies.

## Access

> Data model elements have access qualities. Some elements have intrinsic access or access limita­ tions. For example: Cluster commands or command fields are not writable.
>
> An Access column defines access to a data model element or set of elements. This column is valid for attributes, commands, events, and nested attribute data fields.

| **Access Column** | **Description** |
|----|----|
| **R** | [Read Access](#read-access) |
| **W** | [Write Access](#write-access) |
| **R\[W\]** | [Read Access](#read-access) and optionally [Write Access](#write-access) |
| **R\*W** | Deprecated: use R\[W\] |
| Privileges - separate with space |  |
| **V** | [Read Access](#read-access) or [Invoke Access](#invoke-access) requires View privilege |
| **O** | [Read Access](#read-access), [Write Access](#write-access), or [Invoke Access](#invoke-access) requires Operate privilege |
| **M** | [Read Access](#read-access), [Write Access](#write-access), or [Invoke Access](#invoke-access) requires Manage privilege |
| **A** | [Read Access](#read-access), [Write Access](#write-access), or [Invoke Access](#invoke-access) requires Administer privilege |
| Fabric - separate with space |  |
| **F** | [Fabric-Scoped Quality](#fabric-scoped-quality) |

| **Access Column** | **Description** |
|----|----|
| **S** | [Fabric-Sensitive Quality](#fabric-sensitive-quality) |
| Timed - separate with space |  |
| **T** | [Write Access](#write-access) or [Invoke Access](#invoke-access) with timed inter­ action only |

> Attributes, commands, and events SHALL define their access, and SHALL include privileges in their access definition. For example: An attribute defines whether it is readable or writable, and what privileges are required to do so.
>
> Attributes, commands, and events that do not define any privileges as access qualities SHALL be deemed to have the following:

- View privilege required for Read access,

- Operate privilege required for Write access,

- Operate privilege required for Invoke access for request commands.

- No privileges defined for response commands.

> For example: An event with implicit read access or explicit 'R' access defaults to access 'R V'. An attribute with access 'RW' defaults to access 'RW VO'. A request command with implicit invoke access defaults to privilege 'O'.
>
> Nested elements MAY define their access, but SHALL NOT include privileges in their access defini­ tion. Nested elements SHALL inherit their privileges from the next highest element in the model hierarchy. Nested elements that do not define their access SHALL inherit their access from the next highest element in the model hierarchy. For example: A data field in a struct attribute inherits its access qualities from attribute.
>
> Elements SHALL only include the lowest required privilege for a type of access. That means:

- An event SHALL define the single privilege required for Read access.

- A command SHALL define the single privilege required for Invoke access.

- A readable attribute SHALL define the single privilege required for Read access.

- A writable (but not readable) attribute SHALL define the single privilege (that is not View or ProxyView) required for Write access.

- A readable and writable attribute MAY define a single privilege (that is not View or ProxyView) required for both Read and Write access.

- A readable and writable attribute MAY define the View or ProxyView privilege as required for Read access and one other privilege (that is not View or ProxyView) as required for Write access.

### Read Access

> Read access means that a request for data values associated with an element SHALL be supported. This quality SHALL only be defined for cluster event and attribute data definitions. This quality SHALL NOT be defined for cluster command definitions.
>
> This quality is implicitly defined for cluster events and does not need to be stipulated explicitly.

### Write Access

> Write access means that a request to modify attribute data values SHALL be supported. This quality SHALL only be defined for cluster attribute data definitions. This quality SHALL NOT be defined for cluster event and command definitions.
>
> A cluster specification SHALL define the conditions when write access attribute data is not writable, and SHALL define normative or recommended behavior to follow when this occurs.
>
> An implementation that does not support write access for a field with optional write access SHALL have this declared in its product Declaration of Conformity.

### Invoke Access

> Invoke access means that a request to execute a command SHALL be supported. This quality SHALL only be defined for cluster command definitions, by defining an appropriate privilege level for the command. This quality SHALL NOT be defined for cluster event and attribute data definitions.

### Fabric-Scoped Quality

> This defines [fabric-scoped data](#fabric-scoped-data) that is scoped to an [associated fabric](#_bookmark693).
>
> This quality acts as an additional constraint over those imposed by the existing Read and Write qualities, namely:

- Fabric-scoped attribute data SHALL NOT be writable unless the [accessing fabric](#accessing-fabric) is the [associ­](#_bookmark693) [ated fabric](#_bookmark693) of the data.

- A cluster command SHALL NOT alter fabric-scoped data if the [associated fabric](#_bookmark693) is not the [accessing fabric](#accessing-fabric).

### Fabric-Sensitive Quality

> This further restricts access to data that is sensitive to the [associated fabric](#_bookmark693).
>
> This quality acts as an additional constraint over those imposed by the fabric-scoped quality, namely:

- Fabric-sensitive data SHALL NOT be readable unless the [accessing fabric](#accessing-fabric) is the [associated fabric](#_bookmark693) of the data. See [fabric-scoped data](#fabric-scoped-data).

> Data that is fabric-sensitive SHALL always be fabric-scoped.
>
> Only [event definitions](#fabric-sensitive-event) and the fields of a fabric-scoped struct MAY be fabric-sensitive.

### View Privilege

> An element with the View privilege SHALL support Read (if readable) and Invoke (if invocable) access if the source of the request is granted the View privilege.
>
> A command with the View privilege defined SHALL NOT alter data that is part of its function (e.g. settings, configuration), but MAY alter data that is internal or diagnostic in nature (e.g. usage statis­ tics).

### Operate Privilege

> An element with the Operate privilege defined SHALL support Read (if readable), Write (if writable), and Invoke (if invocable) access if the source of the request is granted the Operate privi­ lege.

### Manage Privilege

> An element with the Manage privilege defined SHALL support Read (if readable), Write (if writable), and Invoke (if invocable) access if the source of the request is granted the Manage privi­ lege.

### Administer Privilege

> An element with the Administer privilege defined SHALL support Read (if readable), Write (if writable), and Invoke (if invocable) access if the source of the request is granted the Administer privilege.

### Timed Interaction

> This quality requires the use of a timed interaction.
>
> Timed interactions are used to limit the amount of time an action message is valid and can interact with a node. They are used to prevent a timing attack on the system. For example, a malicious attacker could perform an "intercept, interfere, and replay" procedure whereby a legitimate mes­ sage is intercepted, receipt by the intended destination is jammed, and the attacker sends the mes­ sage at a later time to cause a malicious action such as unlocking a door at an unintended time. While the practical difficulties of such an attack are high, and the malicious eavesdropper cannot decrypt the action message, the timed interaction provides further mitigation of risk for critical actions.
>
> The timed interaction can be thought of as a 2-phase commit. A precursor action ([Timed Request](#timed-request-action) [Action](#timed-request-action)) is sent to indicate the valid time window for arrival of some subsequent, primary action. Since the timed request requires a response, an attacker cannot do the store-and-forward timing attack anymore. The lack of an authenticated response from the intended destination will prevent the subsequent primary action from being sent.
>
> A command with this quality SHALL require a timed invoke interaction. A writable attribute with
>
> this quality SHALL require a timed write interaction.
>
> An attempted untimed write interaction to a writable attribute with this quality SHALL generate an error response.
>
> An untimed invoke interaction for a request command with this quality SHALL generate an error response.

## Other Qualities

> A Quality column defines other qualities not covered in other columns. Some qualities are limited to a specific set of elements. If an element does not have designated qualities, then it SHALL inherit qualities from the next highest element in the model hierarchy. For example: A data field in a struct attribute inherits its access qualities from attribute.

| **Quality Column** | **Name** | **Elements** | **Description** |
|----|----|----|----|
| C | Changes Omitted | attribute data | Fast changing data or data where deltas are meaningless to report, and which will not cause delta changes on subscriptions |
| F | Fixed | attribute data | The read only value is a fixed value that never changes, unless the program image changes |
| I | Singleton | cluster | The cluster is a single­ ton on the node for the device type |
| K | Diagnostics | cluster | The cluster is a verbose diagnostics cluster, which could be omitted from wildcard expan­ sion |
| L | Large Message | command | The command payload can be large, resulting in the message exceed­ ing the minimum IPv6 MTU of 1280 bytes. |
| N | Non-Volatile | attribute data | The attribute data value is non-volatile and is [persistent](#persistence) across restarts |

| **Quality Column** | **Name** | **Elements** | **Description** |
|----|----|----|----|
| P | Reportable | attribute | If best effort reporting is supported then the attribute supports a reporting configuration |
| Q | Quieter Reporting | attribute data | Data with fluctuating data rate or where some deltas are mean­ ingless or undesirable to report. |
| S | Scene | attribute | The attribute is part of a scene |
| T | Atomic | attribute | The attribute requires writes to be part of an atomic interaction |
| X | Nullable | data fields | The [data type](#data-types) of the data field is [nullable](#nullable) |

### Changes Omitted Quality

> This quality MAY be given to attribute data that is deemed to have a high rate of change or where changes are not meaningful or too large to convey as part of [Subscribe interaction](#subscribe-interaction).
>
> Attribute data with this quality SHALL support [Read Access](#read-access), but SHALL NOT have delta changes published as part of a [Subscribe interaction](#subscribe-interaction).

### Fixed Quality

> Data with this quality is read only and has a fixed value that never changes, unless the program image changes.

### Singleton Quality

> This quality indicates that a cluster is a singleton on the node, representing the entire node.

### Diagnostics Quality

> This quality is given to Clusters which contain very large amounts of seldom-consulted attributes.
>
> Such a cluster SHALL be omitted from [Request Path Expansion](#request-path-expansion) when the WildcardSkipDiagnostic­ sClusters bit in [WildcardPathFlags](#wildcardpathflagsbitmap) is set.

### Large Message Quality

> Command messages with this quality are typically larger than the minimum IPv6 MTU of 1280 bytes and cannot be transported over [MRP](#message-reliability-protocol-mrp). They SHALL require [TCP](#secure-communications-over-tcp) for communication.

### Non-Volatile Quality

> See [Persistence](#persistence).

### Reportable Quality

> The [Subscribe interaction](#subscribe-interaction) supports all attribute data. This quality is supported by other interactions that only require attribute data with this quality to support interval or change reporting.

### Quieter Reporting Quality

> This quality MAY be given to attribute data that changes in a way where some of the changes are considered to have a high rate of change or where changes are not meaningful or desirable to report.
>
> This quality can be used for fast changing attributes, where the majority of reports would have lit­ tle to no value for the client (e.g. the continuous countdown of a timer in the server where the client can have a local digital twin) but where some reports may be important to synchronize the local twin, (e.g. when a countdown starts, stops or is changed). Another case where this quality can be used is for attributes that can change value for a long period (e.g. the CurrentLevel of a light per­ forming a ramp with a long transition time) or where the measured value can change quite often. This prevents over-reporting of such an attribute to many subscribed clients which could lead to link degradation on bandwidth-constrained links.
>
> Attributes with this quality SHALL specify, in the attribute description, the details of the conditions under which changes to the attribute value SHALL, SHOULD or MAY be reported.
>
> Changes to the value under conditions other than those specified in the attribute description SHOULD NOT be reported. To ensure clients can understand the parameters related to specifics of that attribute’s reporting, the description MAY include details regarding when the attribute value might change without being reported.
>
> Attributes MAY get this quality assigned in a revision of a cluster, to limit the amount of reporting, therefore Clients SHALL generally be resilient to more reporting than constrained by the attribute description, from older revisions of the cluster.
>
> Attribute data with this quality SHALL support [Read Access](#read-access).

### Scene Quality

> This quality is supported and described in the Scenes Management cluster. It relates to the ability of a field to be settable by Scenes. This quality SHALL only apply to attributes having unsigned integer or boolean data types of size at most 4 bytes from the Base Data Types list (e.g. bool, uint8, uint16, uint32), or derived types thereof (e.g. enum8, map8). This quality has no effect in contexts unrelated to the Scenes Management cluster.

### Nullable Quality

> See [Nullable](#nullable).

### Atomic Quality

> This quality indicates that an attribute requires atomic writes. See [Atomic Writes](#atomic-writes). An attribute with this quality SHALL support [Write Access](#write-access).

## Node

> A Node encapsulates an addressable, unique resource on the network that has a set of functions and capabilities that a user recognizes distinctly as a functional whole.
>
> This distinction is usually physical, such as the physical device itself, or a logical instance of a physi­ cal device.
>
> A node is the highest or outermost first order element in the data model. A node is the outermost unique addressable element of the data model.
>
> A node MAY have multiple node IDs, each ID scoped to a particular fabric. When a node ID is used as the target address of an interaction, the fabric under which the node ID is scoped, is the [access­](#accessing-fabric) [ing fabric](#accessing-fabric) for the interaction.
>
> The lower layers in a communication stack supporting this data model SHALL support interactions between nodes on a logical inter-network of nodes. Please see the [Interaction Model](#chapter-8.-interaction-model-specification) and [System](#chapter-9.-system-model-specification) [Model](#chapter-9.-system-model-specification) specifications that describe relationships and interactions between nodes and data model elements on each node.
>
> It is possible for parts of a node to reside on different processors (e.g. separate application and net­ work processors).
>
> A single physical product may support more than one node.

## Endpoint

> A node is composed of one or more endpoints. An endpoint is an instance of something that could be a service or virtual device as indicated by a [device type](#device-type).
>
> Each endpoint conforms to one or more [device type](#device-type) definitions that define the clusters supported on the endpoint. Clusters are object classes that are instantiated on an endpoint.
>
> The word 'device', depending on the context, may be used as shorthand to denote the device type definition as represented by a device type ID, a device type implementation, or an endpoint (device type instance).
>
> There are also many examples in specification text where 'device' is used, when it would be better, and more accurate to use 'node', 'physical device', or 'product'.
>
> The word 'device' may also be used in cluster specifications to describe application software that is supporting an instance of a cluster server or client. In this case, it would be better, and more accu­ rate to use either 'client' or 'server'.
>
> One must be careful to make sure there is no ambiguity when using the word 'device' in specifica­ tion text, or better yet, use another word.

## Cluster

> Clusters are the functional building block elements of the data model. A cluster specification defines both a client and server side that correspond with each other through interactions. A clus­ ter may be considered an interface, service, or object class and is the lowest independent functional element in the data model. Each cluster is defined by a cluster specification that defines elements of a cluster including attributes, events, commands, as well as behavior associated with interactions with these elements. Cluster attributes, events, commands and behaviors are mandatory or optional depending on the definition of the cluster. Optional items may have dependencies.
>
> A cluster specification SHALL list one or more Cluster Identifiers. A Cluster Identifier SHALL refer­ ence a single cluster specification and SHALL define conformance to that specification. A cluster instance SHALL be indicated and discovered by a Cluster Identifier on an endpoint. A Cluster Iden­ tifier also defines the purpose of the instance.
>
> The server cluster supports attribute data, events and cluster commands. The client cluster initiates interactions, including invocation of cluster commands.

### Cluster Revision

> The revision of a cluster is to enforce backward and forward compatibility, but still allow clusters to be enhanced, fixed, or updated, without changing the cluster’s basic function.
>
> A cluster revision SHALL be associated with an approved revision and release of a cluster specifica­ tion. The revision of an instance of a cluster SHALL be represented by the global, mandatory, and read only ClusterRevision attribute. Please see ClusterRevision attribute.
>
> Changes to a cluster specification SHALL only augment, not modify the primary function of the cluster. Changes to a cluster specification SHALL be represented by incrementing the cluster revi­ sion. New revisions of a client cluster SHALL interoperate with older revisions of the server cluster and vice versa. Interoperability between corresponding cluster instances MAY require reading the cluster revision.

[TABLE]

[TABLE]

### Cluster Optional Features

> In general, as the number of optional elements in a cluster specification increases, the number of possible combinations increases, which could decrease the interoperability of that cluster.
>
> Each cluster has a mandatory feature set that consists of mandatory elements such as attributes, commands, fields, values, dependencies, behavior, etc.
>
> A cluster specification MAY have optional feature sets, each supported by a set of elements (see [Fea­](#featuremap-attribute) [tureMap](#featuremap-attribute)).
>
> There is no requirement that each cluster instance supports the same set of optional elements.
>
> If an application knows the ClusterRevision and FeatureMap supported by a cluster instance, then it knows the exact specification text required to be implemented by that instance.

### Cluster Data Version

> A cluster data version is a metadata increment-only counter value, maintained for each cluster instance. A cluster data version represents an exact & coherent state of cluster attribute data at present. An application may externally hold a data version (called a held data version) published by a cluster instance which then represents a cluster instance state at some time in the past. An appli­ cation may use a held data version to optimize future interactions, by indicating the held data ver­ sion. A cluster data version is surfaced in the [Interaction Model](#chapter-8.-interaction-model-specification) when data is requested. It is used to optimize data [read](#read-access) transactions by reducing the need to send the same data. Write interactions may also be qualified with a held data version to disallow changes, unless the cluster instance has the same data version (see [Interaction Model](#chapter-8.-interaction-model-specification)). A cluster data version is published as information in some interactions (See [Interaction Model](#chapter-8.-interaction-model-specification)). An externally held data version may be included as information in some interactions (See [Interaction Model](#chapter-8.-interaction-model-specification)).
>
> A cluster data version SHALL increment or be set (wrap) to zero if incrementing would exceed its maximum value. A cluster data version SHALL be maintained for each cluster instance. A cluster data version SHALL be initialized randomly when it is first published. A cluster data version SHALL be incremented if any attribute data changes.

### New Cluster

> When considering the creation of a new cluster specification, it is recommended to consider
>
> reusing and extending an existing cluster specification. These are the mechanisms to consider, in order, to extend a cluster:

1.  Optional elements: attribute data, commands, events, enumerations, etc.

2.  Optional feature(s) in the [FeatureMap](#featuremap-attribute) attribute for a set of elements (see 1)

3.  [Cluster Aliasing](#cluster-aliasing) to reuse a cluster specification as a whole, but with a different semantic

4.  [Cluster Inheritance](#cluster-inheritance)

5.  A new cluster specification

### Cluster Aliasing

> Cluster aliasing allows the reuse of approved and validated specifications and derived documents, such as test plans, scripts, etc.

- More than one Cluster Identifier, each with unique purpose and semantic content, MAY map to a single cluster specification.

[TABLE]

### Cluster Inheritance

> Cluster inheritance allows the reuse of approved and validated specifications and derived docu­ ments, such as test plans, scripts, etc. This allows a new cluster specification to be defined as extending or reducing the requirements of an existing cluster specification, called the base cluster. This also allows an existing cluster specification to be defined as a derived cluster, by creating a new base cluster that is more generic, allowing potential new clusters to be derived from the new base cluster.

- A derived cluster specification MAY have mandatory requirements that are optional in the base specification.

- A derived cluster specification MAY remove requirements that are optional in the base specifi­ cation.

- A derived cluster specification MAY remove or make optional a requirement that is mandatory in the base specification, if the resulting specification is deemed useful in its reduced form, and logically a subset of the base clusters.

[TABLE]

- It is RECOMMENDED that a derived cluster makes changes to the base cluster by extending or

> reducing one or more features or independent elements, and not by modifying features, ele­ ments or cluster behavior.
>
> Such modifications SHOULD be defined as a feature, which can be used to extend or reduce.

- All new features, elements or behavior introduced by the derived cluster that may be useful across other derivations SHOULD be defined in the base cluster specification and made optional (in that base cluster specification), to maintain the entire set of requirements and identifier namespace in one place.

- A range of ID values SHALL be reserved for the base clusters. The remaining values SHALL be reserved for use by the derived clusters. The ranges reserved for base clusters are as follows:

  - Feature bits: 0-19

  - Attribute IDs: 0x0000-0x7FFF

  - Command IDs: 0x00-0x7F

  - Event IDs: 0x00-0x7F

- A derived cluster specification SHALL define its own revision (ClusterRevision attribute) that is independent of the base specification, with the single exception that if the base specification is modified/updated in a way that requires its revision to be increased, as detailed in [Cluster Revi­](#cluster-revision) [sion](#cluster-revision), then the revision of any derived cluster specifications SHALL also be increased.

- A base cluster specification MAY be created from an original base cluster, which then becomes a derived cluster to the newly created base cluster.

> If an endpoint supports multiple server clusters that derive or map to the same base cluster specifi­ cation, then each SHALL represent a single implementation and operate as a single entity or instance. This makes it possible to deploy a new device endpoint with both a base and a derived cluster identifier, which SHALL remain backward compatible to legacy devices that support only the original cluster identifier. Cluster identifiers that are mapped to a single base cluster specifica­ tion, but are defined for distinctly different purposes, MAY exist together on a device endpoint. If there is no base cluster identifier defined, or no base cluster identifier exists on the same endpoint, then each cluster identifier SHALL represent a separate instance.
>
> It is a good practice to explore the possibility of either deriving a cluster from an existing cluster or creating a base cluster to map or derive new and existing cluster identifiers. See [New Cluster](#new-cluster) for other options.

### Status Codes

> A cluster specification defines status code responses to actions depending on the cluster instance state. A status code is either a [global Interaction Model status code](#status-code-table), or a cluster specific status code that is unique to the cluster specification. A global status code is either scoped to the entire action, or to a cluster request path. A cluster specific status code scoped to a cluster instance is indicated by a cluster path. When an interaction defines a Status Response response, the responder SHALL return a global Interaction Model status code. When an interaction response needs to communicate a cluster specific status code, the responder SHALL return the path to the cluster instance, the global status code SUCCESS or FAILURE, and the cluster specific status code. Each cluster specific status code SHALL be associated with either SUCCESS or FAILURE, not both. A cluster specific status
>
> code SHALL be, by default, associated with FAILURE unless it is defined as associated with SUCCESS. The global SUCCESS status code means the action was executed for the request path; the global FAILURE status code means that it was not executed.

- Cluster-specific status code SHALL be defined using the [status](#status-code-type) type.

- Cluster-specific status codes MAY have the same numeric values as global status codes. Interac­ tion model messages SHALL make it clear whether a particular message field is a global status code or a cluster-specific status code.

- Cluster-specific status codes SHALL communicate more information than just a generic success or failure condition. Global status codes SHALL be used to communicate such conditions.

- A server cluster SHALL NOT return a cluster-specific code from another cluster.

### Cluster Classification

> A cluster SHALL be defined as either a utility cluster or an application cluster.

#### Utility Cluster

> A utility cluster is not part of the primary application operation of an endpoint. It may be used for configuration, discovery, addressing, diagnostics, monitoring device health, software update, etc. It may have a temporary relationship with its cluster counterpart.

[TABLE]

#### Application Cluster

> An application cluster supports the primary operation of the endpoint. An application cluster sup­ ports one or more persistent application interactions between client and server.

[TABLE]

> An application cluster is not a utility cluster even though it may support utility functions for itself, such as calibration, modes of operation, etc. An application cluster specification SHALL be agnostic about layers and processes outside of its application domain.

[TABLE]

[TABLE]

## Command

> A cluster command is a set of [data fields](#data-field-2), each of a [data type](#data-types) that is conveyed between client and server cluster instances to invoke a behavior on the receiver of the command.
>
> Each command SHALL be listed in a table with [data quality](#data-qualities) columns: ID, Name, Direction, Response, Access, Conformance.
>
> The command table SHALL define the direction of the command as either client to server or server to client. The command table SHALL define the access privileges for each request command or omit the privileges for the default (see [default access privileges](#_bookmark697)). The command table SHALL NOT define privileges for a response command. The command table SHALL define a possible response to the command, if any. The command table SHALL define conformance for each command.
>
> A command that is not a response (in the Response column) is a request command. Conformance for a client to server command means the server SHALL recognize and support the client to server command and generate responses as defined. Conformance for a server to client command means the server SHALL send the command as cluster behavior defines, such as in response to a client to server command. Conformance for a command can depend on supported server features. A client SHALL NOT be required to support optional commands or commands depending on an optional feature.
>
> A command description SHALL define when a command is generated. A command description SHALL define the effect upon receipt of a command which may be:

- a response command

- a success status response

- an error status response

- no response

> A command definition SHALL clearly define any side-effects on fabric-scoped data, if applicable. A command is identified and indicated with a command ID that SHALL be unique to the cluster^(\*).

[TABLE]

> A cluster command table SHALL have a Response column with the following values:

| **Response Column** | **Description**                          |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|
| N                   | no response is returned for this command |
| Y                   | status only is returned for this command |

| **Response Column** | **Description**                               |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| *command*           | name of the response command to this com­ mand |

> A cluster command table SHALL have a Direction column with the following values:

| **Direction Column** | **Description** |
|----|----|
| client ⇒ server | command is conveyed from the client to the server cluster |
| client ⇐ server | command is conveyed from the server to the client cluster |

> Each command SHALL be described in its own section with a table defining command fields (if any).

### 7.11.1. Command Fields

> A command MAY indicate zero or more fields that are defined in a table. Each command field is defined as a row in the table with these columns:

| **Column**  | **Description**                                   |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| ID          | This is the unique field ID of the field          |
| Name        | This is the unique name of the field              |
| Type        | This is the [data type](#data-types) of the field |
| Constraint  | see [Constraint](#constraint)                     |
| Quality     | see [qualities](#other-qualities)                 |
| Default     | see [Default](#default-column)                    |
| Conformance | see [Conformance](#conformance)                   |

> Command field conformance defines the sender requirements to include the field in a well-formed command for the revision of the cluster. A new command field or a newly made-mandatory com­ mand field in a newly revised cluster specification may be omitted by a legacy sender. The cluster specification SHALL define clear behavior upon receipt of any possible well-formed command with fields that are not present. The cluster specification SHALL take into consideration the revision his­ tory of possible well-formed commands from legacy implementations. To allow deprecation, it is recommended that command fields have a well-defined default value (such as null), and associated default behavior, that is equivalent to omitting the field. Well-defined behavior, for a field that is not present, may be no behavior at all.

[TABLE]

[TABLE]

## Attribute

> An attribute is cluster data. Each attribute SHALL be listed in a table with [data quality](#data-qualities) columns: ID, Name, (Data) Type, Constraint, other Quality, Access, Default (value), and Conformance. An attribute SHALL also define its associated semantics and behavior. Attributes reflect queryable/set­ table state, configuration and capabilities of a device. If no privileges are explicitly defined for an attribute, then [default access privileges](#_bookmark697) take effect. Attribute data MAY also have these other quali­ ties:

| **Quality** | **Short** | **Description** |
|----|----|----|
| **Scene** | S | indicates that the data is part of a scene |
| **Persistent** | N | indicates that the data value is persistent across restarts |
| **Fixed** | F | indicates that the read only data value will never change |
| **Nullable** | X | indicates that the data may have a value of null |
| **Atomic** | T | indicates that the attribute may only be written to in the context of an atomic write |

> Fabric-scoped attribute data SHALL be defined as a [fabric-scoped list](#_bookmark801).

### Persistence

> Persistent data retains its value across a restart. A restart is:

- a program restart or reboot

- power cycle reboot

- user-initiated reboot

- reboot initiated from a program image upgrade

> A factory reset is not such a restart. A factory reset is a deliberate behavior to reset persistent data back to its original state when the product left the factory.
>
> Cluster attributes that represent configuration data SHALL be persistent data unless otherwise
>
> specified.

[TABLE]

> Many clusters define persistent data that is not surfaced as attributes, but is managed by com­ mands. Commissioning or configuration data that is created to allow the cluster to perform its func­ tion is persistent data. A group table entry and binding entries are both persistent data across a restart.
>
> When a persistent cluster attribute represents controlled state of the device, the device SHALL restore the attribute value to the value before the restart was initiated, and put the device in the state that is represented by the restored value.

[TABLE]

> Some cluster specifications add a dependency with a persistent configuration attribute A that con­ tains a value to use to restore persistent state attribute B after a restart. This is perfectly valid but cluster specific.
>
> Cluster state data that is not controlled, such as sensor data, is not considered persistent. The cluster specification may put dependencies and limitations on persistent data.

## Global Elements

> Below is a list of global elements. These are used for self-description of the server.
>
> *Table 72. Global Attributes*

[TABLE]

[TABLE]

> *Table 73. Global Fields*

> *Table 74. Global Commands*

| **ID** | **Name** | **Direction** | **Response** | **Access** | **Conformance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0xFE | **AtomicRe­ quest** | client ⇒ server | AtomicRe­ sponse | O | desc |
| 0xFD | **AtomicRe­ sponse** | client ⇐ server | N |  | AtomicRequest |

### ClusterRevision Attribute

> The ClusterRevision attribute indicates the revision of the server cluster specification supported by the cluster instance. An implementation of a cluster specification before the ClusterRevision attribute was added SHALL have an assumed cluster revision of 0 (zero). For a new cluster specifi­ cation, the initial value for the ClusterRevision attribute SHALL be 1 (not zero).
>
> A history of revision numbers for a cluster specification release is listed in the Revision History sec­ tion for a cluster specification. Each new revision of a cluster specification SHALL specify a new revision number incremented (by 1) from the last. The highest revision number in a cluster specifi­ cation’s Revision History is the revision number for the cluster specification. Therefore, a Cluster­ Revision attribute value SHALL be the (highest) revision number of the cluster specification that has been implemented.

### FeatureMap Attribute

> Each instance of a cluster SHALL support this attribute.
>
> The FeatureMap attribute SHALL indicate whether the server supports zero or more optional clus­ ter features. A cluster feature is a set of cluster elements that are mandatory or optional for a defined feature of the cluster. If a cluster feature is supported by the cluster instance, then the cor­ responding bit SHALL be set to 1, otherwise the bit SHALL be set to 0 (zero). All undefined bits in
>
> this attribute SHALL be set to 0 (zero).
>
> The set of cluster elements that are designated as mandatory (M) are implicitly part of the manda­ tory cluster feature set, and do not have a bit in the FeatureMap attribute.
>
> A cluster specification SHALL support this attribute if the cluster supports features. If a cluster specification is revised to support features (and so this attribute), each bit in the FeatureMap attribute SHALL have a defined default value (1 or 0), to conform with the previous revision of the cluster specification, that did not support the FeatureMap attribute. The value of 1 means the fea­ ture elements were mandatory (M) in the previous revision. The value of 0 (zero) means the ele­ ments were optional in the previous revision.
>
> Any newly created feature set of a cluster SHALL be dependent on that cluster.
>
> Feature sets are revision controlled as part of a cluster using the ClusterRevision attribute. The clus­ ter specification is the independent element that is revision controlled. A remote application read­ ing the [FeatureMap](#featuremap-attribute) and [ClusterRevision Attribute](#clusterrevision-attribute) will then know exactly what features are sup­ ported in the cluster instance.
>
> Each feature set SHALL be well defined within the cluster specification. Each feature SHALL be mapped to a short capitalized code name for the feature set to be referenced as a [conformance tag](#conformance) in the cluster specification text, including the Conformance columns defining the elements of the cluster.
>
> If a cluster defines more than 32 feature sets, then it will be necessary to add another feature bitmap attribute. Any client trying to reference the new feature set will know about the new bitmap, because it knows about the new feature set(s). Legacy products will not know about the new feature set nor the new bitmap.
>
> For a cluster whose definition which does not define a FeatureMap, the server SHALL set this attribute to 0 (zero).
>
> Please see [Feature Conformance](#feature-conformance) for details on conformance.

### AttributeList Attribute

> Each instance of a cluster SHALL support this attribute. This attribute SHALL be a list of the attribute IDs of the attributes supported by the cluster instance.

### AcceptedCommandList Attribute

> This attribute is a list of client generated commands which are supported by this cluster server instance.
>
> Each instance of a cluster SHALL support this attribute.
>
> This attribute SHALL be a list of the command IDs for client generated commands that are sup­ ported and processed by the server.
>
> For each client request command in this list that mandates a response from the server, the
>
> response command SHALL be indicated in the GeneratedCommandList attribute.
>
> If any attribute on a server supports atomic writes, this attribute SHALL contain the command ID for AtomicRequest.

### GeneratedCommandList Attribute

> This attribute is a list of server generated commands. A server generated command is a server to client command.
>
> Each instance of a cluster SHALL support this attribute.
>
> This attribute SHALL be a list of the command IDs for server generated commands.
>
> For each command in this list that is a response to a client command request, the request command SHALL be indicated in the AcceptedCommandList attribute.
>
> If any attribute on a server supports atomic writes, this attribute SHALL contain the command ID for AtomicResponse.

### FabricIndex Field

> This field SHALL be present for [fabric-scoped data](#fabric-scoped-data). This field does not have to be defined explicitly in the field table for fabric-scoped data.
>
> This field SHALL NOT be present in a write interaction. For a write interaction, the server SHALL provide the value of the [accessing fabric-index](#_bookmark691) as the FabricIndex field value to processing logic, after receipt of the interaction. For a [read](#read-access) interaction this field SHALL be included in all reported data that is defined as fabric-scoped.

### AtomicRequest Command

> This command begins, commits or rolls back atomic writes. See [AtomicRequest](#atomicrequest-command-1).
>
> This command SHALL be supported by any cluster instance which has attributes with the [Atomic](#atomic-quality) [Quality](#atomic-quality).

### AtomicResponse Command

> This command is returned in response to an AtomicRequest command. See [AtomicResponse](#atomicresponse-command-1).
>
> This command SHALL be supported by any cluster instance which has attributes with the [Atomic](#atomic-quality) [Quality](#atomic-quality).

## Event

> An event defines a record of something that occurred in the past. In this regard, an event record can be thought of as a log entry, with an event record stream providing a chronological view of the events on the node.
>
> Unlike attributes, which do not provide any edge-preserving capabilities (i.e. no guarantees that every attribute change will be conveyed to observers), events permit capturing every single edge or change and conveying it reliably to an observer. This is critical for safety and security applications that rely upon such guarantees for correct behavior.
>
> Each cluster event is listed in a table that defines: [ID](#event-id-type), [Priority](#priority-field), [Access](#access), [Quality](#other-qualities), [Conformance](#conformance). Absence of a [Quality](#other-qualities) column implies that the event does not support any qualities.
>
> Event records are [readable](#read-access), and do not require the read access quality to be explicitly defined.
>
> Each generated event record SHALL have an event priority that MAY override the defined priority for that event.
>
> Each event SHALL be described in a section that defines the purpose of the event and the data fields of the event (if any).

### Event Record

> An event record is created by the node at the time the event happens. That record SHALL have the following data fields associated with it that are common to all events:

| **Name**        | **Type**   | **Conformance** |
|-----------------|------------|-----------------|
| Number          | event-no   | M               |
| SystemTimeStamp | systime-ms | O.a             |
| EpochTimeStamp  | posix-ms   | O.a             |
| Priority        | priority   | M               |
| Data            | struct     | O               |

#### Number Field

> This is an [event number](#event-number-type) value that is scoped to the node. This number SHALL be monotonically increasing for the life of the node. This monotonicity guarantee SHALL be preserved across [restarts](#_bookmark737).
>
> Between restarts, each event record SHALL be assigned a number that is exactly 1 greater than the last created event record on that Node.
>
> When a node restarts, the event number MAY increase by a larger step than 1. *Rationale*: Nodes do not need to write every new value of the event number counter to permanent storage each time it is increased (e.g. to prevent flash wear due to many write operations). One example strategy to achieve reduction of non-volatile storage updates is described below:

1.  Read the counter value at start-up.

2.  Before processing any message, write counter + N to storage, where N is a carefully chosen number (e.g. 1000). This number N should be chosen carefully in order not to exhaust the life­ time 64-bit counter space.

3.  Process messages normally until the counter has a value one less than the counter in storage. When this happens, store counter + N to storage.

#### SystemTimeStamp and EpochTimeStamp Fields

> Each event record SHALL have a timestamp at the time it was created (and not when it is reported to a client). This timestamp SHALL either be [System Time in milliseconds](#system-time-in-milliseconds-type) or [POSIX Time in millisec­](#posix-time-in-milliseconds-type) [onds](#posix-time-in-milliseconds-type).

#### Priority Field

> Each event record has an associated [priority](#priority-type). This priority describes the usage semantics of the event.

#### Data Field

> Event data fields SHALL be defined in the form of a [struct](#struct-type) in a table with the following columns for each field: ID, Name, Type, Constraint, Quality, Default, Conformance.

### Buffering

> Event records SHALL be buffered on the Node, with priority given to events of a higher priority level over a lower priority level. Within a priority level, newer event records SHALL overwrite older event records. The Node SHOULD only overwrite older events if there are newer events cre­ ated and there is insufficient space to retain both.

### Event Filtering

> Interactions that report event records MAY be filtered by [event ID](#event-id-type) and/or [event number](#event-number-type).

### Fabric-Sensitive Event

> An entire event MAY be defined as having the [fabric-sensitive quality](#fabric-sensitive-quality); otherwise, it SHALL NOT be associated with a fabric.
>
> A [read](#read-access) interaction SHALL NOT filter event records, based on fabric, for event records that are not associated with a fabric.
>
> A [read](#read-access) interaction SHALL NOT report fabric-sensitive event records that are associated with a fab­ ric different than the [accessing fabric](#accessing-fabric).
>
> A [fabric-sensitive](#fabric-sensitive-quality) event SHALL include the global [FabricIndex field](#fabricindex-field). For a [fabric-sensitive](#fabric-sensitive-quality) event it is not required to define the [FabricIndex field](#fabricindex-field) in the event field table.

## Atomic Writes

> Atomic writes allow a client to make multiple writes to certain sets of attributes atomically, such that changes are either applied entirely or none at all.

### Atomic Write Flow

| **Stage** | **Action** |  | **Action Flow** | **Description** |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| 1 | **Invoke AtomicRequest** |  | Client ⇒ Server | Begins atomic write |
|  | **Return AtomicResponse** |  | Client ⇐ Server | Acknowledges beginning of atomic write or returns error |
| 2 | Repeate d | **Read/Write Request** | Client ⇒ Server | Reads or writes to attrib­ utes |
|  |  | **Read/Write Response** | Client ⇐ Server | Acknowledges write or errors |
| 3 | **Invoke AtomicRequest** |  | Client ⇒ Server | Commits or cancels atomic write |
|  | **Return AtomicResponse** |  | Client ⇐ Server | Acknowledges commit of atomic write or returns error |

> Atomic writes have three stages:

1.  The client requests to begin an atomic write by providing a list of attributes with the Atomic Write quality and a timeout for completing its expected writes

    1.  The server responds with a list of [attribute statuses](#atomicattributestatusstruct-type), and possibly an alternative timeout

    2.  If the client does not accept the statuses or the alternative timeout, then the client SHALL cancel the atomic write using a [Rollback Write](#_bookmark766) request.

2.  Otherwise, the client makes a series of write requests to the attributes

    1.  The server pends these writes in an internal buffer, potentially returning errors if a write can not possibly succeed during a commit

3.  If the client no longer wants to continue, then it requests to roll back the atomic write; other­ wise, the client requests to commit the atomic write

    1.  The server evaluates all the writes, and either applies all of them or returns an error to the client, discarding the pending writes

### Atomic Writer ID

> An Atomic Writer ID is an [Operational Node ID](#operational-node-id) which identifies the client within the [accessing fab­](#accessing-fabric) [ric](#accessing-fabric).
>
> If the session context for the transaction is a [Secure Session Context](#secure-session-context), the Atomic Writer ID SHALL be the Peer Node ID stored in the context.
>
> If the session context for the transaction is a [Groupcast Session Context](#groupcast-session-context), the Atomic Writer ID SHALL be invalid.
>
> An Atomic Writer ID that is not a valid [Operational Node ID](#operational-node-id) SHALL be invalid.

### Atomic Write State

> An Atomic Write State associates a client with a set of atomic attributes on a server. It is the combi­ nation of:

4.  An endpoint-no

5.  A cluster-id

6.  An [Atomic Writer ID](#atomic-writer-id)

7.  The [accessing fabric](#accessing-fabric)

8.  A set of attrib-ids

> An attribute on a given server cluster instance is associated with an Atomic Write State if the state’s set of attrib-ids contains the ID of the attribute, the cluster-id matches the ID of the cluster instance and its endpoint-no matches the endpoint of cluster instance.
>
> A client is associated with an Atomic Write State if both its [Atomic Writer ID](#atomic-writer-id) and [accessing fabric](#accessing-fabric) match the [Atomic Writer ID](#atomic-writer-id) and [accessing fabric](#accessing-fabric) of the client.
>
> If a server receives a Write Request for an attribute that is not associated with an Atomic Write State that is also associated with the client making the request, the server SHALL return the error code INVALID_IN_STATE.
>
> Reading an attribute with the Atomic quality from a client with an associated Atomic Write State SHALL return the current value of the attribute if the client has not successfully written to the attribute; if the client has written to the attribute while having an associated Atomic Write State, the server SHALL return the updated value of the attribute.
>
> When writing to any attribute associated with an Atomic Write State, any integrity checks SHALL be evaluated in the context of the pending values of all the attributes associated with the Atomic Write State.
>
> Any writes to attributes with the Atomic quality from a client associated with an Atomic Write State SHALL only be visible to that client until committed, and SHALL NOT have any effect on the opera­ tion of the server.
>
> If a server receives a command which modifies an attribute with the Atomic quality while a client has an Atomic Write State containing the attrib-id of that attribute, it SHALL apply these changes as if there were no atomic write; this MAY cause the atomic write to fail when the client attempts to commit (see [Commit Write](#_bookmark765)).

### AtomicRequestTypeEnum Type

> This data type is derived from enum8.

| **Value** | **Name**       | **Summary**           | **Conformance** |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------------|-----------------|
| 0         | **BeginWrite** | Begin an atomic write | M               |

| **Value** | **Name** | **Summary** | **Conformance** |
|----|----|----|----|
| 1 | **CommitWrite** | Commit an atomic write | M |
| 2 | **RollbackWrite** | Rollback an atomic write, discarding any pending changes | M |

### AtomicAttributeStatusStruct Type

> This struct indicates the status of an attribute during an atomic write.

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Access** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **Attribut­ eID** | attrib-id |  |  |  |  | M |
| 1 | **Status­ Code** | status |  |  |  |  | M |

#### AttributeID Field

> This field SHALL indicate the ID of the attribute with the associated [StatusCode](#statuscode-field).

#### StatusCode Field

> This field SHALL indicate the atomic status of an attribute.

### AtomicRequest Command

> This command is used to begin, commit or cancel an atomic write.

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **Request­ Type** | [AtomicRe­](#atomicrequesttypeenum-type) [questType­](#atomicrequesttypeenum-type) [Enum](#atomicrequesttypeenum-type) |  |  |  | M |
| 1 | **Attribut­ eRequests** | list\[attrib-id\] |  |  |  | M |
| 2 | **Timeout** | uint16 |  |  |  | desc |

#### RequestType Field

> This field SHALL indicate the type of atomic request being made by the client.

#### AttributeRequests Field

> This field SHALL indicate a list of attribute IDs the client wishes to write to during an atomic
>
> request.

#### Timeout Field

> This field SHALL indicate an interval in milliseconds in which the client will either commit or roll­ back the atomic write. If the value of the RequestType field is BeginWrite, this field SHALL be included, otherwise it SHALL be omitted.

#### Effect on Receipt

> If an AtomicRequest command is received without an accessing fabric, the server SHALL return a status code of INVALID_COMMAND.
>
> If an AtomicRequest command is received with an [Atomic Writer ID](#atomic-writer-id) which is either unavailable or not a valid [Operational Node ID](#operational-node-id), the server SHALL return a status code of INVALID_COMMAND.
>
> For AtomicRequests with any RequestType:

1.  If the [AttributeRequests](#attributerequests-field) field is empty, the server SHALL return an error code of INVALID_COM­ MAND.

2.  If the [AttributeRequests](#attributerequests-field) field contains duplicate values, the server SHALL return an error code of INVALID_COMMAND.

3.  If the [AttributeRequests](#attributerequests-field) contains attrib-ids for attributes not supported by the server, the server SHALL return an error code of INVALID_COMMAND.

> **Begin Write**
>
> If the RequestType of the AtomicRequest is BeginWrite, the server SHALL attempt to begin an atomic write and return an AtomicResponse:

1.  If the client is already associated with an [Atomic Write State](#atomic-write-state) that is associated with any attrib­ utes on the same cluster and endpoint, the server SHALL return a status code of INVALID_IN_S­ TATE.

2.  If the request does not have a [Timeout Field](#timeout-field), the server SHALL return an error code of INVALID_COMMAND.

3.  Otherwise, the server SHALL return an [AtomicResponse](#atomicresponse-command-1):

    1.  For each attrib-id in [AttributeRequests](#attributerequests-field), the server SHALL return a matching [AtomicAttribut­](#atomicattributestatusstruct-type) [eStatusStruct](#atomicattributestatusstruct-type) in [AttributeStatus](#attributestatus-field):

        1.  If the client does not have sufficient privilege to write to the attribute, the [status](#statuscode-field) SHALL be UNSUPPORTED_ACCESS.

        2.  If the specified attribute does not support atomic writes, the [status](#statuscode-field) SHALL be INVALID\_­ COMMAND.

        3.  If the specified attribute is currently being used by a different atomic write, the [status](#statuscode-field) SHALL be BUSY.

        4.  If the server does not have enough resources to pend writes to the attribute, the [status](#statuscode-field) SHALL be RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED.

        5.  Otherwise, the [status](#statuscode-field) SHALL be SUCCESS to indicate that the attribute is available for writing.

    2.  For internal reasons, a server MAY implement atomic writes for a set of attributes with a shared resource, such that beginning an atomic write to any of the attributes in the set requires including all of the attributes in the set. If attributes other than the requested attributes are included in an atomic write, the server SHALL return statuses for those attrib­ utes as if they had been requested.

    3.  Subsequent invocations of [AtomicRequest](#atomicrequest-command-1) of type [Commit Write](#_bookmark765) or [Rollback Write](#_bookmark766) MUST provide the attrib-ids returned in [AttributeStatus](#attributestatus-field), not the attrib-ids requested in [Attribut­](#attributerequests-field) [eRequests](#attributerequests-field).

    4.  If any of the requested attributes have a [status code](#statuscode-field) other than SUCCESS, the [StatusCode](#statuscode-field-1) of the AtomicResponse SHALL be FAILURE.

        1.  The server SHALL NOT associate an [Atomic Write State](#atomic-write-state) with the client.

        2.  Depending on the [status codes](#statuscode-field) received for individual attributes, the client MAY choose to try again; e.g. if the attribute the client was attempting to write to has status BUSY, the client could attempt to write to it again after a pause.

    5.  Otherwise, the [StatusCode](#statuscode-field-1) SHALL be SUCCESS.

        1.  The server SHALL create an [Atomic Write State](#atomic-write-state) with the endpoint number and ID of the cluster instance handling the AtomicRequest command, the [accessing fabric](#accessing-fabric), the [Atomic](#atomic-writer-id) [Writer ID](#atomic-writer-id), and the set of attrib-ids returned.

        2.  If the requested timeout is longer than the maximum timeout the server allows for the requested set of attributes, the server MAY return the maximum timeout for the requested set of attributes in the [Timeout](#timeout-field-1) field. Otherwise, the server SHALL return the requested timeout in the [Timeout](#timeout-field-1) field.

        3.  If the server does not receive a matching AtomicRequest with a RequestType of Com­ mitWrite from the associated client before the timeout provided by the server in the AtomicResponse, the server SHALL roll back any pending writes and discard the atomic write.

> **Commit Write**
>
> If the RequestType of the AtomicRequest is CommitWrite, the server SHALL attempt to commit any pending writes and return an AtomicResponse:

1.  If the client is not associated with an [Atomic Write State](#atomic-write-state) whose endpoint-no and cluster-id match the endpoint number and ID of the cluster instance handling the request, and whose set of attrib-ids match the attrib-ids requested, irrespective of order, the server SHALL return an error code of INVALID_IN_STATE.

2.  The server SHALL process all pending writes to the requested atomic attributes as if they had arrived in a single message.

3.  The server SHALL create a list of [attribute statuses](#atomicattributestatusstruct-type) for each attribute that would be modified by the processing of the atomic write:

    1.  If the server is able to determine that the atomic write will not succeed, the [status code](#statuscode-field) SHALL indicate the error code that would have been received on the first failed write to that

> attribute.

1.  For example, if a write is an attempt to replace a list, but the data version has changed since the atomic write began due to a command invocation, the [status code](#statuscode-field) would be DATA_VERSION_MISMATCH.

&nbsp;

2.  Otherwise, the [status code](#statuscode-field) SHALL be SUCCESS.

&nbsp;

4.  If the [status code](#statuscode-field) of any [AtomicAttributeStatusStruct](#atomicattributestatusstruct-type) in the list is not SUCCESS, then the server SHALL:

    1.  Discard all pending writes to the attributes associated with the [Atomic Write State](#atomic-write-state) associ­ ated with the client

    2.  Discard the [Atomic Write State](#atomic-write-state) associated with the client

    3.  Return an [AtomicResponse](#atomicresponse-command-1) with the list of [attribute statuses](#atomicattributestatusstruct-type) and an [atomic status code](#statuscode-field-1) of FAILURE.

5.  Otherwise, if the writes would collectively violate a constraint, then the server SHALL:

    1.  Discard all pending writes to the attributes associated with the [Atomic Write State](#atomic-write-state) associ­ ated with the client

    2.  Discard the [Atomic Write State](#atomic-write-state) associated with the client

    3.  Return an [AtomicResponse](#atomicresponse-command-1) with the list of [attribute statuses](#atomicattributestatusstruct-type) and an [atomic status code](#statuscode-field-1) of CONSTRAINT_ERROR.

6.  Otherwise, the server SHALL:

    1.  Create a list of [attribute statuses](#atomicattributestatusstruct-type) for each attribute referenced by a pending write

    2.  Attempt to apply all pending writes to the attributes in the [Atomic Write State](#atomic-write-state) associated with the client:

        1.  For each pending write, write the pending value to the attribute, and store the returned status code in the [status code](#statuscode-field) field on the [attribute status](#atomicattributestatusstruct-type) whose [AttributeID](#attributeid-field) matches the ID of the attribute.

        2.  If any pending write fails, return an [AtomicResponse](#atomicresponse-command-1) with an [atomic status code](#statuscode-field-1) of FAIL­ URE and the list of [attribute statuses](#atomicattributestatusstruct-type).

        3.  Otherwise, return an [AtomicResponse](#atomicresponse-command-1) with an [atomic status code](#statuscode-field-1) of SUCCESS and an empty list of [attribute statuses](#atomicattributestatusstruct-type).

    3.  Discard the [Atomic Write State](#atomic-write-state) associated with the client

> **Rollback Write**
>
> If the RequestType of the AtomicRequest is RollbackWrite, the server SHALL attempt to rollback any pending writes and return an AtomicResponse.

1.  If the client is not associated with an [Atomic Write State](#atomic-write-state) whose endpoint-no and cluster-id match the endpoint number and ID of the cluster instance handling the request, and whose set of attrib-ids match the attrib-ids requested, irrespective of order, the server SHALL return an error code of INVALID_IN_STATE.

2.  Otherwise, the server SHALL:

    1.  Discard all pending writes to the attributes associated with the [Atomic Write State](#atomic-write-state) associ­ ated with the client

    2.  Discard the [Atomic Write State](#atomic-write-state) associated with the client

    3.  Return an [AtomicResponse](#atomicresponse-command-1) with an [atomic status code](#statuscode-field-1) of SUCCESS.

### AtomicResponse Command

> The AtomicResponse command is sent by a server in response to an AtomicRequest command.

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **StatusCode** | status |  |  |  | M |
| 1 | **AttributeS­ tatus** | list\[[Atomi­](#atomicattributestatusstruct-type) [cAttributeS­](#atomicattributestatusstruct-type) [tatusStruct](#atomicattributestatusstruct-type)\] |  |  |  | M |
| 2 | **Timeout** | uint16 |  |  |  | desc |

#### StatusCode Field

> This field SHALL indicate the status of the atomic write. See [AtomicRequest](#atomicrequest-command-1).

#### AttributeStatus Field

> This field SHALL indicate a list of statuses for the attributes involved in the atomic write. This list SHALL contain a status for each of the attribute IDs provided in the AtomicRequest. See [AtomicRe­](#atomicrequest-command-1) [quest](#atomicrequest-command-1).

#### Timeout Field

> This field SHALL indicate an effective timeout provided by the server. If the value of the Request­ Type field in the AtomicRequest is BeginWrite, this field SHALL be included, otherwise it SHALL be omitted. See [AtomicRequest](#atomicrequest-command-1).

## Device Type

> In this architecture model, a device type is the highest semantic element. A device type defines con­ formance for a set of one or more endpoints. A device type defines a set of requirements for the node or endpoint in the market.
>
> A device type SHALL define the cluster support for an endpoint. A composed device type MAY define one or more other device types as part of the composed device type.
>
> A device type definition MAY define or use predefined conditions from requirements, limitations and/or capabilities of the node. A device type definition MAY define or use predefined conditions on one or more underlying stack standard(s).
>
> A device type MAY define support of a cluster as dependent upon a condition. A device type defini­
>
> tion MAY specify optional clusters that are recommended as enhancements. A device type definition MAY refine cluster conformance:

- Support of optional cluster elements or features MAY be changed to mandatory depending on device type conditions.

- Support of optional cluster elements or features MAY depend on device type conditions.

> A device type definition SHALL specify a device type ID, device revision, and a set of one or more mandatory clusters including each cluster’s minimum revision.
>
> A device type definition MAY be generic and allow many similar clusters, where at least one instance SHALL be required.

[TABLE]

> If all sensor devices are common in cluster requirements (except the clusters that perform the sens­ ing), then there is no reason to create a device type for each sensor cluster.
>
> A device type definition MAY be very specific and list particular clusters as mandatory.

[TABLE]

### Device Type Revision

> A device type revision is an unsigned integer that is associated with an approved revision and release of a device type definition. The initial value for a device type revision SHALL be 1. The ini­ tial revision (1) of a device type definition SHALL require the latest (at the time of definition the cluster) certifiable revisions of the clusters it mandates. Any mandatory changes to the device type definition SHALL only augment, not modify, the function of the device. Any changes SHALL incre­ ment the version of the device. Newer versions of the device SHALL interoperate with older revi­ sions at the older revision’s level of functionality.

[TABLE]

### Device Type Composition

> A device type definition MAY be a composed device type and therefore require other device types for its composition. A device type instance MAY be composed of other endpoints that support extra cluster instances. Please see the [System Model](#chapter-9.-system-model-specification) specification for more details.

### Device Type Classification

> Each device type definition SHALL specify the endpoint as being either a Utility, or Application. Each device type definition SHALL specify the scope as either endpoint or node. Each Application device type definition SHALL specify the endpoint as being either Simple or Dynamic.

#### Utility Device Type

> A Utility device type supports configuration and settings. A utility device type definition SHALL define requirements for utility clusters. A utility device type MAY also represent the physical device or product. There MAY be more than one endpoint supporting a utility device type on a node.
>
> Examples of utility device types: Root Node, Power Source, Bridged Node.

#### Application Device Type

> Application devices types are typically the most common endpoints on a node and in the network. An endpoint supporting an application device type is an application endpoint. An Application device type SHALL be scoped to the endpoint. An application endpoint SHALL support clusters the primary application function of the endpoint.
>
> Examples of application device type categories: HVAC, lighting, sensing, etc.

#### Simple Device Type

> A Simple device type supports local control that is persistent, independent, and unsupervised. A Simple device type is an Application device type. Simple devices types are typically the most com­ mon endpoints in the network. Simple device type examples: sensors, actuators, lights, on/off switches, on/off power outlets, etc. Simple endpoints support independent operation without cen­ tral control or gateways. An endpoint supporting a simple device type is a simple endpoint. Simple endpoints SHALL support relationships through bindings.

#### Dynamic Device Type

> A Dynamic device type supports intelligent and supervisory services, such as commissioning, moni­ toring, trend analysis, scheduling and central management. A dynamic device type is an application device type. An endpoint supporting a dynamic device type is a dynamic endpoint. A dynamic end­ point is typically found on a central controller where there exists an intelligent supervisory applica­ tion that manages simple device control applications. Typically, a dynamic endpoint supports client clusters for central control, management, monitoring or supervisory functions. Typically, the prod­ uct supporting a dynamic endpoint has visibility into the entire network (or part thereof) of simple endpoints.
>
> A dynamic endpoint client cluster instance MAY be used to multiplex transactions to or from multi­ ple simple device server clusters in the network. A dynamic endpoint client cluster MAY initiate interactions to many server clusters in the network. A dynamic endpoint client cluster MAY receive data from many server clusters in the network. Dynamic endpoints MAY support relationships through bindings. A dynamic device endpoint MAY support one or more external agents, outside the node stack, that manage relationships. External agents include, but are not limited to, a cloud application, a smartphone, an in-home display, or a configuration tool.

#### Device Type Scope

> A node device type is a utility device type scoped to a node. A node device type definition SHALL support clusters that represent the entire node. An endpoint supporting a node device type is a node endpoint. A node endpoint MAY also represent the physical device or product. There MAY be more than one node endpoint on a node.
>
> Other classes of device types are endpoint scoped device types.

### Extra Clusters on an Endpoint

> An endpoint MAY support extra clusters not mandated by the device type definition. An endpoint MAY support optional features or cluster items (attributes, commands, events, etc.), that are not mandated by the device type definition. Extra clusters, features, or cluster items, SHALL only aug­ ment, not modify, the function of the device type or clusters.
>
> A device type definition MAY list clusters as optional, which implies they can augment the device type. Clients MAY use those clusters to augment the operation of the other clusters for the device type.
>
> In case of clusters appearing on an endpoint which are not listed in the Cluster Requirements table of a device type definition, there may not be a well-defined standard interpretation with respect to the context of that device type, so clients MAY ambiguously interpret how, or when, the extra clus­ ters are intended to be used. Clients MAY ignore any clusters which are not listed in the Cluster Requirements table of a device type definition when interacting with the endpoint. This is true even for clusters that would otherwise appear to a client’s or server’s implementer as "obvious".

### Primary Device Type

> The Primary Device Type is selected according to the following rules:

- When a device combines multiple application device types, the manufacturer SHALL choose the application device type identifier of the primary function of the device as the Primary Device Type.

- When a device has a single application device type, the manufacturer SHALL use that as the Pri­ mary Device Type.

- For devices exposing multiple application device types for which the [superset device type](#superset-device-types) condi­ tion holds, the superset device type of the set of device types SHALL be used as Primary Device Type.

> The Primary Device Type is used in the DCL ([field DeviceTypeID](#devicetypeid)), in the [Certification Declaration](#certification-declaration-cd-format) (field device_type_id) and in announcements ([TXT key for device type](#txt-key-for-device-type-dt)). Since the DCL field [Device­](#devicetypeid) [TypeID](#devicetypeid) is not mutable, the Primary Device Type cannot change over the lifecycle of a product (e.g. via a software update).
>
> Example: A desk lamp contains a light (Extended Color Light) and a switch (Generic Switch) to con­ trol the light. The Extended Color Light matches the primary function of the device, so this is selected as Primary Device Type.
>
> Example: A dimmable light bulb exposes Dimmable Light and On/Off Light device types. Since Dim­ mable Light is the superset device type, this is selected as Primary Device Type.

## Non-Standard

> This architecture model provides mechanisms for non-standard or manufacturer specific items such as clusters, commands, events, attributes and attribute data fields. These items MAY be sup­ ported on a certified product. Such vendor specific items SHALL NOT change the standard behavior of the standard items. The specific function of a vendor specific item cannot be tested as part of cer­ tification. They can only be tested to verify that they do no harm, and conform to proper behavior with regard to identification, discovery, error processing, etc. A non-standard item SHOULD NOT take the place of a standard item that provides the same function. It is up to the certification authority to make a judgment call that is in keeping with the spirit of these requirements. Imple­ menters are encouraged to develop and certify standard items, not non-standard items.

## Data Field

> A data field is any attribute, field or entry that is not a collection data type, or data that is not sur­ faced as an attribute, but defined in a cluster specification.
>
> Optional attribute data MAY be referenced as data fields in other attribute specifications within the same cluster specification. Cluster specifications also define data fields that are not surfaced, such as temporary calculated values, or persistent state values. Any defined data value in a cluster speci­ fication is a data field.
>
> Each cluster data field SHALL be defined with a table including these columns for data qualities:

- [Data Type](#data-types)

- [Constraint](#constraint)

- [Quality](#other-qualities)

- [Access](#access)

- [Default](#default-column)

- [Conformance](#conformance)

> A data field SHALL inherit (if possible) the qualities from the [cluster first-order element](#element) of which it is part, unless overridden. It SHOULD be rare to override inherited qualities.

[TABLE]

> New or optional data fields might not be recognized by a receiver, such as a legacy receiver. The data field description SHALL define default behavior (such as absence of behavior) when a new or optional data field is not present. It is recommended to define or use a feature when adding new or optional data fields, to better indicate conformance. It is recommended to define a [default value](#default-column), such as a null value, that indicates such default behavior.

### Nullable

> When a data field value is required to designate an unknown, invalid, or undefined data value, and there is no obvious data value (e.g. zero), that is within the valid range to indicate this, the data field MAY be designated as nullable, so that an implemented instance of data MAY have the value of null.
>
> In this context, these wordings have the same meaning:

- The data field has the value of null.

- The data field has the null value.

- The data field is the null value.

- The data field is null.

> Representation of null for the implementation of the Data Model is a consideration of the underly­ ing encoding specification. The encoding layer SHALL have the capability to indicate null for any nullable data field. How the encoding layer indicates null is outside the scope of the Data Model specification.
>
> All data fields MAY be defined to be nullable, regardless of data type.
>
> A cluster specification SHALL define whether a data field is nullable. A cluster specification SHALL define the meaning of the null value.
>
> Composite data types that have a length (i.e. octet string and list), and derived types that have those as the base type, SHALL NOT differentiate semantically between the null value and the empty (zero length) value. In particular a zero-length value SHALL be allowed for nullable values of these types no matter what other length constraints are imposed on the value, and SHALL have the same semantics as the null value.
>
> A fabric-scoped list SHALL NOT be nullable.

### Optional or Deprecated

> An optional or deprecated data field that is not implemented, and therefore does not exist, SHALL NOT be indicated as the null value. How the encoding layer encodes non-existent data is outside the scope of the Data Model specification.
>
> The Conformance column SHALL define if a data field is optional or deprecated. To manage the data identifier namespace, a deprecated data field SHALL NOT be removed from text that lists its identifier and default value. The description text of a deprecated data field SHALL be removed for new revisions of specification text.
>
> If the specification text of a cluster depends on the value of an optional or deprecated data field of the same cluster, then the data field SHALL have a well-defined default value that SHALL be used when the data field is not implemented.

### Constraint & Value

> The tables below describe the nomenclature for describing constraints and default data values. This
>
> nomenclature is used in the cluster specifications for data value constraints, defaults, and other definitions.

#### Common Literal Values

> These values are commonly used in cluster text and Default columns in cluster data definition tables.

| **Value** | **Description** |
|----|----|
| **0** | The numeral zero is used to indicate the zero value for analog data. This is equivalent to the boolean value FALSE. |
| **1** | This is used for any analog data type to mean that the value is 1. This is equivalent to the boolean value TRUE. |
| **FALSE** | "FALSE", "false" or "False" is a boolean value and is equivalent to 0 (zero). |
| **TRUE** | "TRUE", "true" or "True" is a boolean value and is equivalent to 1. |
| **NaN** | Not a Number defined for any floating point val­ ues. |
| **null** | This indicates the value of null. |
| **empty** | This indicates empty list or string data. |
| **min** | The minimum possible data value for the data type. |
| **max** | The maximum possible data value for the data type. |
| *numeric units* | Some number in some well-defined units as described in the data type (e.g. 100^(o) C) |

#### Constraint

> The Constraint column is valid for any composed device type, attribute or data field of an attribute, event, command or struct. It is RECOMMENDED to always define a constraint for any data field.

| **Constraint** | **Description** |
|----|----|
| desc | Defines the constraint is defined in the descrip­ tion section |
| **Composed Device Type Constraints** |  |
| *x*\* | Defines the exact number of endpoints, greater than zero, supporting this device type as a part of the composed device type |

[TABLE]

| **Constraint** | **Description** |
|----|----|
| all | Defines no constraint on the number of entries in the list. Same as "min to max". |
| *constraint*, *constraint*… | Defines support of a [union](#list-and-string-constraint) of two or more list range or limit constraints |
| *list_constraint*\[ *entry_constraint* \] | Defines *list_constraint* as a [list constraint](#_bookmark790) and *entry_constraint* as a constraint on the entry data type. See also [list entry qualities](#_bookmark800) |
| **Character String Data Type Constraints** |  |
| *char_constraint*{ *z* } | Defines *char_constraint* as the [string constraint](#_bookmark789) [in bytes](#_bookmark789) and *z* as the maximum number of Uni­ code codepoints. |

- *x*, *y*, or *z* are literal values of the data type or from the [Common Literal Values](#common-literal-values).

#### List and String Constraint

> The minimum number of entries for list or size of a string SHALL be 0 (zero), unless redefined using the above notation.
>
> A comma delimited set of constraints for a list or string defines a union constraint. A union con­ straint SHALL only have one minimum (min *x*) constraint and one maximum (max *y*) constraint. A union constraint SHALL NOT define a range below the minimum constraint or range greater than the maximum constraint, including the defined [minimum](#_bookmark787) (min) and [maximum](#_bookmark787) (max) for the data type.
>
> A constraint on a list or string data means that the data SHALL always be indicated within that con­ straint. A constraint on a [writeable](#write-access) list or string data means that the data SHALL support writing within the constraint, and SHALL NOT support writing outside the constraint.

#### Effective Maximum for Character String Data Type

> A server SHALL support up to the maximum in [*char_constraint*](#_bookmark791) for a character string data type. The character string data SHALL NOT contain more than *z* Unicode codepoints.

[TABLE]

#### Nullable in Range

> If data is [nullable](#nullable) then null SHALL be a valid value.
>
> If the data type is a list or derived from a list, and the list is nullable, then a length of 0 (zero) SHALL be supported, and defined in the constraint column.
>
> If the data type is an octet string, or derived from an octet string (e.g. character string), and the data
>
> is nullable, then a length of 0 (zero) SHALL be supported, and defined in the constraint column.

### Default Column

> A default value defined in the Default column is not meant to be the value used when the server returns to factory fresh settings. Specified conformance for data fields may be optional or change over time. A default value is defined to complete dependencies when the actual data field value is not present.
>
> A data field SHALL have a defined default value when:

- the data field is new, and a default is required for backwards compatibility with legacy instances

- the data field is optional, deprecated, or obsolete and therefore is not always present

- an initial value is needed before the application starts

- the value cannot be determined by the application for the instance

- there is a dependency on the attribute value to formulate other data or affect behavior

> If a default value is not defined for a data field, the default value is determined by the following conditions:

- If the data field is nullable then the default value SHALL be null

- Else the default value SHALL be one of the following, depending on type:

  - Boolean: false

  - Analog: 0 or 0.0, depending on range

  - Bitmaps: 0

  - Enumeration: MS

  - Composite:

    - String: empty

    - List: empty

    - Struct: default is recursively composited from the defaults of its member fields

  - Derived types: use the default value of the base type

> These are the options for the Default column used for attributes or attribute, command or event data:

| **Default Column** | **Description** |
|----|----|
| *x* | a literal value *x* of the data type, or as defined in [Common Literal Values](#common-literal-values) |
| MS | a manufacturer or implementation specific value |

> If the default value of a data field is specified as manufacturer specific, then there SHALL be no
>
> defined default value and the application SHALL support a manufacturer specific value that is in the valid range.

## Data Types

> Each data field in a cluster specification SHALL have a well-defined data type. Each attribute in a cluster specification SHALL map to a single data type.
>
> The table indicates for each data type whether it defines an analog or discrete value. Values of ana­ log types MAY be added to or subtracted from other values of the same type and are typically used to measure the value of physical properties that can vary continuously over a range. Values of dis­ crete data types only have meaning as individual values and SHALL NOT be added or subtracted.
>
> Some data types specify bit-widths for future potential growth in range (analog) or number of val­ ues (discrete).
>
> Cluster specifications SHALL use the unique data type short name to reduce the text size of the specification.

#### Single-Precision Type

> The single precision number format is based on the [IEEE 754-2019](#_bookmark28) single precision (32-bit) format for binary floating-point arithmetic.
>
> See [IEEE 754-2019](#_bookmark28) for more details on the representable values.

#### Double Precision Type

> The double precision number format is based on the [IEEE 754-2019](#_bookmark28) double precision (64-bit) format for binary floating-point arithmetic.
>
> The format and interpretation of values of this data type follow the same rules as given for the sin­ gle precision data type, but with wider mantissa and exponent ranges.
>
> See [IEEE 754-2019](#_bookmark28) for more details on the representable values.

#### Octet String Type

> The octet string data type defines a sequence of octets with a finite octet count from 0 to 65534. It is RECOMMENDED to define a [constraint](#constraint) on the maximum possible count.

#### List

> A list is defined as a collection of entries of the same data type, with a finite count from 0 to 65534. A cluster specification may define further constraints on the maximum possible count. The list entry data type SHALL be any defined data type, except a [list](#list) data type, or any data type derived from a list.
>
> The quality columns for a list definition are for the list.
>
> The list entries are indicated with an index that is an unsigned integer starting at 0 (zero). The maintained order of entries, by index, is defined in the cluster specification, or undefined. Data that is defined as a list is indicated with "list\[*X*\]" where *X* is the entry type. The data type of the list entry has its own qualities, constraints, and conformance.
>
> To define qualities for the list entry data type, make the list entry data type a defined local derived data type, with a table including the columns required to define and constrain the data type.

[TABLE]

> There is an inline shortcut to define the list entry data type constraints. See [List Constraints](#_bookmark790).

[TABLE]

> It is RECOMMENDED to put a maximum [constraint](#constraint) on the list and list entry data types.
>
> It is RECOMMENDED that a list entry data type be a struct, to enable the addition of new fields to the list’s entries in the future.

- The cluster data version SHALL be incremented when the list order or entries change.

- An entry SHALL NOT be null.

- The list SHALL support reading and reporting all entries.

- The list SHALL support reporting, updates, and/or deletion of one or more entries.

- If the list is writable, it SHALL support writing or deleting the entire list.

- If the list is writable, it SHALL support updating one or more individual entries by indicating an index per updated entry.

- If the list is writable, it SHALL support deleting one or more individual entries by indicating an index per deleted entry.

- If the list is writable, it SHALL support adding one or more individual entries.

- A list MAY define an entry that is a struct that is fabric-scoped (see [Fabric-Scoped Quality](#fabric-scoped-quality)).

> **Fabric-Scoped List**

- A fabric-scoped list SHALL define an entry data type that is a struct, which SHALL also be fab­ ric-scoped (see [Fabric-Scoped Struct](#_bookmark804)).

> Each entry in a fabric-scoped list SHALL be fabric-scoped to a particular fabric or no fabric.
>
> **Fabric-Filtered List**
>
> A fabric-scoped list supports a fabric-filter that filters the view of the list for [read](#read-access) and [write](#write-access) interac­ tions. This filter simplifies client side logic that does not want to read or write fabric data that is not associated with the [accessing fabric](#accessing-fabric).

- An interaction upon a list with fabric-filtering SHALL only indicate and access entries where the [associated fabric](#_bookmark693) matches the [accessing fabric](#accessing-fabric), and all other entries SHALL be ignored.

- Fabric-filtered list entries SHALL be in the same order as the full list.

- Fabric-filtered list entries SHALL be indexed from 0 with no gaps, as if the other entries did not exist.

- For a [write](#write-access) interaction, fabric-filtering SHALL be enabled.

- When writing to a fabric-scoped list, the write interaction SHALL be on an [accessing fabric](#accessing-fabric), oth­ erwise, the write interaction SHALL fail (see [Interaction Model](#chapter-8.-interaction-model-specification)).

- For a [read](#read-access) interaction on a list, fabric-filtering MAY be enabled.

- For a [read](#read-access) interaction on a list, with fabric-filtering disabled, the list SHALL be reported as a full list with all entries.

[TABLE]

[TABLE]

#### Struct Type

> A struct is a sequence of fields of any data type. Individual fields are identified by a field ID of unsigned integer, starting at 0 (zero), for the first field.

- A struct itself SHALL have no constraint qualities.

- Each struct field SHALL have its own qualities.

- Access, conformance and persistence qualities, when not explicitly defined, SHALL be inherited from the instance of the struct itself.

- Struct fields MAY have optional conformance.

- A struct SHALL support reading and reporting of all fields.

- A struct SHALL support reporting changes to one or more fields.

- If the struct is writable, it SHALL support writing the entire struct.

- If a field of the struct is writable, the struct SHALL support updating the field.

- Because of optional struct field conformance, instances of the same struct MAY support multiple 'flavors' of the same struct data type, but with a different set of optional fields.

> **Fabric-Scoped Struct**

- A fabric-scoped struct SHALL only be defined and occur as an entry in a fabric-scoped list.

- A fabric-scoped struct SHALL support the [global FabricIndex field](#fabricindex-field) of type [fabric-index](#fabric-index-type), which indicates the [associated fabric](#_bookmark693) of the struct, or indicates that there is no associated fabric.

- The table that defines fields of a fabric-scoped struct SHALL NOT list the [global FabricIndex](#fabricindex-field) [field](#fabricindex-field), which is a global field and defined implicitly.

- The [global FabricIndex field](#fabricindex-field) of a fabric-scoped struct SHOULD NOT be indicated in a write inter­ action.

- The [global FabricIndex field](#fabricindex-field) of a fabric-scoped struct SHALL be ignored in a write interaction.

- The [global FabricIndex field](#fabricindex-field) SHOULD NOT be indicated on a fabric-scoped struct contained in the payload of a command request.

&nbsp;

- The [global FabricIndex field](#fabricindex-field) SHALL be ignored on a fabric-scoped struct contained in the pay­ load of a command request.

- When a [write](#write-access) interaction creates a fabric-scoped struct entry (in a fabric-scoped list), the server SHALL implicitly load the [accessing fabric-index](#_bookmark691) into the [global FabricIndex field](#fabricindex-field) of the struct.

- When the payload of a command request contains a fabric-scoped struct, the server SHALL implicitly load the [accessing fabric-index](#_bookmark691) into the [global FabricIndex field](#fabricindex-field) of the struct.

- A fabric-scoped struct MAY be defined with some fields that are [fabric-sensitive](#fabric-sensitive-quality).

- For interactions on a fabric-scoped struct that report back data, fabric-sensitive struct fields SHALL NOT be indicated when reporting data back to the client, when the struct has an [associ­](#_bookmark693) [ated fabric](#_bookmark693), and it is not the [accessing fabric](#accessing-fabric).

### Derived Data Types

> These data types are commonly used and derived from the base data types. If a data type is used by more than one cluster specification, then it SHALL be listed here as a derived data type. Such com­ mon data types can then be reused instead of redefined in each cluster specification.

>
> **Month Field**
>
> This field represents months January (1) to December (12).

>
> **DayOfWeek Field**
>
> This represents the day of the week from Monday (1) to Sunday (7).

#### Epoch Time in Microseconds Type

> This type represents an offset, in microseconds, from 0 hours, 0 minutes, 0 seconds, on the 1st of January, 2000 UTC (the Epoch), encoded as an unsigned 64-bit scalar value.
>
> This offset is the sum of two parts: time elapsed, not counting leap-seconds, and a local time offset. The local time offset MAY include a timezone offset and a MAY include a DST offset.
>
> Any use of this type SHALL indicate how the associated local time offset is determined in the spe­ cific context of that use. This MAY be done, for example, by simply saying the time is a UTC time, in which case the local time offset is 0.
>
> A given Epoch Time value MAY be interpreted in at least two ways:

1.  The value can be converted to a local clock date/time (year, month, day, hours, minutes, sec­ onds, microseconds) by treating the local time offset as 0 and finding the UTC (year, month, day, hours, minutes, seconds, microseconds) tuple that corresponds to an elapsed time since the epoch time equal to the given value. The value then represents that tuple, but interpreted in the specific timezone and DST situation associated with the value. This procedure does not require knowing the local time offset of the value.

2.  The value can be converted to a UTC time by subtracting the associated local time offset from the Epoch Time value and then treating the resulting value as an elapsed count of microseconds since the epoch time.

> For example, an Epoch Time value of 0x0000_0BF1_B7E1_0000 corresponds to an offset of exactly 152 days. This can be interpreted as "00:00:00 on June 1, 2000" in whatever local time zone is associ­ ated with the value. That corresponds to the following times in ISO 8601 notation:

- 2000-06-01T00:00Z if the associated local time offset is 0 (i.e. the value is in UTC).

- 2000-05-31T23:00Z if the associated local time offset is +1 hour (e.g. the CET timezone, without daylight savings).

- 2000-06-01T00:00+02 if the associated local time offset is +1 hour.

- 2000-06-01T04:00Z if the associated local time offset is -4 hours (e.g. the EDT time zone, which includes daylight savings).

- 2000-06-01T00:00-04 if the associated local time offset is -4 hours.

> **Conversion from NTP timestamps**
>
> Timestamps from NTP also do not count leap seconds, but have a different epoch. NTP 128-bit time­ stamps consist of a 64-bit seconds portion (NTP(s)) and a 64-bit fractional seconds portion (NTP(frac)). NTP(s) at 00:00:00 can be calculated from the Modified Julian Day (MJD) as follows:
>
> NTP(s) = (MJD-15020) \* (24\*60\*60)
>
> where 15020 is the MJD on January 1, 1900 (the NTP epoch)
>
> NTP(s) on January 1, 2000 00:00:00 UTC (MJD = 51544) is 3155673600 (0xBC17C200)
>
> [Epoch Time](#epoch-time-in-microseconds-type) has a microsecond precision, and this precision can be achieved by using the most sig­ nificant 32 bits of the fractional portion (NTP(frac32)). Conversion between the 128-bit NTP time­ stamps and a UTC [Epoch Time in Microseconds](#epoch-time-in-microseconds-type) is as follows:
>
> UTC [Epoch Time](#epoch-time-in-microseconds-type) = (NTP(s) - 0xBC17C200)\*10^6 + ((NTP(frac32)\*10^6) / 2^32) where all numbers are treated as unsigned 64-bit integers and the division is integer division.

#### Epoch Time in Seconds Type

> This type has the same semantics as [Epoch Time in Microseconds](#epoch-time-in-microseconds-type), except that:

- the value encodes an offset in seconds, rather than microseconds;

- the value is encoded as an unsigned 32-bit scalar, rather than 64-bit.

> This type is employed where compactness of representation is important and where the resolution of seconds is still satisfactory.

#### POSIX Time in milliseconds Type

> This type represents an offset, in milliseconds, from the UNIX epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC), encoded as an unsigned 64-bit scalar value.
>
> This type is employed for compatibility reasons.

#### System Time in microseconds Type

> System time in microseconds is an unsigned 64-bit value representing the number of microseconds since boot.

#### System Time in milliseconds Type

> System time in milliseconds is an unsigned 64-bit value representing the number of milliseconds since boot.
>
> This type is employed for compatibility reasons.

#### Elapsed Time in seconds Type

> Elapsed time in seconds is an unsigned 32-bit value representing the time that has elapsed for an operation or other activity, as determined by the definition of the attribute using this type.

#### Temperature Type

> This type, derived from int16, represents a temperature on the Celsius scale with a resolution of 0.01°C.

- *value* = (*temperature in °C*) x 100

[TABLE]

> The range is constrained by absolute zero: -273.15°C to 327.67°C.
>
> **Conversion of Temperature Values for Display**
>
> When converting temperature values for display manufacturers SHOULD ensure that calculations
>
> **round** to the nearest representable value. Particular care is needed when using integer arithmetic.

[TABLE]

> **Sample Conversion Code**
>
> Sample code provided to ensure consistent Fahrenheit to Celsius and vice-versa conversion between devices and across vendors.
>
> For degF: the value is a int8u representing 2x temperature value in Fahrenheit (to get 0.5 resolution).
>
> For degC: the value is a int16s representing Celsius in
>
> 0.01 resolution as expected by the ZCL format.

[TABLE]

[TABLE]

#### Power Type

> This type, derived from int64, represents power measured in milliwatts.

#### Amperage Type

> This type, derived from int64, represents amperage measured in milliamps.

#### Voltage Type

> This type, derived from int64, represents voltage measured in millivolts.

#### Energy Type

> This type, derived from int64, represents energy measured in milliwatt-hours.

#### Enumeration Type (8-bit, 16-bit)

> This data type employs scalars to represent context-specific values available from an enumerated set. This data type is nullable.
>
> A data field of this type SHALL have well-defined values with well-defined conformance for imple­ mentation. A base cluster that requires derivation MAY defer the definition of all or some enumer­ ated values to the derivation that can be implemented. Such a base cluster MAY also define con­ straints, such as ranges and semantics of those ranges for the enumeration.
>
> Values for an enumeration MAY be defined directly in a cluster specification, in a derived cluster specification, or in a separate namespace defined in the cluster specification. For examples, please see uses of the [SemanticTagStruct](#semantictagstruct-type) data type that supports many (and any) standard namespaces.
>
> Undefined values or ranges SHALL be considered reserved and SHALL NOT be implemented.
>
> External standards may be referenced as well as listing the values for the external standard. If the external standard adds values after a specification is adopted, those new values are allowed, but optional.
>
> Enumeration values are defined in a table with a Conformance column. When the definition of an enumeration is missing a Conformance column, all values SHALL be considered to have mandatory conformance.
>
> All mandatory readable enumeration values SHALL be understood by the client. All mandatory writable enumeration values SHALL be understood by the server.
>
> If a client indicates an enumeration value to the server, that is not supported by the server, because it is optional, deprecated, or a new value unrecognized by a legacy server, then the server SHALL respond with the status code CONSTRAINT_ERROR, unless the cluster defines alternate behavior, such as:

- convert the value to a mandatory value

- ignore the value

- generate a cluster specific error

> With regard to revising a cluster specification:

- It is RECOMMENDED that a client be as strict as possible by indicating only values that a server supports.

- It is RECOMMENDED that the server be as forgiving as possible when processing unsupported values.

> Note that indicated enumerations MAY comprise only a strict subset of the required enumerations.

[TABLE]

> **8-bit Enumeration**
>
> This type is used for enumeration types that need no more than 256 possible values.

16. **bit Enumeration**

> This type is used for enumeration types that need more than 256 (but less than 65,536) possible val­ ues.

#### Priority Type

> This is an enumeration of priority used to tag events and possibly other data. The data type does not define any particular ordering among the values. Specific uses of the data type may assign semantics to the values that imply an ordering relationship.

| **Value** | **Priority** | **Description** |
|----|----|----|
| 0 | **DEBUG** | Information for engineering debugging/troubleshooting |
| 1 | **INFO** | Information that either drives customer facing features or pro­ vides insights into device func­ tions that are used to drive ana­ lytics use cases |
| 2 | **CRITICAL** | Information or notification that impacts safety, a critical func­ tion, or ongoing reliable opera­ tion of the node or application supported on an endpoint. |

#### Status Code Type

> An enumeration value that means a success or error status. A status code is indicated as a response to an action in an interaction (see [Interaction Model](#chapter-8.-interaction-model-specification)).
>
> A status code SHALL be one of:

- a common status code from the set defined in the [Interaction Model status code table](#status-code-table);

- a cluster status code that is scoped to a particular cluster.

> The following table defines the enumeration ranges for status codes.

| **Status Code Range** | **Description** |
|----|----|
| 0x00 | common status code: SUCCESS |
| 0x01 | common status code: FAILURE |
| 0x02 to 0x10 | cluster scoped status codes |
| 0x70 to 0xCF | other common status codes defined in [Interac­](#status-code-table) [tion Model Status Code Table](#status-code-table). |

> Status codes in an undefined range, or status codes undefined within a range are reserved and SHALL NOT be indicated.

#### Fabric ID Type

> A value to identify a fabric.

#### Fabric Index Type

> This is an index that maps to a particular fabric on the node, see [Fabric-Index](#fabric-index). It is used for:

- the [accessing fabric index](#_bookmark691) of an interaction

- the [FabricIndex global field](#fabricindex-field) in [fabric-scoped data](#fabric-scoped-data)

#### Node ID Type

> A [64-bit ID for a node](#node-identifier) scoped and unique to a particular fabric as indicated by an accompanying [fabric-index](#fabric-index-type) adjacent instantiation.

#### Group ID Type

> A [16-bit ID for a group](#group-identifier-gid) scoped to a particular fabric as indicated by an accompanying [fabric index](#fabric-index-type) adjacent instantiation.

#### Endpoint Number Type

> An unsigned number that indicates an instance of a [device type](#device-type). Endpoint numbers SHALL NOT be 0xFFFF, to allow all endpoint number values to be expressible in nullable endpoint-no fields.

#### Vendor ID Type

> A [Vendor ID](#vendor-identifier-vendor-id-vid).
>
> Vendor IDs MAY be used as a prefix in a [Manufacturer Extensible Identifier](#manufacturer-extensible-identifiers) format.

#### Device Type ID Type

> An identifier that indicates conformance to a [device type](#device-type).
>
> Device Type IDs SHALL be a [Manufacturer Extensible Identifier](#manufacturer-extensible-identifiers). The specifics of its representation are described in [Data Model Types](#data-model-types).

#### Cluster ID Type

> An identifier that indicates conformance to a cluster specification.
>
> Cluster IDs SHALL be a [Manufacturer Extensible Identifier](#manufacturer-extensible-identifiers). The specifics of its representation are described in [Data Model Types](#data-model-types).

#### Attribute ID Type

> An identifier that indicates an attribute defined in a cluster specification.
>
> Attribute IDs SHALL be a [Manufacturer Extensible Identifier](#manufacturer-extensible-identifiers). The specifics of its representation are described in [Data Model Types](#data-model-types).

#### Field ID Type

> An identifier that indicates a field defined in a struct.
>
> Field IDs SHALL be a [Manufacturer Extensible Identifier](#manufacturer-extensible-identifiers). The specifics of its representation are described in [Data Model Types](#data-model-types).

#### Event ID Type

> An identifier that indicates an [Event](#event) defined in a cluster specification.
>
> Event IDs SHALL be a [Manufacturer Extensible Identifier](#manufacturer-extensible-identifiers). The specifics of its representation are described in [Data Model Types](#data-model-types).

#### Command ID Type

> An identifier that indicates a [command](#command) defined in a cluster specification.
>
> Command IDs SHALL be a [Manufacturer Extensible Identifier](#manufacturer-extensible-identifiers). The specifics of its representation are described in [Data Model Types](#data-model-types).

#### Action ID Type

> An identifier that indicates an action as defined in the [Interaction Model](#chapter-8.-interaction-model-specification) specification.

#### Transaction ID Type

> An identifier for a transaction as defined in the [Interaction Model](#chapter-8.-interaction-model-specification) specification, see [Transaction ID](#transaction-id).

#### Entry Index Type

> This is an index for a [list data type](#list).

#### Data Version Type

> An unsigned number that indicates a [Data Version Type](#data-version-type).

#### Event Number Type

> An unsigned number that indicates an [Event](#event) instance.

#### Character String Type

> The character string data type is derived from an octet string. The octets SHALL be characters with UTF-8 encoding. An instance of this data type SHALL NOT contain truncated code points.
>
> Note that the character string type is a bounded sequence of characters whose size bound format is not specified in the data model, but rather a property of the underlying encoding. Therefore, no assumptions are to be made about the presence or absence of a length prefix or null-terminator byte, or other implementation considerations.
>
> It is RECOMMENDED to define constraints on the maximum possible string length.
>
> If at least one of the code points within the string has value 31 (0x1F), which is Unicode INFORMATION SEPARATOR 1 and ASCII Unit Separator, then any client making use of the string SHALL only consider the code points that appear before the first INFORMATION SEPARATOR 1 as being the textual informa­ tion carried by the string. Any comparison between such a string and other strings SHALL use the textual component before the first INFORMATION SEPARATOR 1. The remainder of the character string after a first INFORMATION SEPARATOR 1 is reserved for future use by this specification. Implementa­ tions of this version of the specification SHALL NOT produce character strings containing INFORMA­ TION SEPARATOR 1.

#### IP Address Types

> Either an IPv4 or an IPv6 address as defined below.

#### IPv4 Address Type

> The IPv4 address data type is derived from an octet string. The octets SHALL correspond to the four octets in network byte order that comprise an IPv4 address represented utilizing quad-dotted nota­ tion.
>
> Examples of encoding:

- Address 192.168.2.235 → C0A802EB

- Address 10.4.200.75 → 0A04C84B

#### IPv6 Address

> The IPv6 address data type is derived from an octet string. The octets SHALL correspond to the full 16 octets that comprise an IPv6 address as defined by [RFC 4291](#_bookmark51). The octets SHALL be presented in network byte order.
>
> Examples of encoding:

- Address 2001:DB8:0:0:8:800:200C:417A → 20010DB80000000000080800200C417A

- Address 2001:0DB8:1122:3344:5566:7788:99AA:BBCC → 20010DB8112233445566778899AABBCC

#### IPv6 Prefix

> The IPv6 prefix data type is derived from an octet string. The octets SHALL be encoded such that:

- The first octet SHALL encode the prefix length, in bits, in the range of 0 to 128.

  - A value of 0 indicates an absent/invalid prefix.

- The subsequent octets SHALL encode the contiguous leftmost bits of the prefix, in network byte order, with left justification, such that the first bit of the prefix is in the most significant bit of the first octet. Encoding SHOULD use the least number of bytes to encode the prefix but MAY include unused trailing zeroes.

> Examples of encoding:

- Preferred minimal encoding: Prefix 2001:0DB8:0:CD30::/60 → 9 octets → 3C20010DB80000CD30

- Preferred minimal encoding: Prefix 2001:0DB8:BB00::/40 → 6 octets → 2820010DB8BB

- Allowed non-minimal encoding: Prefix 2001:0DB8:BB00::/40 → 7 octets → 2820010DB8BB00

#### Hardware Address Type

> The Hardware Address data type SHALL be either a 48-bit IEEE MAC Address or a 64-bit IEEE MAC Address (e.g. EUI-64). The order of bytes is Big-Endian or display mode, where the first byte in the string is the left most or highest order byte.

#### SemanticTagStruct Type

> This data type SHALL be represented by the following structure:

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Access** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | MfgCode | vendor-id |  | X | null |  | M |
| 1 | Name­ spaceID | namespace |  |  |  |  | M |
| 2 | Tag | tag |  |  |  |  | M |
| 3 | Label | string | max 64 | X | null |  | MfgCode != null, O |

> **MfgCode Field**
>
> If the MfgCode field is not null, it SHALL be the [Vendor ID](#vendor-identifier-vendor-id-vid) of the manufacturer who has defined a certain namespace and the NamespaceID field SHALL be the ID of a namespace defined by the manufacturer identified in the MfgCode field.
>
> If a manufacturer specific Tag field is indicated in a list of SemanticTagStruct entries, the list SHALL include at least one standard tag which is not from any manufacturer’s namespace. A standard tag is a tag from a common namespace, a derived cluster namespace, or an applicable device-specific namespace.
>
> If MfgCode is null, the NamespaceID field SHALL indicate a standard namespace.
>
> **NamespaceID Field**
>
> The NamespaceID field SHALL identify a namespace.
>
> The common and device-specific semantic tag namespaces are listed in [StandardNamespaces](#_bookmark14).
>
> **Tag Field**
>
> The Tag field SHALL be the ID of a semantic tag located within the namespace indicated by Name­ spaceID.
>
> A device MAY expose tags from the common or device-specific namespaces and from manufac­ turer-specific namespaces in a single [TagList](#taglist-attribute).
>
> **Label Field**
>
> The Label field, if present, SHALL contain human-readable text suitable for display on a client. The content of the Label field is defined by the manufacturer.
>
> This field SHALL be present when the MfgCode is not null. This field SHOULD NOT be used if the Tag is from a standard namespace, unless the Tag requires further qualification. For example: A Tag that has the meaning of "room" in a location namespace, would require the a label string to qualify the type of room, such as "1", "2b", "Bathroom", etc.

#### Namespace Type

> The Namespace type identifies the namespace used for a semantic tag.

#### Tag Type

> The Tag type SHALL identify a semantic tag located within a namespace.

#### LocationDescriptorStruct

> This data type SHALL be represented by the following structure:

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **Location­ Name** | string | max 128 |  |  | M |
| 1 | **FloorNum­ ber** | int16 |  | X |  | M |
| 2 | **AreaType** | tag |  | X |  | M |

> **LocationName Field**
>
> This field SHALL indicate the name of the location. For example, "blue room".
>
> If the location name is not user provided, the logic that generates it (clients, devices etc.) SHOULD utilize synthesized user-friendly, understandable, names for the location, rather than opaque val­ ues such as "private" or "2fe7c241-a50a-4863-896e-c5878da5ed68".
>
> **FloorNumber Field**
>
> This field SHALL indicate the level number. Negative values correspond to basement levels.
>
> Value zero indicates this is the main floor, which typically includes the main entrance to the user’s home. For a building with multiple levels, it is the client’s responsibility to map each level to/from a FloorNumber tag value, using the level numbering convention of the region where the client oper­ ates. For example, if the client operates in Europe, building level 1, which is one level up from the street level, SHOULD be mapped to FloorNumber tag value 0x1. If the client operates in North America, building level 1, which is at street level, SHOULD be mapped to FloorNumber tag value 0x0.
>
> A null value indicates that this information is not available.
>
> When the clients present the level information for user selection, they SHOULD use the operating region to determine how to render and map this data. For example, if the client operates in North America it SHOULD present the user a list that includes entries labeled "basement", "first", "second", and internally mapped to floor numbers -1, 0, and 1. If operating in Europe, the client SHOULD present a list that includes entries labeled "basement", "ground", "first", internally mapped to floor numbers -1, 0, and 1.
>
> The floor number information is expected to be mostly useful to the clients, rather than the devices, such as for grouping devices that are located on the same level. For example, an automation may be defined for all devices located at the basement level (floor number -1).
>
> **NOTE** Handling complex level situations, such as half levels (side split houses), or the lev­ els from an apartment building, is up to the client and/or user.
>
> **AreaType Field**
>
> This field SHALL be the ID of an area semantic tag, located within the [Common Area Namespace](#_bookmark14). For example, this tag may indicate that the location refers to a bedroom.
>
> If this field is null, that indicates that the area type information is not available.
>
> **NOTE** This field only indicates the type of the area. Multiple areas of the same type, such as bedrooms, MAY exist in a user’s home.

## Manufacturer Specific Extensions

> This section covers Manufacturer Specific (MS) extensions and how they are supported by identi­ fiers, paths, wildcards, discoverability, etc.

### Manufacturer Extensible Identifiers

> A Manufacturer Extensible Context (MEC) contains a collection of items which MAY be extended by manufacturers. Each item in a MEC has a source which is either Standard, Scoped or a particular Manufacturer Code (MC).

- A Standard source references definitions described in Matter standard clusters.

- A Scoped source adopts the same source as that of the cluster that contains its definition.

- An MC-based source references manufacturer-specific definitions.

> *Table 75. MEC Example*

[TABLE]

> A Manufacturer Extensible Identifier (MEI) identifies an item in an MEC and has no meaning beyond the context of that MEC.

### Manufacturer Extensible Identifier (MEI)

> An MEI has the following format:
>
> *Table 76. MEI Format*

[TABLE]

> The MEI permits encoding of ~65K keys in the suffix.
>
> A specific MEI MAY only permit certain combinations of the above.

#### Encoding

> The MEI prefix encodes the source [Vendor ID](#vendor-identifier-vendor-id-vid) and follows the same rules as outlined in [Table 1,](#_bookmark110) [“Vendor ID Allocations”](#_bookmark110), with the exception that a Scoped source is encoded using the same prefix as a Standard source. Consequently, a given MEI SHALL NOT permit both Standard and Scoped source types given the ambiguity in telling them apart.
>
> Given the above, the encoding is as follows:
>
> *Table 77. MEI Prefix*

[TABLE]

> The MEI suffix encodes a key as follows:
>
> *Table 78. MEI Suffix*

[TABLE]

#### Data Model Types

> The following data model types SHALL be represented as MEIs:
>
> *Table 79. MEI Suffix*

[TABLE]

[TABLE]

> For those types which are listed with an 8 bit suffix range in this table (i.e. Event ID, Command ID and Field ID), the 16-bit MEI Suffix SHALL be constructed by padding the 8-bit data with a most sig­ nificant byte set to zero.
>
> For example:
>
> *Table 80. MEI Decoding Example*

[TABLE]

### Manufacturer Extensions

> A manufacturer extensible context MAY be extended with items from any manufacturer. Such extensions SHALL be identified using an MEI with prefix for that particular manufacturer, and SHALL NOT use a standard/scoped prefix.
>
> There are further constraints:

- MS extensions SHALL only be permitted on standard clusters or another existing MS extension of a standard cluster from another manufacturer.

- An extended cluster MAY instantiate a struct definition defined in the standard cluster.

- A struct that has been extended with new fields SHALL have the same definition in all instances of that struct within a given cluster definition.

- A defined element (struct, command, event) SHALL NOT be re-used or instantiable in a different cluster (except in extended clusters)

> This is illustrated by the following hypothetical scenario.
>
> Suppose the standard provides cluster ABCD which contains related counters and their recent statis­ tics. The counter values are available as attributes 1 and 2, which are reset daily. The statistics are grouped into a SummarizedStats struct, available as attributes 3 and 4, and track summary statistics for each counter over a recent period (last month). Each instance of the statistics struct has fields 1, 2, and 3, for minimum, maximum, and mean values for that period.
>
> Suppose manufacturer A extends the standard cluster with additional statistics (marked with ¹ below). A adds lifetime counts as attributes 0x000A_0001 and 0x000A_0002, which are never reset. A also adds quartiles Q1, Q2, and Q3 to the standard SummarizedStats struct, as fields 0x000A_0001, 0x000A_0002, and 0x000A_0003. These quartiles are available for all existing instances of the standard struct, such as standard attributes 3 and 4.
>
> Suppose manufacturer B, a partner of manufacturer A, extends the standard cluster further (marked with ² below). B wishes to add instances of the standard statistics struct, as attributes 0x000B_0001 and 0x000B_0002, to track summary statistics for each counter, over a different recent period (last year instead of last month). Since manufacturer A had already extended the standard statistics struct, the instantiation of that struct will contain both standard and A’s fields. If B desires to create a new version of that statistics struct without A’s changes, it would have to declare a new definition of that struct with new fields in it.
>
> Suppose manufacturer C, a partner of manufacturers B and A, adds a MS cluster 0x000C_FC01 (marked with ³ below) that doesn’t extend an existing standard cluster. This cluster has a sensor available as attribute 0x0000_0001 of type SensorStats, which has fields 0x0000_0001, 0x0000_0002, and 0x0000_0003, for the sensor’s value, precision, and accuracy. Since Attribute and Field IDs are defined using the 'Scoped' source type, the prefix of '0000' implicitly equates to the same source as the cluster it is defined in, i.e Manufacturer C. C also wishes to add an instance of the Summarized­ Stats struct as attribute 0x000C_0002, to track summary statistics for the sensor over a recent period (last hour). Since this cluster does not extend any previous cluster, it cannot instantiate any of the extended versions of the SummarizedStats struct as defined previously. Instead, C will have re-define that structure definition within its cluster definition and use it.

### Discoverability

> The Descriptor Cluster reports the device types and clusters on a node’s endpoints, whether they are standard or from a particular manufacturer.
>
> For example, if a node supports cluster 0x000C_ABCD on endpoints 1 and 2, that information is avail­ able in the Descriptor Cluster.
>
> The Read Interaction provides a means to read the contents of all or part of a cluster.
>
> For example, reading cluster 0x0000_ABCD on endpoint 1 might return mandatory attribute
>
> 0x0000_0001, optional attribute 0x0000_0009, and MS attributes 0x000A_0001 and 0x000A_0002.

# Chapter 8. Interaction Model Specification

## Practical Information

### Revision History

> Please note that Matter revision 1.0 SHALL be considered equivalent to revision 10.

| Revision | Description |
|----|----|
| 1 | Equivalent to revision 10 (1^(st) Matter release of the Interaction Model) |
| 2-9 | Released as versions of the Zigbee Cluster Library chapter 2 which combined the interac­ tion model with encoding |
| 10 | Initial release of this specification (Matter 1.0) |
| 11 | Updated Event error processing (Matter 1.2) |
| 12 | Added WildcardPathFlags to AttributeDataIB, and associated behavior; added support for mul­ tiple CommandDataIB in one Invoke Request (Matter 1.3) |

### Scope & Purpose

> This is part of a package of Data Model specifications that are agnostic to underlying layers (encod­ ing, message, network, transport, etc.). Each specification below may be independently maintained. This package, as a whole, SHALL be independently maintained as agnostic and decoupled from lower layers. This package may be referenced by inclusion in vertical protocol stack specifications.
>
> **[Data Model](#chapter-7.-data-model-specification)** Defines first order elements and namespace for endpoints, clusters, attributes, data types, etc.
>
> **[Interaction Model](#chapter-8.-interaction-model-specification)** Defines interactions, transactions and actions between nodes.
>
> **[System Model](#chapter-9.-system-model-specification)** Defines relationships that are managed between endpoints and clusters.
>
> **Cluster Library** Reference library of cluster specifications.
>
> **Device Library** Reference library of devices type definitions.

### Origin Story

> The original baseline for this section comes from the Zigbee Cluster Library \[[ZCL](#_bookmark91)\] Chapter 2 relat­ ing to ZCL commands and interactions. This specification addresses these gaps determined by the Data Model Tiger Team:

- Multi-Element Message support

  - Synchronized Reporting

  - Reduce message types (commands & actions)

  - Complex data type support in all messages

  - Events

  - Interception attack

### Purpose

> The purpose is to define a layer that abstracts interactions from other layers, including security, transport, message format & encoding. The intent is that this document will align with current clus­ ter specifications in the ZCL (revision 8 at this time), and still support cluster evolution over time.

### Conventions & Conformance

> Please see the [Data Model](#chapter-7.-data-model-specification) specification.

## Concepts

> Relationships between devices are established using data model elements and interactions defined here. Please see the [System Model](#chapter-9.-system-model-specification) specification for more information.
>
> An interaction is a sequence of transactions. A transaction is a sequence of actions.
>
> An action is a single logical communication from a source node to one or more destination nodes. An action is conveyed by one or more messages.
>
> The actual construction and encoding of messages is left to the message layer, which is the layer below this layer.

- The protocol layers below this layer MAY have constraints that only support a subset of the functionality described here.

[TABLE]

### Path

> A path is used to indicate one or more element instances in the data model. The path has the form as described in Augmented Backus–Naur:

[TABLE]

[TABLE]

> An [Attribute Path](#attribute-path) is a path indicating an \<attribute\>. A [Command Path](#command-path) is a path indicating a \<command\>.
>
> An [Event Path](#event-path) is a path indicating an \<event\>.

#### Concrete Path

- A concrete path SHALL NOT have group IDs or wildcards.

- A concrete path SHALL indicate a single element instance that is either:

  - an event with the path ending in an event ID

  - a command with the path ending in a command ID

  - an attribute with the path ending in an attribute ID

  - a struct field with the path ending in a field ID

  - a list entry with the path ending in a list entry index.

#### Existent Path

- An existent path is a concrete path that indicates a single existing instance on the node indi­ cated in the path.

#### Group Path

> A group path is a path that targets endpoints that are members of a group, using group ID, instead of indicating a node and endpoint.

- A group path SHALL resolve into zero or more paths.

- A group path SHALL include a group ID that indicates zero or more endpoints that are members of the group.

- A group path MAY include a wildcard cluster indication and therefore also be a [Wildcard Path](#wildcard-path).

#### Wildcard Path

> A wildcard path is a path with a wildcard endpoint indication and/or wildcard cluster indication.

- A wildcard path SHALL resolve into zero or more paths.

- A wildcard path SHALL indicate zero or more element instances.

- A wildcard path MAY include a group ID and therefore also be a [Group Path](#group-path).

#### Request Path

> A request path is used in actions that request data model elements.

- A request path SHALL be either a concrete path, a group path or a wildcard path.

#### Request Path Expansion

> Many actions specify this process step to expand a request path into a list of existent paths. This process does not check access qualities, such as read or write access, privileges, or fabric qualities.

- If the path is a [Group Path](#group-path), it SHALL be replaced with a list of paths, one for each endpoint that is a member of the group on the target node.

  - All concrete paths that are not existent paths in the list generated by the above-mentioned group-to-endpoint path expansion SHALL be removed.

- Else the list SHALL be the path.

- Each path in the list that is a [Wildcard Path](#wildcard-path) SHALL be replaced with a complete list of existent paths, which are the permutations from substituting the wildcarded elements with existent ele­ ments, but excluding the paths that must be omitted due to processing of the [Attribute Wildcard](#_bookmark862) [Path Flags](#_bookmark862).

> This process produces zero or more existent paths.

#### Attribute Path

> An attribute path is used to indicate all or part of a cluster attribute. An attribute path may indicate deeper parts of [collection type data](#_bookmark796).
>
> Associated Information Block: [AttributePathIB](#attributepathib)
>
> If the attribute data type is a [collection data type](#_bookmark796), such as a struct or list, then the path may indicate deeper nested parts of the data.
>
> The nesting of [collection data](#_bookmark796) is conceptually unlimited, but the actual structure of the data is well- defined in the cluster specification. Attribute data structures are similar to data structures sup­ ported in a programming language (see [Data Types](#data-types) in the Data Model specification). An attribute path is conceptually similar to the path or dot notation used to reference programming language data structures.
>
> A field ID for structure data or an entry index for list data are currently the only options in an attribute path, after the attribute ID itself.

- The \<attribute\> component of an attribute path SHALL have the following form:

> ^(\*) \<nesting level\> occurs zero or more times as defined in a cluster specification.
>
> The endpoint component is subject to wildcard expansion, as constrained in particular actions and contexts.
>
> **Attribute Wildcard Path Flags**
>
> Processing wildcard expansion of an Attribute Path MAY be affected by the associated Wildcard­ PathFlags field.
>
> When expanding a wildcard path indicated in an [AttributePathIB](#attributepathib) into one or more concrete paths, paths SHALL be omitted from the result set if they satisfy any of the conditions below, each of which depends on the value of [WildcardPathFlags](#wildcardpathflagsbitmap) and the path being considered:

- if the WildcardSkipRootNode bit is set and the concrete path targets endpoint 0;

- if the WildcardSkipGlobalAttributes bit is set and the concrete path refers to one of the following attribute IDs:

  - GeneratedCommandList/0xFFF8

  - AcceptedCommandList/0xFFF9

  - AttributeList/0xFFFB

- if the WildcardSkipAttributeList bit is set and the concrete path refers to the AttributeList (ID 0xFFFB) attribute;

- if the WildcardSkipCommandLists bit is set and the concrete path refers to the either the Generat­ edCommandList (ID 0xFFF8) or AcceptedCommandList (ID 0xFFF9) attributes;

- if the WildcardSkipCustomElements bit is set, and the concrete path targets:

  - any element whose Cluster ID has an [MEI prefix](#encoding) not equal to zero;

  - any attribute whose ID has an [MEI prefix](#encoding) not equal to zero, even if included in a standard cluster;

- if the WildcardSkipFixedAttributes bit is set and the concrete path refers to an attribute with the Fixed (F) quality;

- if the WildcardSkipChangesOmittedAttributes bit is set and the concrete path refers to an attribute with the Changes Omitted (C) quality;

- if the WildcardSkipDiagnosticsClusters bit is set and the concrete path refers to a cluster with the [Diagnostics (K) quality](#diagnostics-quality).

> If the client is including WildcardPathFlags in an AttributePathIB destined to a server that pre-dates the introduction of WildcardPathFlags (Interaction Model revision 12), the client SHALL tolerate the inclusion of reports for paths that would otherwise be omitted by servers compliant with this feature.
>
> **NOTE** WildcardPathFlags support is provisional.

#### Command Path

> A command path is used to indicate a cluster command. Associated Information Block: [CommandPathIB](#commandpathib)

- The \<command\> component of a command path SHALL have the following form:

- The endpoint field is wildcardable, though this may be disallowed in the various uses of the Command Path in different actions and contexts.

#### Event Path

> A event path is used to indicate a cluster event. Associated Information Block: [EventPathIB](#_bookmark912)

- The \<event\> component of an event path SHALL have the following form:

> Please see [Event](#event) for a description of a cluster event and event data fields.
>
> The endpoint, cluster and event ID fields are wildcardable. These are further constrained in the various uses of the Event Path in different actions and contexts.

- An event path SHALL NOT be a group path.

### Interaction

> An interaction is a sequence of one or more transactions between nodes, that occurs in the context of an [accessing fabric](#accessing-fabric), or no fabric.
>
> How a fabric, or no fabric, context is established for an interaction, is not defined here.
>
> The first transaction (of an interaction) starts with the first action from the node called the **initia­ tor**. The first action destination is called the **target**, which is either a node or group. For the remain­ der of the interaction, the initiator remains the same.
>
> An interaction may be a single transaction (e.g. Read). An interaction may be an unbounded num­ ber of transactions (e.g. Subscribe).

| **Interaction** | **Transactions** | **Description** |
|----|----|----|
| [**Read Interaction**](#read-interaction) | Read | This interaction is a request for cluster attributes and/or event data. |
| [**Subscribe Interaction**](#subscribe-interaction) | Subscribe, Report | This interaction subscribes to cluster attributes and/or event data. |
| [**Write Interaction**](#write-interaction) | Write | This interaction modifies clus­ ter attributes. |

| **Interaction** | **Transactions** | **Description** |
|----|----|----|
| [**Invoke Interaction**](#invoke-interaction) | Invoke | This interaction invokes cluster commands. |

### Transaction

> A transaction is either the whole, or part of an interaction. A transaction is a sequence of one or more actions. Actions in a transaction are defined as first or following, to better describe dependen­ cies in this specification.

- The first action of a transaction SHALL be initiated by a single node.

- An action in a transaction SHALL have a target destination that is either a single node, called a unicast action or a group of nodes, called groupcast action.

#### Transaction ID

> The transaction ID is a field present in all actions (see [Common Action Information](#common-action-information)) that indicates the logical grouping of those actions.

- All following actions in a transaction SHALL have the same transaction ID as the first action.

- A groupcast action SHALL end a transaction and any subsequent action in the interaction SHALL NOT use the same transaction ID.

> The table below lists all transactions.

| **Transaction** | **Description** |
|----|----|
| [**Read Transaction**](#read-transaction) | This transaction is a request for cluster attribute and/or event data. |
| [**Subscribe Transaction**](#subscribe-transaction) | This transaction creates a subscription to cluster attributes and/or events. |
| [**Report Transaction**](#report-transaction) | This transaction maintains a subscription for the Subscribe interaction. |
| [**Write Transaction**](#write-transaction) | This transaction modifies cluster attributes. |
| [**Invoke Transaction**](#invoke-transaction) | This transaction invokes cluster commands. |

### Action

> The table below lists all actions.

| **Action** | **Description** | **Outgoing Message** |
|----|----|----|
| [**Status Response Action**](#status-response-action) | This action is a success or error response. | Unicast |
| [**Read Request Action**](#read-request-action) | This action is a request for clus­ ter attribute data and/or events. | Unicast |

| **Action** | **Description** | **Outgoing Message** |
|----|----|----|
| [**Report Data Action**](#report-data-action) | This action responds to a [Read](#read-request-action) [Request Action](#read-request-action) or [Subscribe](#subscribe-request-action) [Request Action](#subscribe-request-action). | Unicast |

### Common Action Behavior

> The message layer below this interaction layer encodes an action into one or more messages and delivers the messages to a destination. This interaction layer delivers action information to the mes­ sage layer by passing action information, through some interface (not defined here). The message layer delivers action information, from an incoming message, to this interaction layer.
>
> In all action descriptions in this specification, action information (or information blocks), refers to the information that is transferred to and from the message layer.
>
> There is no designation of mandatory or optional for such information because the implementation is undefined. However, some information fields may be omitted, meaning the information may not be needed for all actions.

#### Common Action Information

| **Action Field** | **Type** | **Conformance** | **Description** |
|----|----|----|----|
| **InteractionModelRevi­ sion** | uint8 | M | the revision number of the implemented Inter­ action Model specifica­ tion under which the sending node was certi­ fied |
| **Action** | action-id | M | the [action](#action) |
| **TransactionID** | trans-id | M | the [transaction ID](#transaction-id) |
| **FabricIndex** | fabric-idx | M | the [accessing fabric](#_bookmark691) [index](#_bookmark691), based on the ses­ sion used to deliver the action |
| **SourceNode** | node-id | M | the node ID of the node that generates the action |
| **DestinationNode** | node-id | O.a | the node ID of the desti­ nation where the action is sent |
| **DestinationGroup** | group-id | O.a | the group ID of the des­ tination where the action is sent |
| *action specific* | *variable* | M | specific action informa­ tion described in each action section |

1.  **Outgoing Action**

    - Each generated action SHALL provide the action information above to the message layer.

    - If the action is the first action of a transaction, the TransactionID SHALL be a value that uniquely identifies the transaction on the source of the action.

    - If the action is a following action, the TransactionID SHALL be the same as the TransactionID in the first action of the transaction.

    - If the action is a unicast following action the DestinationNode SHALL be the SourceNode of the previous action in the transaction.

    - The generated action information SHALL be submitted to the message layer.

      - Upon receipt of this action information, the message layer SHALL construct and convey one or more messages for this action to the target.

      - If the message layer encounters an error that prevents the complete construction, encoding and/or conveyance of the action, then the message layer SHALL inform this layer of the error.

      - If the action is not completely conveyed, the action, with the associated transaction and

> interaction, SHALL terminate.

- If the failed action is NOT a Status Response action, this layer SHOULD, if possible, sub­ mit a Status Response action to the message layer, with a status code of FAILURE and the same TransactionID.

#### Incoming Action

- If the message layer receives a valid message for an action, it SHALL be delivered to this layer with the action information above.

- If this layer receives a message for an action that is not expected semantically, has invalid action information, or has an error not described in this specification, a Status Response action with an INVALID_ACTION Status Code SHALL be generated as defined in [Status Response Action](#status-response-action), and the associated transaction and interaction SHALL terminate.

- If during the receipt and decoding of messages for an action by the message layer, an error occurs that prevents a complete receipt of a valid action, then the message layer SHALL inform this layer of the error.

  - When informed of an error from a message layer, the action, with the associated transaction and interaction, SHALL terminate.

- If the action is not able to be executed due to insufficient resources, a Status Response SHALL be sent to the initiator with a status code of either:

  - PATHS_EXHAUSTED if there are not enough resources to support the number of paths in the action information,

  - and the number of paths in the action exceeds the number of paths that is guaranteed to be supported for the action (see [Interaction Model Limits](#interaction-model-limits)),

  - BUSY in all other recoverable resource exhausted situations (e.g. if too many Read interac­ tions are already in progress),

  - or RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED for any other resource insufficiency,

  - and the interaction SHALL be terminated.

> It is implementation specific whether the message layer submits logical parts of an action to this layer as it receives and processes each message. The only requirement above is that all the informa­ tion, or an error, be submitted to this layer.
>
> Global common interaction Status Codes are defined in this document in [Status Codes](#status-codes-1). Cluster spe­ cific Status Codes are defined in each cluster specification.

## Status and Interaction

> There is no Status interaction, but an error status may be generated as part of any interaction.

### Status Response Action

> This action is defined as a following action for some actions, or is generated when there is an unspecified transaction or interaction error. This action conveys status to this layer or conveys sta­
>
> tus from this layer to another node. The status indicates success or an error as part of a transaction or interaction.
>
> Please see [Common Action Behavior](#common-action-behavior) for behavior common to all actions. The specific action infor­ mation for this action is shown below.

#### Status Response Information

    - This action SHALL be unicast.

    - This action SHALL NOT be generated in response to a groupcast.

    - This action SHALL be generated as specified in interactions defined here.

    - If this action is generated with an error Status, the current transaction and interaction SHALL be terminated.

    - This action SHALL only be generated with an error Status when an error occurs as a result of the immediate previous received action in the current transaction.

    - This action’s DestinationNode field SHALL be the immediate previous received action’s SourceNode.

    - This action’s TransactionID field SHALL be the immediate previous received action’s Transac­ tionID.

    - If there is no well-defined Status Code for an error or exception, the Status Code of FAILURE SHALL be used.

#### Incoming Status Response Action

- Upon receipt of this action with a success Status Code, this layer SHALL consume the status and continue the current transaction and interaction.

- Upon receipt of this action with an error Status, this layer SHALL terminate the current transac­ tion and interaction.

- Upon receipt of this action with an error Status, this layer SHALL submit the error to the layer above.

1.  **Incoming Read Request and Subscribe Request Action Processing**

    - Each path indicated by the Report Data action SHALL be a [Concrete Path](#concrete-path).

    - Each request path in the AttributeRequests field SHALL be processed as follows:

      - If the path does not conform to [Valid Read Attribute Paths](#valid-read-attribute-paths) then:

        - a Status Response with the INVALID_ACTION Status Code SHALL be generated as defined in [Status Response Action](#status-response-action),

  - Else an [AttributeDataIB](#attributedataib) SHALL be generated with the Data and Path as indicated by the path being processed. If the attribute indicated by the path or any struct field nested inside that attribute (at any level of nesting) is a fabric-scoped list, then any such list within the gener­ ated Data shall be filtered based on the value of the FabricFiltered parameter:

    - If the FabricFiltered parameter is true, any such list SHALL be generated as a [fabric-fil­](#_bookmark802) [tered list](#_bookmark802) of entries.

        - If the event record path does not match a path in the remaining existent event paths.

        - If the event record path is [fabric-sensitive](#fabric-sensitive-quality), and the [associated fabric](#_bookmark693) does not match the [accessing fabric](#accessing-fabric).

- This action MAY have an empty list of AttributeReports and/or EventReports.

&nbsp;

- This action SHALL NOT include any nested attribute data field or nested event data field that is defined as fabric-sensitive, if the [associated fabric](#_bookmark693) for that field does not match the [accessing](#accessing-fabric) [fabric](#accessing-fabric) for the interaction.

- SuppressResponse MAY be set to TRUE for a Report Data action that initiates a Report transac­ tion that conveys an empty list of AttributeReports and EventReports, otherwise:

  - SuppressResponse SHALL be set to TRUE for a Report Data action that is part of a Read transaction.

  - SuppressResponse SHALL be set to FALSE for a Report Data action that is part of a Subscribe transaction.

- This action SHALL be generated as either:

  - part of a Read transaction in direct response to a Read Request action.

  - part of a Subscribe transaction in direct response to a Subscribe Request action.

  - part of a Subscribe interaction as the first action of each synchronized [Report Transaction](#report-transaction).

#### Incoming Report Data Action

- Upon receipt of this action, if SuppressResponse is TRUE, a response SHALL NOT be generated;

- Otherwise a [Status Response Action](#status-response-action) SHALL be generated with a status code of

  - SUCCESS to continue the interaction,

  - INVALID_SUBSCRIPTION if the action is part of a Subscribe interaction and the Subscrip­ tionID is invalid,

  - FAILURE to terminate the interaction,

  - The [Status Response Action](#status-response-action) SHALL be submitted to the message layer to deliver to the source of this action.

## Subscribe Interaction

> The Subscribe interaction is composed of these transactions:

| **Transaction** | **Description** |
|----|----|
| **Subscribe** | start and prime a reporting session |
| **Report** | synchronized [Report transaction](#report-transaction) |
| *more reports* | continuous Report transactions for the life of the subscription |

> This interaction allows a subscriber to create a subscription with a publisher on another node for the purposes of receiving data reports from that publisher thereafter, for the duration of the sub­ scription. This allows the subscriber to maintain a coherent snapshot, or twin, of the subscription data as it currently exists on the publisher. The session itself is kept synchronized on both sides through the receipt of timely data reports with the intervals defined by a negotiated maximum interval subscription parameter.
>
> This interaction is started when the initiator (or subscriber), wishes to subscribe to one or more attributes or events located on a target node (the publisher). The attribute data and events requested in the [Subscribe transaction](#subscribe-transaction) are the subscription data.
>
> This interaction starts by creating a subscription with a Subscribe transaction, which primes the subscriber with initial subscription data. The rest of the subscription is a sequence of Report trans­ actions initiated by the publisher as defined by parameters of the subscription. Each Report trans­ action in a subscription reports changes to the subscription data.
>
> To keep the subscription alive, a [Report transaction](#report-transaction) is sent from the publisher every maximum interval, or possibly more frequently.
>
> Report transactions from the publisher are rate limited by the minimum interval subscription para­ meter, as negotiated between the subscriber and publisher.
>
> The Subscribe Request action provides boundary values (floor or ceiling) for the publisher to deter­ mine the final minimum and maximum interval parameters of the subscription. The time units for these intervals are seconds.
>
> Each Subscribe interaction is a subscription that is identified by a Subscription ID as generated by the publisher.

- The Subscribe interaction SHALL start with one [Subscribe transaction](#subscribe-transaction) followed by a periodic sequence of Report transactions (see [Report Transaction](#report-transaction)).

- A Report transaction SHALL be initiated by a Report Data action as part of an active subscrip­ tion for a Subscribe interaction.

- All Report Data actions in a Subscribe interaction SHALL have the same SubscriptionId parame­ ter value that uniquely identifies the interaction among all subscriptions on the publisher.

- Each Report transaction in a subscription SHALL report the path for each delta change in the subscription data, including the attribute data that has changed and/or the event that has occurred, since the last Report transaction, with the exception of attribute data with the [Changes Omitted (C) quality](#changes-omitted-quality).

- Each [Report transaction](#report-transaction) initiated by the publisher SHALL complete successfully before another Report transaction is initiated by the publisher.

- Each Report transaction SHALL NOT be initiated by the publisher until the minimum interval has expired since the last Report transaction in the subscription.

- Attribute changes SHALL be delivered as soon as possible, taking into account the minimum interval.

- Events SHALL always be queued and buffered. Each Report containing events SHALL deliver queued events without reordering the queue. Queued events MAY be opportunistically deliv­ ered whenever some other activity triggers a Report transaction. Absent any such triggers, queued events SHALL be delivered in a Report transaction generated at the maximum interval.

- When the IsUrgent flag is FALSE or absent for a subscription’s event path in the [EventPathIB](#_bookmark912), event queueing does not automatically trigger a Report transaction.

- When the IsUrgent flag is TRUE for a subscription’s event path in the [EventPathIB](#_bookmark912), the queueing of such an event SHALL trigger a Report transaction for the subscription, subject to all Report

> transaction rules. This Report transaction will report the events that have been queued by the time the Report transaction happens.

- If the subscriber does not receive a [Report transaction](#report-transaction) within the maximum interval from the last Report Data, the subscriber SHALL terminate the Subscribe interaction.

- If a node receives a Report Data action with an inactive SubscriptionId, a Status Response action SHALL be sent with an INVALID_SUBSCRIPTION Status Code.

- If, in response to a Report Data action, the publisher receives a Status Response action with a status code that is not SUCCESS, the publisher SHALL terminate the Subscribe interaction.

- If the publisher does not receive a Status Response action in response to a Report Data action with SuppressResponse set to FALSE, the publisher MAY terminate the Subscribe interaction or SHALL re-synchronize the subscription in the next Report Data transaction by:

  - Including all subscription data to re-prime the subscription, or

  - Including all deltas since the last successful Report Data transaction.

- The subscriber MAY terminate the subscription and interaction by responding with a Status Response action with an INVALID_SUBSCRIPTION Status Code.

- The publisher MAY terminate the subscription and interaction by not generating a [Report trans­](#report-transaction) [action](#report-transaction) within the maximum interval.

- When a Subscribe interaction is terminated on the publisher or subscriber, the subscription, identified by a SubscriptionId, SHALL also be terminated.

### Subscribe Transaction

| **Action** | **Action Flow** | **Description** |
|----|----|----|
| **Subscribe Request** | Initiator ⇒ Target | list of event and attribute data identifiers supported on a server cluster |
| **Report Data** | Initiator ⇐ Target | primed published data |
| **Status Response** | Initiator ⇒ Target | success, or otherwise an error to terminate the subscription |
| **Subscribe Response** | Initiator ⇐ Target | provides subscription parame­ ters |

### Subscribe Request Action

> Subscribe Request action is a first action. Please see [Common Action Behavior](#common-action-behavior) for behavior com­ mon to all actions. The specific action information for this action is shown below.

#### Subscribe Request Action Information

| **Action Field** | **Type** | **Conformance** | **Description** |
|----|----|----|----|
| **KeepSubscriptions** | bool | M | false to terminate exist­ ing subscriptions from initiator |
| **MinIntervalFloor** | uint16 | M | the requested mini­ mum interval bound­ ary floor in seconds |
| **MaxIntervalCeiling** | uint16 | M | the requested maxi­ mum interval bound­ ary ceiling in seconds |
| **AttributeRequests** | list\[[AttributePathIB](#attributepathib)\] | O | a list of zero or more request paths to cluster attribute data |
| **DataVersionFilters** | list\[[DataVersionFil­](#dataversionfilterib) [terIB](#dataversionfilterib)\] | AttributeRequests | a list of zero or more cluster instance data versions |
| **EventRequests** | list\[[EventPathIB](#_bookmark912)\] | O | a list of zero or more request paths to cluster events |
| **EventFilters** | list\[[EventFilterIB](#_bookmark911)\] | EventRequests | a list of zero or more minimum event num­ bers per specific node |
| **FabricFiltered** | bool | M | limits the data read within fabric-scoped lists to the [accessing](#accessing-fabric) [fabric](#accessing-fabric) |

1.  **Outgoing Subscribe Request Action**

- This action SHALL initiate a Subscribe interaction.

- A Subscribe Request action SHALL be unicast from the subscriber to the publisher.

- This action SHALL be generated to initiate a Subscribe interaction (see [Subscribe Interaction](#subscribe-interaction)).

- This action SHALL include a requested ceiling (highest) maximum interval value as MaxInter­ valCeiling.

- This action SHALL include a requested floor (lowest) minimum interval value as MinInter­ valFloor.

#### NOTE

> If the publisher is an [intermittently connected device](#intermittently-connected-device-icd), the MinIntervalFloor SHOULD be 0. To avoid needing to switch to Active Mode to process the event and a second time to send the information, an [ICD](#intermittently-connected-device-icd) MAY try to synchronize its updates towards various subscribers so that it only needs to go to Active Mode once and can stay idle for a full idle interval. If the MinIntervalFloor is too high, this limits the freedom for an ICD to synchronize its updates. The higher the MinIntervalFloor is,
>
> the higher the likelihood an ICD will not be able to send updates to various sub­ scribers in a synchronized pattern, which might negatively impact energy usage (e.g. battery life).

- At least one attribute or event SHALL be indicated in the action.

- A valid [AttributePathIB](#attributepathib) SHALL be one in the table [Valid Read Attribute Paths](#valid-read-attribute-paths).

- A valid [EventPathIB](#_bookmark912) SHALL be one in the table [Valid Event Paths](#_bookmark913).

- A path indicated in AttributeRequests or EventRequests SHALL NOT target a group.

#### Incoming Subscribe Request Action

- If KeepSubscriptions is FALSE, all existing or pending subscriptions on the publisher for this subscriber SHALL be terminated.

- This layer SHALL process the Subscribe Request action as defined in [Incoming Read Request](#_bookmark877) [and Subscribe Request Action Processing](#_bookmark877).

### Subscribe Response Action

> Subscribe Response action is the last following action in a [Subscribe Transaction](#subscribe-transaction). This action acti­ vates the subscription. Please see [Common Action Behavior](#common-action-behavior) for behavior common to all actions. The specific action information for this action is shown below (see [Subscribe Interaction](#subscribe-interaction)).

#### Subscribe Response Action Information

| **Action Field** | **Type** | **Conformance** | **Description** |
|----|----|----|----|
| **SubscriptionId** | uint32 | M | identifies the subscrip­ tion |
| **MaxInterval** | uint16 | M | the final maximum interval for the sub­ scription in seconds |

1.  **Outgoing Subscribe Response Action**

    - Upon receipt of a successful Status Response action from the subscriber for the Report Data action that primes the subscription, this action SHALL be generated and submitted to the mes­ sage layer to send to the subscriber.

    - This action SHALL be unicast.

    - The SubscriptionId value SHALL be the same as the one used in Report Data generated to prime this subscription.

    - The publisher SHALL compute an appropriate value for the MaxInterval field in the action. This SHALL respect the following constraint: MinIntervalFloor ≤ MaxInterval ≤ MAX([SUBSCRIPTION\_­](#subscribe-interaction-limits) [MAX_INTERVAL_PUBLISHER_LIMIT](#subscribe-interaction-limits), MaxIntervalCeiling)

    - Upon sending a Subscribe Response action, the subscription, as indicated by the SubscriptionId, SHALL become active on the publisher with a min interval equal to the requested MinInter­ valFloor and a max interval equal to the MaxInterval field in the response.

#### Subscription Activation

- The paths to the subscription data SHALL only be error free existent paths generated from pro­ cessing the Subscribe Request.

> The EventFilters and DataVersionFilters fields in the Subscribe Request are one time parameters for the priming of the subscription.

- Subsequent ReportData actions, as part of the subscription, SHALL include the latest:

&nbsp;

- EventNo associated with each node generating new events.

- DataVersion associated with each cluster where there are data changes.

&nbsp;

- The FabricFiltered parameter from the Subscribe Request SHALL remain in effect for all data reported during the interaction.

- Upon subscription activation, the minimum and maximum interval parameters SHALL take effect to determine the timing and expectation of subsequent Report transactions.

## Report Transaction

> There is no Report interaction. A Report transaction is part of a Subscribe interaction. Please see [Subscribe Interaction](#subscribe-interaction) for details.
>

    - Else if the command in the path is fabric-scoped and there is no accessing fabric, a [Com­](#commandstatusib) [mandStatusIB](#commandstatusib) SHALL be generated with the UNSUPPORTED_ACCESS Status Code.

    - Else if the command in the path requires a Timed Invoke transaction to invoke and this action is not part of a Timed Invoke transaction, a [CommandStatusIB](#commandstatusib) SHALL be gener­ ated with the NEEDS_TIMED_INTERACTION Status Code.

    - Each generated [CommandStatusIB](#commandstatusib) CommandPath field SHALL be a duplicate of the con­ crete path processed, including the command ID of the original concrete path.

  - Else perform [Request Path Expansion](#request-path-expansion) and process each expanded existent path as follows:

    - If invoking the command in the path requires a privilege that is not granted for the clus­ ter in the path, or is restricted (see [ManagedDevice](#manageddevice-feature)), then the path SHALL be discarded.

    - Else if the command in the path is fabric-scoped and there is no accessing fabric, then the path SHALL be discarded.

    - Else if the command in the path requires a Timed Invoke transaction to invoke and this action is not part of a Timed Invoke transaction, then the path SHALL be discarded.

&nbsp;

- Each command in the remaining and error-free concrete command paths SHALL be executed, as defined in [Invoke Execution](#_bookmark895).

> **Invoke Execution**

- The command SHALL be executed as defined in the cluster specification, and the following applies:

  - For each data field in CommandFields:

    - If a mandatory data field is missing, or incoming data cannot be mapped to the expected data type for a field, a [CommandStatusIB](#commandstatusib) SHALL be generated with an error status of INVALID_COMMAND, even if the cluster defines another type of response.

    - If a data field violates expected constraints, a [CommandStatusIB](#commandstatusib) SHOULD be generated with an error status of CONSTRAINT_ERROR.

  - If the cluster specification defines a following command in response to the command, a [CommandDataIB](#commanddataib) SHALL be generated for the following command with these fields:

    - CommandFields defined for the following command

    - ClusterPath field of the CommandPath field that is a duplicate of the command path processed, up to the cluster ID

    - Command field of the CommandPath field that is the command ID of the following com­ mand

  - Else if the cluster specification defines a success or error status as a response (sometimes specified as a Default Response), a [CommandStatusIB](#commandstatusib) SHALL be generated with these fields:

    - CommandPath that is a duplicate of the concrete command path processed

    - Status as defined in the cluster specification

- If the InvokeRequest contains more than 1 [CommandDataIB](#commanddataib):

  - If the InvokeRequest contains certain commands and endpoints for which the server has an efficient way to process those commands:

    - The server MAY do so, even if this would deviate from the general concept of "execution started in order" for the commands which are grouped.

  - Else:

    - The Invoke Execution SHALL be started for each command in the same order as con­ veyed and expanded.

  - Actions MAY run concurrently, and the protocol offers no guarantees about completion of one action preceding the start of another.

  - In case one or more of these [CommandDataIB](#commanddataib) triggers an asynchronous action, any given [Invoke Execution](#_bookmark895) may not complete in the same order as the corresponding [Command­](#commanddataib) [DataIB](#commanddataib) in the request. As a consequence, the order of generated [CommandDataIB](#commanddataib) and/or [CommandStatusIB](#commandstatusib) MAY be different from the order of the corresponding [CommandDataIB](#commanddataib) in the InvokeRequest.

- An [Invoke Response Generation](#_bookmark897) SHALL be performed on completion of all valid commands. A partial [Invoke Response Generation](#_bookmark897) MAY be performed at any time when processing multiple

> commands, provided it carries at least a single response.

### Invoke Response Action

> Invoke Response action is a following action for an Invoke Request action. Please see [Common](#common-action-behavior) [Action Behavior](#common-action-behavior) for behavior common to all actions. The specific action information for this action is shown below.

#### Invoke Response Action Information

| **Action Field** | **Type** | **Conformance** | **Description** |
|----|----|----|----|
| **SuppressResponse** | bool | M | Ignored by client |
| **InvokeResponses** | list\[[InvokeResponseIB](#invokeresponseib)\] | M | command response or status |

> The SuppressResponse field is mandatory to maintain backwards compatibility with older clients. However, as Matter does not support responses to InvokeResponse actions, this field has no effect.

#### Outgoing Invoke Response Action

- This action SHALL be generated in response to an Invoke Request action, after all valid com­ mands are executed.

- A valid [InvokeResponseIB](#invokeresponseib) SHALL only indicate a concrete path.

> **Invoke Response Generation**

- If the previous action in this transaction action is groupcast, this process and transaction termi­ nate with no response.

- Else if SuppressResponse is FALSE, or a [CommandDataIB](#commanddataib) was generated, an Invoke Response action SHALL be generated as follows:

  - Each generated [CommandStatusIB](#commandstatusib) and [CommandDataIB](#commanddataib) SHALL be included in an [InvokeRe­](#invokeresponseib) [sponseIB](#invokeresponseib) in the InvokeResponses action field.

  - An Invoke Response action SHALL be submitted to the message layer to send to the source of the previous action.

#### Incoming Invoke Response Action

- Upon receipt of this action, each entry in InvokeResponses SHALL be processed, in order, as fol­ lows:

  - If the entry is a [CommandStatusIB](#commandstatusib), it SHALL be submitted to the layer above.

  - Else if the response is a [CommandDataIB](#commanddataib):

    - If the ClusterPath field of the CommandPath field does not duplicate or match a wildcard of one of the paths in the previous action of the interaction, the entry SHALL be dis­ carded.

    - Else if the command ID value of the Command field of the CommandPath field is not

> expected by the cluster instance, the entry SHALL be discarded.

- Else it SHALL be submitted to the layer above.

&nbsp;

- For each entry in the initial Invoke Request action that triggered this incoming Invoke Response action, if there isn’t a corresponding entry in InvokeResponses, a [CommandStatusIB](#commandstatusib) with the NO_COMMAND_RESPONSE status SHALL be submitted to the layer above.

## Common Action Information Blocks and Paths

> Shown below are common information blocks used to submit actions to, and receive actions from, the message layer.

### Path Information

- Logically for this specification, the Node or Group SHALL be present in all paths.

- When an outgoing path indicates the same Node or Group as the action target, the message layer MAY optimize the path by removing Node or Group.

- When an incoming path does not indicate a Node or Group, the message layer SHALL add the action target (Node or Group) to the path.

### Scope and Purpose

> This is part of a package of Data Model specifications that are agnostic to underlying layers (encod­ ing, message, network, transport, etc.). Each specification below may be independently maintained. This package, as a whole, SHALL be independently maintained as agnostic and decoupled from lower layers. This package may be referenced by inclusion in a set of protocol stack specifications for a complete vertical standard.

> **[Data Model](#chapter-7.-data-model-specification)** Defines first order elements and namespace for endpoints, clusters, attributes, data types, etc.
>
> **[Interaction Model](#chapter-8.-interaction-model-specification)** Defines interactions, transactions and actions between nodes.
>
> **[System Model](#chapter-9.-system-model-specification)** Defines relationships that are managed between endpoints and clusters.
>
> **Cluster Library** Reference library of cluster specifications.
>
> **Device Library** Reference library of devices type definitions.

### Origin Story

> The origin of this section is the [Dotdot Architecture Model](#_bookmark90) and parts of Chapter 2 of the [Zigbee Clus­](#_bookmark91) [ter Library specification](#_bookmark91) that define the data model.
>
> The purpose is that this document will align with current cluster specifications in the ZCL and still support cluster updates and evolution into a single set of data models.

### Overview

> This specification defines persistent relationships between local and remote instances of data model elements, that support a system of operational communication between such instances. A system is a set of nodes and persistent relationships that automate data flow and control based on local or external stimulus.

## Endpoint Composition

- Endpoint composition SHALL be indicated by these [Descriptor](#descriptor-cluster) cluster attributes:

  - DeviceTypeList SHALL list the device type(s) that the endpoint supports.

  - PartsList SHALL indicate endpoints as required for each device type in the DeviceTypeList.

    - The population of the PartsList of the various endpoints allows for the indication of a hierarchy (composition) for which the following terms are defined:

      - "Descendants" of an endpoint E are endpoints that are:

        - in the PartsList of E, or

        - descendants of an endpoint in the PartsList of E.

      - "Children" of an endpoint E are endpoints that are descendants of E but not descendants of any endpoint in the PartsList of E.

      - "Sibling endpoints" are endpoints which are children of the same endpoint.

[TABLE]

- Each [simple endpoint](#simple-device-type) SHALL support exactly one [Application device type](#application-device-type) with these exceptions:

  - The endpoint MAY support additional device types which are subsets of the [Application](#application-device-type) [device](#application-device-type) type (the superset). See [Superset Device Types](#superset-device-types) for cluster requirements of superset devices.

  - The endpoint MAY support additional device types ([application](#application-device-type), [utility](#utility-device-type) or [node](#device-type-scope) device types) as defined by each additional device type.

[TABLE]

[TABLE]

- A leaf device type is not composed of other application device types (see above bullet on sub­ sets).

[TABLE]

- Most device types define leaf endpoints without the need for composition.

[TABLE]

- There can be situations where leaf endpoints have no application device types, and one or more utility device types.

[TABLE]

- A composed device type is composed of one or more other device types, which have their own endpoints which are listed in the PartsList of the endpoint of the composed device type.

[TABLE]

- Endpoint composition SHALL be defined in the device type specification.

### Endpoint Composition Patterns

> This specification defines two patterns for endpoint composition supported by a device type:

- Tree pattern of endpoints directly below the composed endpoint.

- Full-family list of all descendant endpoints below the composed endpoint.

#### Tree Pattern

> The tree pattern supports a general tree of endpoints, each of which supports the pattern defined by the endpoint’s device type. The tree pattern is commonly used for composed application device types. The tree pattern is commonly used for device types that support physical device composition (e.g. a Refrigerator).

- The tree pattern of composition SHALL be defined in the device type specification, by a table of device types, from which the specified device type is composed.

  - Each device type from the table that is included in an implementation SHALL be repre­ sented by one or more endpoints in the PartsList attribute of the Descriptor cluster on the endpoint of the parent device type.

  - An implementation MAY include other device types not listed in the table of device types in its composition and each such additional device SHALL be represented by an endpoint in the PartsList attribute of the Descriptor cluster on the endpoint of the parent device type.

[TABLE]

#### Full-Family Pattern

> The full-family pattern is a list of all descendant endpoints, with no imposed hierarchy.

- The full-family pattern of endpoint composition SHALL be defined in the device type specifica­ tion by stating that the device type supports the full-family pattern.

- The PartsList attribute of the Descriptor cluster on the endpoint SHALL contain all descendant endpoints.

[TABLE]

#### No Cycles

- An endpoint SHALL NOT include itself in its PartsList attribute.

- Cycles where an endpoint is a (direct or indirect) ancestor of itself SHALL NOT occur.

### Root Node Endpoint

> A root node device type is a category of device type that is specified to be supported by all nodes in a fabric. Its main function is to describe the node and what endpoints the node supports.

- A root node device type SHALL be a singleton on the root node endpoint.

- The PartsList of the Descriptor cluster on the root node endpoint SHALL list all endpoints on the

> node, except the root node endpoint.

- The root node endpoint SHALL NOT exist in any other endpoint’s PartsList on the node.

- The root node endpoint requirements are defined by a node scoped device type.

- There SHALL be only one root node endpoint for the node.

#### NOTE

> The root node endpoint is currently under-specified for nodes which are not com­ missionable. As a result, the root node endpoint on non-commissionable nodes MAY be absent or otherwise limited in functionality. This specification gap is expected to be addressed in a future revision.

### Disambiguation

> Using the terms and composition patterns described above, some endpoints will have sibling end­ points with an overlap in application device type(s). For this case, the **Duplicate** condition has been defined (see the Base Device Type in the Device Library).

- A device type definition MAY define a method for disambiguation when the Duplicate condition applies to either the endpoint with that device type or to its children.

- If no disambiguation method is defined in the relevant device type definitions, an endpoint to which the Duplicate condition applies SHALL have a TagList attribute in its Descriptor cluster and its set of tags SHALL be distinct from the set of tags of any sibling endpoint with which it has an overlap in application device type(s). When comparing sets of tags, ordering of the list SHALL be ignored.

- The TagList feature and attribute MAY also be used in other cases to provide guidance to a client and/or a user.

- When the Duplicate condition applies, clients SHOULD disambiguate the relevant sibling end­ points in their user interfaces and client logic using the method defined in the device type or the TagList attribute values if no other method is defined.

[TABLE]

[TABLE]

[TABLE]

> ![](media/image47.png)Note that these requirements related to disambiguation hold for non-composed as well as com­ posed device types, as illustrated in the examples below.

[TABLE]

[TABLE]

[TABLE]

### ![](media/image48.png)Dynamic Endpoint Allocation

> Some nodes MAY require a dynamic number of endpoints, since the functionality they expose can change at run-time, e.g.

- a [Bridge](#changes-to-the-set-of-bridged-devices) on which Bridged Devices are added or deleted.

- a Casting Video Player in which Content App endpoints are added or deleted (see Device Library, section 10).

> Such dynamic entities which need to be exposed with an endpoint, will be referred to as an "exposed entity" in the following description.
>
> For any node which changes its endpoint composition, the endpoint addresses SHALL be allocated according to the following rules:

- When such exposed entity is exposed for the first time, it SHALL be allocated a *new* endpoint address (or set of endpoint addresses), incrementing from the highest previously (ever) used endpoint address.

  - For the situation where a node following these mechanisms has exhausted all available remaining endpoint addresses for exposed entities, it MAY wrap around to the lowest unused endpoint address, starting at 1, since the RootNode endpoint (endpoint 0) cannot be used to host application device types and is therefore never free.

- For existing exposed entities, the endpoint addresses SHALL NOT be changed.

  - This persistency requirement also holds for the case of restart/reboot of the device.

> As a result of these mechanisms, endpoint addresses that were used for exposed entities that were once exposed but now have been removed will *not* be reused in the future (apart from the excep­ tional wrap-around corner case mentioned above), in order to avoid the possibility of confusing other nodes by re-assigning (reusing) an endpoint address for a *different* exposed entity. Other nodes using the exposed entities from this node SHOULD remove information related to exposed entities no longer being exposed.
>
> Other nodes that wish to be notified of changes of the exposed entities SHOULD monitor changes of the PartsList attribute in the Descriptor cluster on the [root node endpoint](#root-node-endpoint).

### Superset Device Types

> A superset device type is a device type that is functionally similar to a subset device type and has an overlap in its cluster requirements with a subset device type. If an endpoint lists both the superset device type and the subset device type(s) in its DeviceTypeList list, a client that is capable of only controlling the subset device type(s) would also be able to control the aspects of the superset device type that are in common with the subset device type.
>
> A superset device type is subject to the following constraints:

- All clusters in the subset device type with mandatory conformance SHALL be supported in the superset device type with mandatory conformance.

- Any clusters in the subset device type with optional conformance MAY be supported in the superset device type.

- Any clusters in the subset device type with optional conformance that are also supported in the superset device type MAY have either optional or mandatory conformance in the superset device type.

- Element requirements of overlapping clusters in the superset device type SHALL be the same as in the subset device type.

- An endpoint implementing a superset device type MAY include the subset device type(s) in the DeviceTypeList of the descriptor cluster of the endpoint.

> A composed device type SHALL indicate that superset device types are allowed in an implementa­
>
> tion by adding a + sign after the ID and the name of the subset device type having a subset/superset relationship in the device type requirements table of the composed device type.
>
> An endpoint SHALL NOT implement a subset of a device type listed in the device type requirements table of a composed device type.
>
> For example, the following table indicates that an implementation may use a dimmable light or any superset of a dimmable light (such as color temperature light and extended color light) in a com­ posed device, but it may not use an on/off light as that is a subset of a dimmable light:

| **ID**  | **Name**        | **Constraint** | **Conformance** |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| 0x0101+ | Dimmable Light+ |                | O               |

## Interaction Model Relationships

> This section define some of the system behaviors and their constraints as they apply to interactions specified in the [Interaction Model](#chapter-8.-interaction-model-specification).

### Subscription

#### Persistency

> A subscription is an ephemeral 'session' between a subscriber and a publisher. A subscription can lose synchronization for a variety of reasons, including (but not limited to):

- Inability to send reports due to network connectivity issues

- Factory-reset of the publisher

- Reboot of either the subscriber or publisher

- Decision by either publisher or subscriber to tear down the subscription to reclaim resources

> In all cases, the subscriber can eventually discover the loss of synchronization by not receiving a sync report or data report in the agreed upon sync interval, or through some other failure to com­ municate with the publisher.

- When a subscriber discovers the loss of synchronization, it MAY then initiate a re-subscription to resume the subscription.

- An implementation MAY choose to persist the details of a subscription across reboots, but it is not necessary.

> In all cases, the publisher eventually discovers the loss of synchronization by not receiving a Status Response to a Report Data message that expects a response, or by receiving an error Status Response.

## Binding Relationship

> This relationship occurs because a simple client endpoint does not know which endpoints will be the target for the client generated actions, on one or more remote nodes.

[TABLE]

> In such cases, a binding is used to direct the local endpoint to the remote endpoint. The existence of the Binding cluster on an endpoint, allows a director to create one or more binding entries (bind­ ings) in the Binding cluster. A director is a remote client that is given access to create such bindings.
>
> Each binding indicates either a remote node’s endpoint or cluster on a remote node’s endpoint. Multiple bindings are allowed, depending on the interaction. A binding is either a unicast binding, where the binding target is a remote endpoint, or a groupcast binding, where the binding target is a group of remote endpoints.
>
> Please see the Binding Cluster specification for more specification detail.

## Descriptor Cluster

> **NOTE** The Descriptor cluster is meant to replace the support from the Zigbee Device Object (ZDO) for describing a node, its endpoints and clusters.
>
> This cluster describes an endpoint instance on the node, independently from other endpoints, but also allows composition of endpoints to conform to complex device type patterns.
>
> This cluster supports a list of one or more device type identifiers that represent conformance to device type specifications.

[TABLE]

> The cluster supports a PartsList attribute that is a list of zero or more endpoints to support a com­ posed device type.

>
> It MAY also be used to provide information about an endpoint (e.g. the relative location of a Tem­ perature sensor in a Temperature Controlled Cabinet).

- A client SHOULD use these tags to convey disambiguation information and other relevant infor­ mation to the user (e.g. showing it in a user interface), as appropriate.

- A client SHOULD use these tags in its logic to make decisions, as appropriate.

> For example, a client MAY identify which endpoint maps to a certain function, orientation or label­ ing.
>
> A client MAY use the Label field of each [SemanticTagStruct](#semantictagstruct-type), if present in each structure, to indicate characteristics of an endpoint, or to augment what is provided in the TagID field of the same struc­ ture.

## Binding Cluster

#### NOTE

> This scope of this document is the Binding cluster as part of the Cluster Library. The Binding cluster is meant to replace the support from the Zigbee Device Object (ZDO) for supporting the binding table.
>
> A binding represents a persistent relationship between an endpoint and one or more other local or remote endpoints. A binding does not require that the relationship exists. It is up to the node appli­ cation to set up the relationship.
>
> A binding is used to inform a client endpoint of one or more targets for a potential interaction. For example: a light switch that controls one or more light bulbs, needs to be told the nodes and end­ points of the bulbs, or told a group in which the bulbs are members. For example: A client that needs to subscribe to an occupancy sensor, needs to know the node and endpoint of the sensor.
>
> In such cases, a binding is used to direct a local endpoint to a target. The existence of the Binding cluster on the client endpoint, allows the creation of one or more binding entries (bindings) in the Binding cluster.
>
> Each binding indicates another endpoint or cluster on another endpoint. Multiple bindings are allowed, depending on the interaction.
>
> A binding is either a unicast binding, where the target is a single endpoint on a single node, or a groupcast binding, where the target is a group, which may indicate multiple endpoints on multiple nodes. The binding may also target a single cluster on the target endpoint(s).
>
> When a client cluster requires a target for an interaction, the Binding cluster SHALL exist on the same endpoint.
>
> Once a binding entry is created on the Binding cluster, the client endpoint MAY initiate interactions to the binding target.

### Binding Mutation

> If, during the creation of multiple bindings, there are no available resources to create an entry, or to establish a binding relationship, the client SHALL respond with a status of RESOURCE_EX­ HAUSTED, and the binding SHALL NOT be created.
>
> The number of bindings supported is left to the implementation. However, a device type definition MAY prescribe the minimum number of bindings supported on an endpoint. In this case, the num­ ber prescribed by the device type SHALL be supported for each fabric the node supports, unless the device type specifies otherwise. The total number of bindings supported SHALL be the sum of the requirements for each endpoint, unless the device types involved specify otherwise.

- For example, if a node supports 6 fabrics and a device type specifies at least 3 bindings must be supported, the node would need to support at least 18 bindings and ensure that at least 3 were available to every fabric.

> A binding SHALL only be created with the Cluster field if the indicated client cluster exists on the endpoint.
>
> When a binding is removed, the client endpoint SHALL end the binding relationship with the removed binding target.

> The global ClusterRevision attribute value SHALL be the highest revision number in the table below.

#### 9.7.5.1. LabelList Attribute

> This is a list of string tuples. Each entry is a [LabelStruct](#labelstruct-type).

## Fixed Label Cluster

> This cluster is derived from the Label cluster and provides a feature for the device to tag an end­ point with zero or more read-only labels.
>
> Examples:

- A bridge can use this to indicate grouping of bridged devices. For example: All bridged devices whose endpoints have an entry in their LabelList "room":"bedroom 2" are in the same (bed)room.

- A manufacturer can use this to identify a characteristic of an endpoint. For example to identify the endpoints of a luminaire, one pointing up, the other pointing down, one of the endpoints would have a LabelList entry "orientation":"up" while the other would have "orienta­ tion":"down". Using such indication, the user interface of a Node controlling this luminaire

> knows which of the endpoints is which of the lights.
>
> Note that the [TagList](#taglist-attribute) in the Descriptor cluster provides an alternative mechanism for such self- description using standardized tags rather than manufacturer-selected strings, yielding a standard­ ized mechanism for features defined in the various [namespaces](#_bookmark14). The second example above can be implemented using semantic tags Direction.Upward and Direction.Downward instead of (or in addition to) the Fixed Label cluster.

#### Extension Feature

> This feature indicates the device supports ACL Extension attribute.

#### ManagedDevice Feature

> This feature is for a device that is managed by a service associated with the device vendor and which imposes default access restrictions upon each new fabric added to it. This could arise, for example, if the device is managed by a service provider under contract to an end-user, in such a way that the manager of the device does not unconditionally grant universal access to all of a device’s functionality, even for fabric administrators. For example, many Home Routers are man­ aged by an Internet Service Provider (a service), and these services often have a policy that requires them to obtain user consent before certain administrative functions can be delegated to a third party (e.g., a fabric Administrator). These restrictions are expressed using an Access Restriction List (ARL).
>
> The purpose of this feature on the Access Control cluster is to indicate to a fabric Administrator that access by it to specific attributes, commands and/or events for specific clusters is currently prohib­ ited. Attempts to access these restricted data model elements SHALL result in an error of ACCESS_RESTRICTED.
>
> A device that implements this feature SHALL have a mechanism to honor the ReviewFabricRestric­ tions command, such as user interfaces or service interactions associated with a service provider or the device manufacturer, which allows the owner (or subscriber) to manage access restrictions for each fabric. The user interface design, which includes the way restrictions are organized and pre­ sented to the user, is not specified, but SHOULD be usable by non-expert end-users from common mobile devices, personal computers, or an on-device user interface.
>
> Controllers and clients SHOULD incorporate generic handling of the ACCESS_RESTRICTED error code, when it appears in allowed contexts, in order to gracefully handle situations where this fea­ ture is encountered. Device vendors that adopt this feature SHOULD be judicious in its use given the risk of unexpected behavior in controllers and clients.
>
> For certification testing, a device that implements this feature SHALL provide a way for all restric­ tions to be removed.
>
> The ARL attribute provides the set of restrictions currently applied to this fabric.
>
> The ReviewFabricRestrictions command provides a way for the fabric Administrator to request that the server triggers a review of the current fabric restrictions, by involving external entities such as end-users, or other services associated with the manager of the device hosting the server. This review process MAY involve communication between external services and the user, and MAY take an unpredictable amount of time to complete since an end-user may need to visit some resources, such as a mobile application or web site. A FabricRestrictionReviewUpdate event will be generated by the device within a predictable time period of the ReviewFabricRestrictionsResponse (see [ReviewFabricRestrictions](#reviewfabricrestrictions-command) for specification of this time period), and this event can be correlated with the ReviewFabricRestrictionsResponse using a token provided in both. The device MAY pro­ vide instructions or a Redirect URL in the FabricRestrictionReviewUpdate event in order to help the user access the features required for managing per-fabric restrictions.
>
> See [Section 6.6.2, “Model”](#model) for a description of how access control is impacted by the ARL attribute.
>
> **Managed Device Feature Usage Restrictions**
>
> Use of this feature SHALL be limited to the mandatory clusters of endpoints having a device type that explicitly permits its use in the Device Library Specification. As a reminder, the device types associated with an endpoint are listed in the Descriptor cluster of the endpoint.
>
> In addition, use of this feature SHALL NOT restrict the following clusters on any endpoint:

1.  the Descriptor Cluster (0x001D)

2.  the Binding Cluster (0x001E)

3.  the Network Commissioning Cluster (0x0031)

4.  the Identify Cluster (0x0003)

5.  the Groups Cluster (0x0004)

> In addition, use of this feature SHALL NOT restrict the [global attributes](#global-elements) of any cluster.
>
> Because ARLs cannot be used to restrict root node access or access to any clusters required for com­ missioning, administrators MAY determine the current restrictions of the ARL at any point, includ­ ing during commissioning after joining the fabric.

#### Default Value

> The default values of the Access Control Cluster ACL and Extension attributes are empty; that is, devoid of contents, with each list attribute containing zero elements.

> The Access Control List is able to have an initial entry added because the [Access Control Privilege](#conceptual-access-control-privilege-granting-algorithm) [Granting algorithm](#conceptual-access-control-privilege-granting-algorithm) behaves as if, over a PASE commissioning channel during the [commissioning](#commissioning-flows) [phase](#commissioning-flows), the following implicit Access Control Entry were present on the Commissionee (but not on the Commissioner):

[TABLE]

> When the [ManagedDevice](#manageddevice-feature) feature is present, the value of the Access Control Cluster Commis­ sioningARL attribute contains the set of access restrictions applied during commissioning, before a fabric has been assigned. Upon allocation of a new FabricIndex during commissioning (see [Node](#node-operational-credentials-cluster) [Operational Credentials Cluster](#node-operational-credentials-cluster) [AddNOC](#addnoc-command) command), one or more ARL entries with the new FabricIndex SHALL be added to the ARL attribute.
>
> In the following example of the CommissioningARL and ARL attributes, the restrictions applied during commissioning consist of a single entry with 3 limitations on Cluster 0x0453 of Endpoint 1: writing to attribute 0x0000, all commands, all events. In contrast, the example also includes a restriction on the fabric with index 1 which consists of 1 limitation on Cluster 0x0453 of Endpoint 1: writing to attribute 0x0000.

#### Administration Guidelines

> The Access Control Cluster is passive in nature and is only responsible for maintaining entries in the Access Control List. It is the responsibility of Administrators to create and maintain Access Con­ trol policy by managing the list and its entries. The Access Control Cluster SHALL NOT change or remove Access Control Entries of its own volition. A device that needs to impose access restrictions upon a fabric MAY do so by adding Access Restriction Entries to the CommissioningARL and ARL attributes.
>
> Administrators SHOULD strive to minimize resource usage by combining entries where appropri­ ate. For example, if an Administrator is responsible for an entry that grants privilege to subject Node A, and wishes to grant the same privilege to Node B under the same conditions, then that
>
> Administrator SHOULD update the existing entry to apply to subject Node B as well as Node A, instead of creating a new entry. If a set of Nodes is commonly used in entries, then an Administra­ tor MAY consider using [CASE Authenticated Tags](#_bookmark647) (CATs) for those entries, especially if membership in the set of Nodes changes over time.
>
> Administrators SHOULD carefully consider the effect of Access Control Entries they manage, partic­ ularly when targeting entire Endpoints (either directly, or indirectly by Device Type), to ensure that granted privileges are appropriate for the set of Clusters that may entail. Administrators SHOULD be mindful that targeting by Device Type grants privileges to all Clusters on all Endpoints with Descriptor containing that Device Type (thereby including Clusters not part of that specified Device Type), now and in the future. Administrators SHOULD consider whether targeting specific End­ points, or Clusters, or both, might be a more appropriate policy for the given Subjects; studying the Descriptor Cluster for affected Endpoints may help in this determination.
>
> Administrators SHOULD be careful to avoid inadvertently removing their own administrative access. For example, an Administrator SHOULD change its own administrative access entry by updating the existing entry or by creating a new entry before removing the old entry, and SHOULD NOT remove the old entry before creating any new entry.

#### ACL Attribute

> An attempt to add an Access Control Entry when no more entries are available SHALL result in a RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED error being reported and the ACL attribute SHALL NOT have the entry added to it. See [access control limits](#access-control-limits).
>
> See the [AccessControlEntriesPerFabric](#accesscontrolentriesperfabric-attribute) attribute for the actual value of the number of entries per fabric supported by the server.
>
> Each Access Control Entry codifies a single grant of privilege on this Node, and is used by the [Access](#conceptual-access-control-privilege-granting-algorithm) [Control Privilege Granting algorithm](#conceptual-access-control-privilege-granting-algorithm) to determine if a subject has privilege to interact with targets on the Node.

#### Extension Attribute

> If present, the Access Control Extensions MAY be used by Administrators to store arbitrary [data](#_bookmark997) related to fabric’s Access Control Entries.
>
> The Access Control Extension list SHALL support a single extension entry per supported fabric.

#### SubjectsPerAccessControlEntry Attribute

> This attribute SHALL provide the minimum number of [Subjects](#_bookmark993) per entry that are supported by this server.
>
> Since reducing this value over time may invalidate ACL entries already written, this value SHALL NOT decrease across time as software updates occur that could impact this value. If this is a con­ cern for a given implementation, it is recommended to only use the minimum value required and avoid reporting a higher value than the required minimum.

#### TargetsPerAccessControlEntry Attribute

> This attribute SHALL provide the minimum number of [Targets](#_bookmark995) per entry that are supported by this server.
>
> Since reducing this value over time may invalidate ACL entries already written, this value SHALL NOT decrease across time as software updates occur that could impact this value. If this is a con­ cern for a given implementation, it is recommended to only use the minimum value required and avoid reporting a higher value than the required minimum.

#### AccessControlEntriesPerFabric Attribute

> This attribute SHALL provide the minimum number of [ACL Entries](#acl-attribute) per fabric that are supported by this server.
>
> Since reducing this value over time may invalidate ACL entries already written, this value SHALL NOT decrease across time as software updates occur that could impact this value. If this is a con­ cern for a given implementation, it is recommended to only use the minimum value required and avoid reporting a higher value than the required minimum.

#### CommissioningARL Attribute

> This attribute SHALL provide the set of [CommissioningAccessRestrictionEntryStruct](#commissioningaccessrestrictionentrystruct-type) applied during commissioning on a managed device.
>
> When present, the CommissioningARL attribute SHALL indicate the access restrictions applying during commissioning.
>
> Attempts to access data model elements described by an entry in the CommissioningARL attribute during commissioning SHALL result in an error of ACCESS_RESTRICTED. See [Access Control Model](#model) for more information about the features related to controlling access to a Node’s Endpoint Clusters ("Targets" hereafter) from other Nodes.
>
> See [Section 9.10.4.2.1, “Managed Device Feature Usage Restrictions”](#_bookmark984) for limitations on the use of access restrictions.

#### ARL Attribute

> This attribute SHALL provide the set of [AccessRestrictionEntryStruct](#accessrestrictionentrystruct-type) applied to the associated fab­ ric on a managed device.
>
> When present, the ARL attribute SHALL indicate the access restrictions applying to the accessing fabric. In contrast, the [CommissioningARL](#commissioningarl-attribute) attribute indicates the accessing restrictions that apply when there is no accessing fabric, such as during commissioning.
>
> The access restrictions are externally added/removed based on the particular relationship the device hosting this server has with external entities such as its owner, external service provider, or end-user.
>
> Attempts to access data model elements described by an entry in the ARL attribute for the accessing fabric SHALL result in an error of ACCESS_RESTRICTED. See [Access Control Model](#model) for more infor­
>
> mation about the features related to controlling access to a Node’s Endpoint Clusters ("Targets" hereafter) from other Nodes.
>
> See [Section 9.10.4.2.1, “Managed Device Feature Usage Restrictions”](#_bookmark984) for limitations on the use of access restrictions.

### Error handling

> Administrators SHALL use regular actions to administer the Access Control Cluster (by reading and writing entries in the list). Administrators SHOULD take care to use DataVersion conditional writes when administering the list or its contents.
>
> The Access Control Cluster SHALL fail to write, and return an appropriate error, if an attempt is made to create or update an Access Control Entry or Access Control Extension such that it would have invalid contents.
>
> For example, the following Access Control Entry conditions will result in an error of CONSTRAIN­ T_ERROR:

- Privilege enum value invalid

- AuthMode enum value invalid

- AuthMode is PASE (reserved for future use)

- Subjects element invalid

  - e.g. illegal CAT with CASE AuthMode

- Targets element invalid

  - e.g. no field present

  - e.g. both Endpoint and DeviceType fields present

- Field combinations invalid

  - e.g. Administer Privilege with Group AuthMode

> For example, the following Access Control Extension conditions will result in an error of CON­ STRAINT_ERROR:

- There is an attempt to add more than 1 entry associated with the given [accessing fabric index](#_bookmark691) in the extension list

- Data value exceeds max length

- Data value not valid [TLV-encoded](#appendix-a-tag-length-value-tlv-encoding-format) data

> The Access Control Cluster MAY fail to write, and return a RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED error, if an attempt is made to create or update an entry or extension such that storage is exhausted.

#### FabricRestrictionReviewUpdate Event

> The cluster SHALL generate a FabricRestrictionReviewUpdate event to indicate completion of a fab­ ric restriction review. Due to the requirement to generate this event within a bound time frame of successful receipt of the [ReviewFabricRestrictions](#reviewfabricrestrictions-command) command, this event MAY include additional steps that the client MAY present to the user in order to help the user locate the user interface for the Managed Device feature.

[TABLE]

> **Token Field**
>
> This field SHALL indicate the Token that can be used to correlate a ReviewFabricRestrictionsRe­ sponse with a FabricRestrictionReviewUpdate event.
>
> **Instruction Field**
>
> This field SHALL provide human readable text that MAY be displayed to the user to help them locate the user interface for managing access restrictions for each fabric.
>
> A device SHOULD implement the [Localization Configuration Cluster](#localization-configuration-cluster) when it has no other means to determine the locale to use for this text.
>
> Examples include "Please try again and immediately access device display for further instructions." or "Please check email associated with your Acme account."
>
> **ARLRequestFlowUrl Field**
>
> This field SHALL indicate the URL for the service associated with the device maker which the user can visit to manage fabric limitations. The syntax of this field SHALL follow the syntax as specified in [RFC 1738](#_bookmark43) and SHALL use the https scheme for internet-hosted URLs.

- The URL MAY embed the token, fabric index, fabric vendor, or other information transparently in order to pass context about the originating [ReviewFabricRestrictions](#reviewfabricrestrictions-command) command to the service associated with the URL. The service associated with the device vendor MAY perform vendor ID verification on the fabric from which the [ReviewFabricRestrictions](#reviewfabricrestrictions-command) command originated.

- If the device grants the request, the ARL attribute in the [Access Control Cluster](#access-control-cluster) SHALL be updated to reflect the new access rights and a successful response SHALL be returned to the device making the request using the MTaer field of the [callbackUrl](#_bookmark1012). If the request is denied, the ARL attribute SHALL remain unchanged and a failure response SHALL be returned to the device making the request using the MTaer field of the [callbackUrl](#_bookmark1012).

- The device using this mechanism SHALL provide a service at the URL that can accept requests for additional access and return responses indicating whether the requests were granted or denied.

- This URL will typically lead to a server which (e.g. by looking at the User-Agent) redirects the user to allow viewing, downloading, installing or using a manufacturer-provided means for guiding the user through the process to review and approve or deny the request. The device manufacturer MAY choose to use a constructed URL which is valid in a HTTP GET request (i.e. dedicated for the product) such as, for example, [https://domain.example/arl-app?vid=FFF1&](https://domain.example/arl-app?vid=FFF1&pid=1234) [pid=1234](https://domain.example/arl-app?vid=FFF1&pid=1234). If a client follows or launches the ARLRequestFlowUrl, it SHALL expand it as described in [Section 9.10.9.3.4, “ARLRequestFlowUrl format”](#_bookmark1011).

- A manufacturer contemplating using this flow should realize that

  - This flow typically requires internet access to access the URL, and access extension may fail when internet connectivity is not available.

  - If the flow prefers to redirect the user to an app which is available on popular platforms, it SHOULD also provide a fallback option such as a web browser interface to ensure users can complete access extension.

> **ARLRequestFlowUrl format**
>
> The ARLRequestFlowUrl SHALL contain a query component (see [RFC 3986](#_bookmark47) section 3.4) composed of one or more key-value pairs:

- The query SHALL use the & delimiter between key/value pairs.

- The key-value pairs SHALL in the format name=\<value\> where name is the key name, and \<value\>

> is the contents of the value encoded with proper URL-encoded escaping.

- If key MTcu is present, it SHALL have a value of "\_" (i.e. MTcu=\_). This is the "callback URL (Call­

> backUrl) placeholder".

- Any key whose name begins with MT not mentioned in the previous bullets SHALL be reserved for future use by this specification. Manufacturers SHALL NOT include query keys starting with MT in the ARLRequestFlowUrl unless they are referenced by a version of this specification.

> Any other element in the ARLRequestFlowUrl query field not covered by the above rules, as well as the fragment field (if present), SHALL remain including the order of query key/value pairs present.

#### Expansion of ARLRequestFlowUrl by client

> Once the URL is obtained, it SHALL be expanded to form a final URL (ExpandedARLRequestFlowUrl) by proceeding with the following substitution algorithm on the original ARLRequestFlowUrl:
>
> 1\. If key MTcu is present, compute the CallbackUrl desired (see [Section 9.10.9.3.5, “CallbackUrl for­](#_bookmark1012) [mat for ARL Request Flow response”](#_bookmark1012)), and substitute the placeholder value "\_" (i.e. in MTcu=\_) in the ARLRequestFlowUrl with the desired contents, encoded with proper URL-encoded escaping (see [RFC 3986](#_bookmark47) section 2).
>
> The final URL after expansion (ExpandedARLRequestFlowUrl) SHALL be the one to follow, rather than the original value obtained from the FabricRestrictionReviewUpdate event.
>
> **CallbackUrl format for ARL Request Flow response**
>
> If a CallbackUrl field (i.e. MTcu=) query field placeholder is present in the [ARLRequestFlowUrl](#_bookmark1011), the client MAY replace the placeholder value "\_" in the ExpandedARLRequestFlowUrl with a URL that the manufacturer flow can use to make a smooth return to the client when the ARL flow has termi­ nated.
>
> This URL field MAY contain a query component (see [RFC 3986](#_bookmark47) section 3.4). If a query is present, it SHALL be composed of one or more key-value pairs:

- The query SHALL use the & delimiter between key/value pairs.

- The key-value pairs SHALL follow the format name=\<value\> where name is the key name, and

> \<value\> is the contents of the value encoded with proper URL-encoded escaping.

- If key MTaer is present, it SHALL have a value of "\_" (i.e. MTaer=\_). This is the placeholder for a "access extension response" provided by the manufacturer flow to the client. The manufacturer flow SHALL replace this placeholder with the final status of the access extension request, which SHALL be formatted following [Expansion of CallbackUrl by the manufacturer custom flow](#expansion-of-callbackurl-by-the-manufacturer-custom-flow) and encoded with proper URL-encoded escaping.

- Any key whose name begins with MT not mentioned in the previous bullets SHALL be reserved for future use by this specification.

> Any other element in the CallbackUrl query field not covered by the above rules, as well as the frag­
>
> ment field (if present), SHALL remain as provided by the client through embedding within the
>
> ExpandedARLRequestFlowUrl, including the order of query key/value pairs present.

#### Expansion of CallbackUrl by the manufacturer custom flow

> Once the CallbackUrl is obtained by the manufacturer flow, it MAY be expanded to form a final ExpandedARLRequestCallbackUrl URL to be used by proceeding with the following substitution algo­ rithm on the provided CallbackUrl:

- If key MTaer is present, the manufacturer custom flow having received the initial query contain­ ing the CallbackUrl SHALL substitute the placeholder value "\_" (i.e. in MTaer=\_) in the CallbackUrl with the final status of the access extension request flow which SHALL be one of the following. Any value returned in the MTaer field not listed above SHALL be considered an error and SHALL be treated as GeneralFailure.

  - Success - The flow completed successfully and the ARL attribute was updated. The client MAY now read the ARL attribute to determine the new access restrictions.

  - NoChange - The ARL attribute was already listing minimum restrictions for the requesting fabric.

  - GeneralFailure - The flow failed for an unspecified reason.

  - FlowAuthFailure - The user failed to authenticate to the flow.

  - NotFound - Access extension failed because the target fabric was not found.

> A manufacturer custom flow having received an ExpandedARLRequestFlowUrl SHOULD attempt to open the ExpandedARLRequestCallbackUrl, on completion of the request, if an ExpandedARLRequest­ CallbackUrl was computed from the CallbackUrl and opening such a URL is supported.
>
> **Examples of ARLRequestFlowUrl URLs**
>
> Below are some examples of valid ExpandedARLRequestFlowUrl for several valid values of ARLRequest­ FlowUrl, as well as some examples of invalid values of ARLRequestFlowUrl:

- Invalid URL with no query string: http scheme is not allowed:

  - <http://company.domain.example/matter/arl/vFFF1p1234>

- Valid URL :

  - <https://company.domain.example/matter/arl/vFFF1p1234>

- Valid URL, CallbackUrl requested:

  - Before expansion:

  - After expansion:

&nbsp;

- The ExpandedARLRequestFlowUrl URL contains:

  - A CallbackUrl with a client-provided arbitrary token= key/value pair and the MTaer= key/value pair place-holder to indicate support for a return access extension completion status: <https://client.domain.example/cb?token=mAsJ6_vqbr-vjDiG_w%3D%3D&MTaer=_>

  - After expansion of the CallbackUrl (MTcu key) into an ExpandedCallbackUrl, with an exam­ ple return access extension completion status of Success, the ExpandedARLRequestCall­ backUrl would be:

> Note that the MTcu key/value pair was initially provided URL-encoded within the ExpandedARLRequestFlowUrl URL and the MTaer=\_ key/value pair placeholder now contains a substituted returned completion status.

- Invalid URL, due to MTza=79 key/value pair in reserved MT-prefixed keys reserved for future use:

&nbsp;

- <https://company.domain.example/matter/arl?vid=FFF1&pid=1234&MTop=_&MTza=79>

## Group Relationship

> A group is a collection of one or more endpoints on one or more nodes. A group is identified by a unique group ID. If the network supports fabrics, each group, its group ID, and nodes that are mem­ bers of the group, are all scoped to a single fabric.
>
> Conceptually, there is a Group Table on each node that represents endpoint group membership. Each Group Table entry maps a group ID to one or more endpoints on that node, and any endpoint on a node MAY be assigned to one or more groups.
>
> A group relationship, that is contained in the Group Table, is managed through the endpoints using the Groups cluster.
>
> The Interaction Model allows a group identifier to be used as the destination of a message or action. If a message received by a node has a group destination, the Group Table is checked to see which endpoints on the node are members of the group. Then, the message will be delivered to those end­ points.
>
> Note that there is a risk that multiple clients allocate the same group identifier for their own pur­ pose. This likely leads to undesired behavior. For this reason, a client SHOULD discover the unique­ ness of their 'candidate' group ID.
>
> Also note that groupcast relies on its support by the underlying network layer. Depending on this network layer, groupcast may not work to "sleepy" devices that have their radio turned off when idle to preserve battery lifetime.

## Bridge for non-Matter devices

### Introduction

> A Bridge serves to allow the use of non-Matter IoT devices (e.g. devices on a Zigbee or Z-Wave net­ work, or any other non-Matter connectivity technology) in a Matter Fabric, with the goal to enable the consumer to keep using these non-Matter devices together with their Matter devices.
>
> This is illustrated in the figure below: the non-Matter devices are exposed as Bridged Devices to Nodes on the Fabric. The Matter Nodes can communicate with both the (native) Matter devices as well as the Bridged Devices (by virtue of the Bridge which performs the translation between Matter and the other protocol).

[TABLE]

> *Figure 47. principle of bridging*

#### NOTE

> The bridging-concept described here is NOT intended to be used to expose Matter Nodes (which are not on the Fabric) to a Fabric, since direct connection of those Matter Nodes to the Fabric would provide a better experience.
>
> This section will describe how the Data Model concepts can be used by a Bridge to expose the Bridged Devices in such a way that they can be discovered and used by Nodes on the Matter Fabric.

### Exposing functionality and metadata of Bridged Devices

> After Commissioning, the Bridge SHALL expose (at least) one Node to the Fabric. The device imple­ menting the Bridge MAY have more than one Node. This, however, is orthogonal to the bridging concept and will not be discussed further here.

- On this Node, the Bridge SHALL expose a set of endpoints representing the various Bridged Devices on the non-Matter side of the Bridge.

&nbsp;

- Additionally, it SHALL expose an endpoint with the device type Aggregator which has a [Descrip­](#descriptor-cluster) [tor](#descriptor-cluster) cluster with a PartsList attribute containing all the endpoints representing those Bridged Devices.

- Each Bridged Device is represented by one or more endpoints listed in this PartsList (see [Infor­](#information-about-bridged-devices) [mation about Bridged Devices](#information-about-bridged-devices) and examples below). The Descriptor cluster on the correspond­ ing endpoint provides information about the particular Bridged Device, such as its device type(s).

> The PartsList on endpoint 1 lists all endpoints for bridged devices; each endpoint 11..16 represents one device at the non-Matter side of the bridge.

>
> In case the Bridge is bridging to/from multiple technologies (or has some other logical distinction between groups of bridged devices), it MAY expose such groups as two or more such hierarchical trees each with their Aggregator device type (e.g. one for each technology, see figure below); it MAY also combine all bridged devices in one hierarchical tree (see figure above). Both figures have the same set of bridged devices - the difference is in how the bridge manufacturer decides to expose them as one or multiple sets.

> A Bridge typically has information on topology or logical grouping of the Bridged Devices, which can be of use to Nodes on the Matter Fabric.

- For example, consider a Bridge with 50 lights. If this exposure of grouping, and their naming, would not be present, the user would just see a list of 50 lights on their controller and would not know which of those physical lights would be in which location/group.

> If a Bridge has such information on topology or logical grouping, it SHOULD expose such informa­ tion in the EndpointLists attribute of an [Actions](#actions-cluster) cluster (the ActionLists of which MAY be empty if no actions are exposed). A Bridge MAY make it possible (e.g., through a Bridge Manufacturer’s app) for its users to restrict whether all or some of such information is exposed to the Fabric. The Node on the Fabric using the Bridged Devices which is interested in using such topology or logical group­ ing (e.g. to show the grouping of lights per room in an overview to the user), SHOULD derive such grouping (and associated naming) from this EndpointLists attribute.
>
> In the example below, the devices are split over two rooms, as exposed in the EndpointLists attribute. This example also illustrates a composed endpoint for a composed Bridged Device, in this case a lighting device (Bridged Device at EP 24,25,26) which has an up- and downlighter which can be controlled separately, and which have their own set of lighting-related clusters on an individual endpoint (EP 25,26). Note that the Bridged Device Basic Information cluster is at the top of the hier­ archy for this composed device (EP 24), while the application device types and application clusters are at the leaf endpoints (EP 25,26).
>
> Since EP 25,26 are listed in the PartsList of EP 24, they 'inherit' the Bridged Node device type and information in the Bridged Device Basic Information cluster of EP 24.

#### Native Matter functionality in Bridge

> The Bridge MAY also contain native Matter functionality, i.e. non-bridged functionality, such as in the example below, which shows a smart speaker device having, in addition to a Wi-Fi connection, also a Zigbee connection towards a number of Zigbee lights. The speaker functionality (EP 31) is native Matter functionality (and could have a Controller role to allow sending Matter commands upon receiving voice commands), while the remainder of the non-zero endpoints represent the Bridged Devices.

#### Information about Bridged Devices

> For each Bridged Device, the Bridge SHALL include a [Bridged Device Basic Information](#bridged-device-basic-information-cluster) cluster on the endpoint which represents this Bridged Device. In case a Bridged Device is represented by mul­ tiple endpoints, the Bridged Device Basic Information cluster SHALL only be present on the end­ point which is the top level of the hierarchy representing this Bridged Device (example: endpoint 24 in [Figure 50, “example of endpoints representing Bridged Devices using grouping”](#_bookmark1018)).
>
> On this endpoint with the Bridged Device Basic Information cluster, the Bridge SHALL also include a [Descriptor](#descriptor-cluster) cluster with

- a DeviceTypeList attribute containing device type Bridged Node plus the device type(s) of the Bridged Device, and

- a PartsList attribute listing any other endpoints which jointly expose the functionality of this Bridged Device.

> **Information about power sources for Bridged Devices**
>
> In case the Bridged Device contains a power source such as battery or mains power feed, *and* infor­ mation about the state of that power source is available to the Bridge, the Bridge SHALL also include one or more [Power Source](#power-source-cluster) cluster(s), where their EndpointList attribute SHALL contain the endpoint(s) of the Bridged Device that are powered by this power source. Each endpoint with a Power Source cluster SHALL have the related Power Source device type in its DeviceTypeList.
>
> For Bridged Devices which are represented by a single endpoint:

- The [Power Source](#power-source-cluster) cluster SHALL be included on that single endpoint. An example of this is shown for the battery-powered temperature sensor on endpoint 23 in [Figure 50, “example of](#_bookmark1018) [endpoints representing Bridged Devices using grouping”](#_bookmark1018).

> For Bridged Devices which are represented by multiple endpoints:

- If the Bridged Device contains only one power source, the Power Source cluster SHALL be present on an endpoint which corresponds to the part of the Bridged Device being powered by the power source.

  - In case this power source provides power to the entire Bridged Device, the power source cluster SHALL be on the endpoint where the Bridged Node device type is located, and con­ tain an EndpointList attribute containing all the endpoints constituting the Bridged Device.

> In case a Bridged Device does not contain a power source such as battery or mains power feed, *or* information about the state of that power source is not available to the Bridge, the Bridge SHALL NOT include a [Power Source](#power-source-cluster) cluster on the endpoint(s) representing the Bridged Device.

#### Clusters for Bridged Device functionality (device types)

> For each Bridged Device, the Bridge SHALL expose the clusters required for a device of the indi­ cated Matter device type(s).
>
> This allows the Matter Nodes to recognize the device type of the Bridged Device and interact with its clusters in the same manner as with a native Matter Node of that device type.

#### Identify for Bridge and Bridged Devices

> If the bridge has a mechanism to identify itself to the user (e.g. blinking LED on the bridge itself), the associated Identify cluster SHOULD be used on the endpoint with the Aggregator device type.
>
> For the identification function of individual bridged devices, the conformance for the associated Identify cluster is determined by the application device types on the endpoint(s) representing the bridged device. For example, in the composed lighting device in [Figure 50, “example of endpoints](#_bookmark1018) [representing Bridged Devices using grouping”](#_bookmark1018), each of the endpoints 25 and 26 would have an iden­ tify cluster to allow individual identification of each of those lights.

### Discovery of Bridged Devices

> A Node which discovers another Node with device type Aggregator on one of its endpoints SHOULD walk the entire tree of endpoints via the PartsList attributes and endpoints to discover the list of Bridged Devices, including their device types and other attributes, as well as any native Matter functionality potentially present on the Node.
>
> Each endpoint found containing a Bridged Node device type represents a Bridged Device of the
>
> device type(s) specified at this endpoint, or one of the endpoints found via its PartsList. If the dis­ covering Node supports this device type, it MAY add this Bridged Device to the list of devices which it could interact with, or could set up configuration for.
>
> This discovering Node SHALL use the acquired information on the available Bridged Devices to set up (configure) (likely with input from the user) how the Bridged Devices can be used with the Mat­ ter Nodes (e.g. which switch controls which light, or how to control a light from an app on the user’s phone).
>
> Since the Bridge may expose a large number of Bridged Devices, the discovering Node SHALL use the NodeLabel attribute in the Bridged Device Basic Information cluster of each of the Bridged Devices to allow the user to easily identify and recognize the various Bridged Devices, and expedite
>
> the setup/configuration process, rather than present the user with an unannotated list of, for exam­ ple, 20 lights, 3 sensors and 4 switches. These labels have likely been populated by the user when interacting previously with the Bridge e.g. through means provided by the Bridge Manufacturer, such as a Bridge Manufacturer app.
>
> If power source-related information regarding the Bridged Device is provided in the Power Source
>
> cluster on the associated endpoint, the discovering Node SHOULD use this information in a similar manner as power source-related information acquired from a Matter Node’s Power Source cluster. Such information can then be used to inform the user about the state of the power source (e.g.
>
> warn about low batteries) in a Bridged Device in a similar manner as done for Matter Nodes.

### Configuration of Bridged Devices

> For configuration of the discovered Bridged Devices, two basic archetypes are described in the fol­ lowing sections: one for actuators and one for sensors/switches.
>
> Since a Bridged Device of a certain device type has the same set of application clusters as a native Matter device of the same device type, this process is similar to configuring a native Matter device of that device type.

#### Sending commands from a Matter controller to a Bridged Device

> For Bridged Devices that are actuators and hence have a Controlee role, a Controller Node on the Fabric MAY send commands to the associated clusters on one or more endpoints on the Bridge’s Node, such as an On command to the On/Off cluster of a Bridged Device. The Bridge SHALL forward this command to the relevant Bridged Device after conversion between the Matter protocol and the non-Matter device’s native protocol.
>
> Example:
>
> A Controller creates a Group containing some Matter lights as well as some non-Matter lights, by sending an Add Group command to the instances of the Group cluster on both the endpoints of the Matter lights as well as on the Bridge’s Node endpoints representing the targeted bridged lights.
>
> Similarly, the Controller creates one or more Scenes using the instances of the Scenes Management
>
> cluster on these endpoints.
>
> The Controller then sends a (single) On command (On/Off cluster) to this group to switch on all these lights in a single operation. This (single) multicast message will be received (and interpreted) by the Matter lights which are part of this group as well as by the Bridge, which will forward it (after appropriate protocol conversion) to the relevant bridged lights.
>
> Similarly, the Controller sends a (single) Move to Level (Level Control cluster) or sends a (single) Recall Scene (Scenes Management cluster) to this group, to set the brightness resp. recall a scene con­ tents on all these lights in a single operation.

#### Receiving status/events/commands from a Bridged Device

> For Bridged Devices like sensors and switches, the Bridge will receive value updates (e.g. Zigbee attribute reports), events and/or commands from those devices, and SHALL (after conversion from the native protocol of the non-Matter devices towards Matter protocol) represent those as attrib­ utes, events and/or commands in the appropriate clusters on the associated endpoints of the Bridge. Interactions with those attributes/events/commands on the Matter side (e.g., towards a Controller using the sensor/switch data) SHOULD be identical to interactions with corresponding attrib­ utes/events/commands in native Matter sensors and switches (e.g., attribute readout and subscrip­ tion, proxying and eventing).
>
> Examples:

- A temperature sensor sends a status report to the Bridge over a non-Matter interface. The logic in the Bridge processes this as an update to the Measured Value attribute of the Temperature Mea­ surement cluster on the endpoint associated with this bridged sensor.

> Nodes on the Fabric which have an interest in this value can read the updated attribute value, and can configure a subscription on this attribute. This is identical to reading an attribute value or setting up an attribute subscription on a native-Matter temperature sensor Node.

- A user presses a button on a (push-button) switch device. The switch device sends a message to

> the Bridge over a non-Matter interface. The logic in the Bridge processes this to generate an Ini­ tialPress event (Switch cluster) on the endpoint representing the switch.
>
> Nodes on the Fabric which have an interest in the switch operation can setup eventing from this cluster.

### New features for Bridged Devices

> Bridged Devices can have their software updated independently of the Bridge, through Bridge Man­ ufacturer-specific means. These updates MAY result in one or more changes to their capabilities, such as supported clusters and/or attributes, for an endpoint. Like every Matter Node, every end­ point on the Bridge’s Node contains a Descriptor cluster that contains attributes for the device types (DeviceTypeList), endpoints (PartsList) and supported clusters (ServerList and ClientList). Nodes that wish to be notified of such changes SHOULD monitor changes of these attributes.

### Changes to the set of Bridged Devices

> Bridged Devices can be added to or removed from the Bridge through Bridge-specific means. For example, the user can use a Manufacturer-provided app to add/remove Zigbee devices to/from their Matter-Zigbee Bridge.
>
> When an update to the set of Bridged Devices (which are exposed according to the [Section 9.12.11,](#best-practices-for-bridge-manufacturers) [“Best practices for Bridge Manufacturers”](#best-practices-for-bridge-manufacturers)) occurs, the Bridge SHALL

- on the Descriptor clusters of the [root node endpoint](#root-node-endpoint) and of the endpoint which holds the Aggre­ gator device type: update the PartsList attribute (add/remove entries from this list)

- update the exposed endpoints and their descriptors according to the new set of Bridged Devices

> Nodes that wish to be notified of added/removed devices SHOULD monitor changes of the PartsList attribute in the Descriptor cluster on the [root node endpoint](#root-node-endpoint) and the endpoint which holds the Aggregator device type.
>
> Allocation of endpoints for Bridged Devices SHALL be performed as described in [Dynamic End­](#dynamic-endpoint-allocation) [point allocation](#dynamic-endpoint-allocation).

### Changes to device names and grouping of Bridged Devices

> Typically, the user has some means (e.g. a Manufacturer-provided app) to assign names to the Bridged Devices, or names could be assigned automatically by the Bridge. The Bridge SHALL expose such names in the NodeLabel attribute of the Bridged Device Basic Information cluster on the applicable endpoint.
>
> Similarly, the user typically has some means to group the Bridged Devices (e.g. via a room/zone-con­ cept) and provide names to such groups, or grouping could be applied automatically by the Bridge. The Bridge SHOULD expose such grouping using the EndpointLists attribute of the Actions cluster as described above.
>
> For such exposed information, when there is a change in naming/grouping (e.g. the user makes changes via a Manufacturer-provided app), the Bridge SHALL update the appropriate attributes.
>
> Nodes that wish to be notified of a change in such a name or grouping SHOULD monitor changes of this attribute or cluster.

### Setup flow for a Bridge (plus Bridged Devices)

> As described above, the Bridge together with its Bridged Devices is exposed as a single Node with a list of endpoints. Consequently, a single Node ID and a single Operational Certificate is assigned during Commissioning and a single pass through the commissioning flow is required to bring the Bridge (along with its Bridged Devices) onto a Fabric. This provides for a simple user experience, since the user only needs to go through the commissioning flow for the Bridge, and not separately for each of the Bridged Devices.

### Access Control

> The Bridge is a Matter node, therefore it has a single [Access Control Cluster](#access-control-cluster) for the entire Node, like every other Matter Node. This cluster contains all [Access Control Entries](#acl-attribute) for each of its endpoints, including for all Bridged Devices and other native Matter functionality exposed by the Bridge Node. A typical setup of Access Control would reflect which privilege level a Matter Controller needs to have for one or more Bridged Devices. This overall access set may be a subset of all the Bridged Devices on the Bridge, rather than all endpoints on a Bridge. This can be accomplished by setting an Access Control Entry containing as targets a list of those endpoints representing a Bridged Device or a set of Bridged Devices. As defined in [the ACL model](#model), it is also possible to specify access towards specific [Targets](#accesscontroltargetstruct-type), for example all Bridged Devices of device type Extended Color Light.

### Software update (OTA)

> The Bridge is a Matter device and its Matter-related functionality MAY be updated using the mecha­ nism described in [Section 11.20, “Over-the-Air (OTA) Software Update”](#over-the-air-ota-software-update).
>
> The Bridged Devices, on the other hand, are not native Matter devices, do not have a Product ID, and are not listed in the [Distributed Compliance Ledger](#distributed-compliance-ledger). They are typically updated using a mecha­ nism defined and deployed by the Bridge Manufacturer. That same mechanism is typically used to update the parts of the Bridge which are not related to Matter, which is particularly relevant to allow synchronization of updates to the non-Matter part of the Bridge with updates to the Bridged
>
> Devices. Obviously, such mechanism MAY also be employed to update the entire Bridge firmware, including the Matter-related functionality.

### Best practices for Bridge Manufacturers

> This section summarizes (in order of priority) the process to determine which non-Matter devices the Bridge exposes to the Fabric.

1.  Choice of supported device types

    - A Manufacturer MAY choose which of the Matter device types they can or want to support in the Bridge. After implementation of support for bridging of those device types, they SHALL certify the Bridge for those device types.

    - By default, a Bridge SHOULD expose to the Fabric all its connected non-Matter devices which can be mapped to a Matter device type for which that Bridge is certified.

> E.g., if a Bridge is certified for Matter light bulbs, it SHOULD NOT hide any light bulb on the non-Matter side from the Fabric by default (some situations where the Bridge MAY deviate from this recommendation are in the following text).

- Given the wide variety of device types on a wide variety of standards, there may be device types on the non-Matter side that do not have a corresponding Matter device type. Such devices cannot be bridged to a Matter device type. The Manufacturer MAY choose to not expose such devices with the Bridge or MAY expose them with a manufacturer-specific device type and/or manufacturer-specific clusters.

2.  Compatibility issues

    - For the device types for which a Bridge is certified, a Bridge Manufacturer MAY decide to not expose certain devices based on any reason, including compatibility and interoperabil­ ity reasons, or to expose them in a 'best-effort' manner as needed.

      - The Bridge Manufacturer may choose to not expose a device that does not support cer­ tain functions or features which are mandatory for a Matter device type, but which are defined as optional, or not defined at all, in the specification for the corresponding device type on the non-Matter side of the bridge. Such a Bridge would expose to the Fab­ ric only Bridged Devices of device types which support those particular control functions or features which are required.

      - The Bridge Manufacturer may also choose to map or emulate such features which are not available in the Bridged Device; example: for a bridged colored light connected via a protocol which does not support scenes, the Bridge could emulate the scene function by storing the scenes in the Bridge and sending corresponding brightness and color com­ mands to the light when a Scene Recall command is received from a Matter Node.

3.  User choice

    - A Bridge MAY make it possible (e.g., through a Bridge Manufacturer’s app) for its users to further restrict which devices are exposed to the Fabric.

> For example, a user may decide to prevent exposure to the Fabric of certain Devices Types, such as all occupancy sensors, or of only certain devices of a certain device type, such as only their bedroom occupancy sensor.

### Best practices for Administrators

> An Administrator MAY indicate to users which devices are native Matter and which ones are Bridged Devices, as determined using the presence of a Bridged Node device type on the endpoint, in order to ensure the user does not make assumptions about the Bridged Devices having the same security requirements as native Matter devices.

## Bridged Device Basic Information Cluster

> This cluster is a derived cluster of the Basic Information cluster and serves two purposes towards a Node communicating with a Bridge:

- Indicate that the functionality on the Endpoint where it is placed (and its Parts) is bridged, and

- Provide a centralized collection of attributes that the Node MAY collect to aid in conveying information regarding the Bridged Device to a user, such as the vendor name, the model name, or user-assigned name.

> This cluster SHALL be exposed by a Bridge on the Endpoint representing each Bridged Device. When the functionality of a Bridged Device is represented using a set of Endpoints, this cluster SHALL only be exposed on the Endpoint which is at the top of the hierarchy for the functionality of that Bridged Device.
>
> This cluster SHALL NOT be used on an endpoint that is not in the Descriptor cluster PartsList of an endpoint with an Aggregator device type.
>
> This cluster has been derived from the [Basic Information](#basic-information-cluster) Cluster, and provides generic information about the Bridged Device. Not all of the attributes in the Basic Information Cluster are relevant for a Bridged Device (e.g. ProductID since it is not a Matter device). For other attributes, the informa­ tion which is listed as Mandatory for the Basic Information Cluster, may not be available when the Bridged Device does not provide it to the Bridge, and the Bridge has no other means to determine it. For such cases where the information for a particular attribute is not available, the Bridge SHOULD NOT include the attribute in the cluster for this Bridged Device. See below for Conformance details.

> Since this cluster has been derived from the [Basic Information](#basic-information-cluster) Cluster, the identifiers of the attrib­ utes, their range, quality and default characteristics and their descriptions correspond to those in that Cluster and those descriptions are not repeated here. Several attributes from the Basic Infor­ mation Cluster which are *not* relevant or applicable for a Bridged Device have been marked with X in column Conformance and SHALL NOT be used in the Bridged Device Basic Information Cluster.
>
> The Conformance characteristics of several attributes in this cluster have changed from M to O compared to their Conformance in the Basic Information Cluster, and SHALL be used according to the table above.
>
> The Bridge SHOULD fill these attributes with the available information, which could e.g. come from
>
> the Bridged Device provided to the Bridge over the non-Matter interface (e.g. VendorName and Ven­ dorID) or could have been provided by the user (e.g. assigned name of a device for NodeLabel).
>
> If the manufacturer of a Bridged Device is known to the Bridge, the Bridge SHALL provide this name (in attribute VendorName), otherwise it SHALL NOT include this attribute.
>
> If the manufacturer of a Bridged Device and the associated Alliance-assigned [Vendor ID](#vendor-identifier-vendor-id-vid) are known to the Bridge (e.g. by copying the Manufacturer Code from the Node Descriptor of a Zigbee device or the Basic Information cluster of a Matter device), the Bridge SHALL provide this identifier (in attribute VendorID), otherwise it SHALL NOT include this attribute. If the associated [Product ID](#product-identifier-product-id-pid) of a bridged Matter device is known to the Bridge (e.g. from the Basic Information cluster of the bridged Matter device), the Bridge SHALL provide this identifier (in attribute ProductID), otherwise it SHALL NOT include this attribute. For bridged non-Matter devices, the ProductID attribute SHALL NOT be included.

#### Reachable Attribute

> This attribute SHALL be used to indicate whether the bridged device is reachable by the bridge, so a Matter Node which wants to communicate with a bridged device can get an indication that this might fail (when the attribute is False). Determination of reachability might not be perfect (e.g. depending on technology employed), so the Matter Node SHOULD be aware of the risk of false posi­ tives and negatives on reachability determination. For example, a bridged device MAY be marked as unreachable while it could actually be reached, and vice-versa. Also, detection (and indication) that a bridged device is not longer reachable may be delayed due to the technique employed (e.g. detecting that a number of expected messages from the bridged device did not arrive). Also see event ReachableChanged below.

#### UniqueID Attribute

> This attribute SHALL, for a Bridged Device, be updated when the Bridge is factory reset. If the bridged device does not provide some unique id (e.g. in the case of bridging from non-Matter devices, or in case of bridging Matter devices from an earlier revision which were not required to provide a UniqueID attribute), the bridge SHALL generate a unique id on behalf of the bridged device.
>
> **NOTE** The UniqueID attribute was optional in cluster revisions prior to revision 4.

#### KeepActive Command

> Upon receipt, the server SHALL attempt to keep the bridged device active for the duration specified by the command, when the device is next active.
>
> The implementation of this is best-effort since it may interact with non-native protocols. However, several specific protocol requirements are:

- If the bridged device is a Matter Intermittently Connected Device, then the server SHALL send a [StayActiveRequest](#stayactiverequest-command) command with the StayActiveDuration field set to value of the StayActiveDu­ ration field in the received command to the bridged device when the bridged device next sends a checks-in message or subscription report. See [Intermittently Connected Devices Behavior](#intermittently-connected-devices-behavior) for details on ICD state management.

> When the bridge detects that the bridged device goes into an active state, an ActiveChanged event SHALL be generated.
>
> In order to avoid unnecessary power consumption in the bridged device:

- The server SHALL enter a "pending active" state for the associated device when the KeepActive command is received. The server "pending active" state SHALL expire after the amount of time defined by the TimeoutMs field, in milliseconds, if no subsequent KeepActive command is received. When a KeepActive command is received, the "pending active" state is set, the StayAc­ tiveDuration is updated to the greater of the new value and the previously stored value, and the TimeoutMs is updated to the greater of the new value and the remaining time until the prior "pending active" state expires.

- The server SHALL only keep the bridged device active once for a request. (The server SHALL only consider the operation performed if an associated ActiveChanged event was generated.)

> This command SHALL have the following data fields:

[TABLE]

> **StayActiveDuration Field**
>
> This field SHALL indicate the duration, in milliseconds, that the device is requested to remain active, once the device becomes active again.
>
> The value of this field MAY be longer than the value supported by the bridged device and would, typically, be used by the client to request the server of the bridged device to stay active and respon­ sive for this period to allow a sequence of message exchanges during that period.
>
> The client MAY slightly overestimate the duration it wants the bridged device to be active for, in order to account for network delays.
>
> **TimeoutMs Field**
>
> This field SHALL indicate the period, in milliseconds, that the server will wait before the "pending active" state expires. See the [KeepActive Command](#keepactive-command) description for details.
>
> **NOTE** TimeoutMs is a timeout for the request, NOT the time the device will be awake for. The server will wait for up to TimeoutMs for the device. If after TimeoutMs the ICD
>
> device does NOT check-in, the server will not perform any actions.

### Events

> This cluster SHALL support these events:

| **ID** | **Name** | **Priority** | **Quality** | **Access** | **Conformance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0x00 | **StartUp** |  |  |  | O |
| 0x01 | **ShutDown** |  |  |  | O |
| 0x02 | **Leave** |  |  |  | O |
| 0x03 | **Reach­ ableChanged** |  |  |  | M |
| 0x80 | **ActiveChange d** | INFO |  | V | BIS |

#### Leave Event

> The Leave event SHOULD be generated by the bridge when it detects that the associated device has left the non-Matter network.
>
> The data of this event SHALL contain the following information:

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **FabricIndex** |  |  |  |  | X |

#### NOTE

> The FabricIndex field has the X conformance, indicating it SHALL NOT be present. This event, in the context of Bridged Device Basic Information cluster, has no usable fields, but the original Basic Information cluster’s field definition is kept for com­ pleteness.

#### ReachableChanged Event

> This event SHALL be generated when there is a change in the Reachable attribute. Its purpose is to provide an indication towards interested parties that the reachability of a bridged device has changed over its native connectivity technology, so they MAY take appropriate action.
>
> After (re)start of a bridge this event MAY be generated.

#### ActiveChanged Event

> This event (when supported) SHALL be generated the next time a bridged device becomes active after a KeepActive command is received.
>
> See [KeepActive](#keepactive-command) for more details.
>
> The data of this event SHALL contain the following information:

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **PromisedAc tiveDura­ tion** | uint32 | desc |  |  | M |

> **PromisedActiveDuration Field**
>
> This field SHALL indicate the minimum duration, in milliseconds, that the bridged device will remain active after receiving the initial request from the [KeepActive](#keepactive-command) processing steps.
>
> If the bridged device is a Matter Intermittently Connected Device, PromisedActiveDuration SHALL be set to the PromisedActiveDuration value returned in the [StayActiveResponse](#stayactiveresponse-command) command.
>
> If the bridged device is not a Matter Intermittently Connected Device, the implementation of this is best-effort since it may interact with non-native protocol.

## Actions Cluster

> This cluster provides a standardized way for a Node (typically a Bridge, but could be any Node) to expose

- Information about logical grouping of endpoints on the Node (example: lights in a room)

- Information about named actions that can be performed on such a group of endpoints (exam­ ple: recall a scene for a group of lights by its name)

- Commands to trigger such actions

- Events to receive feedback on the state of such actions.

> The information on grouping and available actions is typically provided by the user or Bridge man­ ufacturer via some means not defined in Matter, and therefore provided as read-only to Nodes. For example: a manufacturer-provided app allows a user to set up logical grouping and create/assign scene for such groups.
>
> Using this cluster, a Node can learn about such logical grouping, provided actions, and trigger such actions.
>
> While the origin of this cluster stems from use cases with a Bridge, its server side may also be implemented on any Node which can expose certain grouping, actions or automations to other users.
>
> After defining the attributes, commands and events for this cluster, and the associated data types, several [examples](#examples-3) are provided to illustrate the capabilities of this cluster.
>
> Actions can be defined in a flexible manner to suit the needs of the various nodes implementing this cluster. For each action, the commands available for that particular action are defined.
>
> This cluster can be used to expose only the grouping of endpoints without any actions defined by populating the EndpointList attribute accordingly and providing an empty list for ActionList.
>
> The term 'action' in the description of this cluster should not be confused with the term ['action'](#_bookmark853) as used in the Interaction Model.

| **Value** | **Name** | **Summary** | **Conformance** |
|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **Other** | Use this only when none of the other val­ ues applies | M |
| 1 | **Scene** | Bring the endpoints into a certain state | M |
| 2 | **Sequence** | A sequence of states with a certain time pat­ tern | M |

| 5 | **Notification** | Use the endpoints to send a message to user | M |
| 6 | **Alarm** | Higher priority notifi­ cation | M |

> **Scene Value**
>
> Can be used to set a static state of the associated endpoints (typically using InstantAction or Instan­ tActionWithTransition), or to bring these endpoints into a more dynamic state (typically using Star­ tAction), where the endpoints would e.g. gradually cycle through certain colors for a pleasing effect. A voice controller could use "set" (to map to InstantAction) or "play" (to map to StartAction) to trig­
>
> ger such actions.
>
> Example: see [examples 1 and 2](#example-1-scene-recall).
>
> **Sequence Value**
>
> Indicates an action which involves a sequence of events/states of the associated endpoints, such as a wake-up experience.
>
> Example: see [example 4](#example-4-wake-up-routine).
>
> **Automation Value**
>
> Indications an automation (e.g. a motion sensor controlling lights, an alarm system) which can be
>
> e.g. started, stopped, paused, resumed. Example: see [example 3](#example-3-pause-sensor-automation).
>
> **Exception Value**
>
> Indicates some action which the server will execute when a certain condition (which normally does not happen) is not met.
>
> Example: lock the doors when the server’s system has detected no one is at home while the doors are in the 'unlocked' state.
>
> **Notification Value**
>
> Indicates an action that can be triggered (e.g. by InstantAction) to notify the user.
>
> Example: play a pattern on the lights in the living room if there is someone in the garden in the evening.
>
> **Alarm Value**
>
> Similar to Notification but with a higher priority (and might override other endpoint states which Type=Notification would *not* override).
>
> Example: flash all lights in the house when CO sensor triggers.

#### ActionStateEnum Type

> This data type is derived from [enum8](#enumeration-type-8-bit-16-bit).

| **Value** | **Name**     | **Summary**                  | **Conformance** |
|-----------|--------------|------------------------------|-----------------|
| 0         | **Inactive** | The action is not active     | M               |
| 1         | **Active**   | The action is active         | M               |
| 2         | **Paused**   | The action has been paused   | M               |
| 3         | **Disabled** | The action has been disabled | M               |

> Note that some of these states are applicable only for certain actions, as determined by their Sup­ portedCommands.

#### ActionErrorEnum Type

> This data type is derived from [enum8](#enumeration-type-8-bit-16-bit).

| **Value** | **Name** | **Summary** | **Conformance** |
|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **Unknown** | Other reason not listed in the row(s) below | M |
| 1 | **Interrupted** | The action was inter­ rupted by another com­ mand or interaction | M |

#### EndpointListTypeEnum Type

> This data type is derived from enum8 and has its values listed below.

| **Value** | **Name** | **Summary** | **Conformance** |
|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **Other** | Another group of end­ points | M |
| 1 | **Room** | User-configured group of endpoints where an endpoint can be in only one room | M |
| 2 | **Zone** | User-configured group of endpoints where an endpoint can be in any number of zones | M |

> The Room and Zone values are provided for the cases where a user (or the system on behalf of the user) has created logical grouping of the endpoints (e.g. bridged devices) based on location.
>
> **Other Value**
>
> This value is provided for the case of an endpoint list which is tied specifically to this action i.e. not independently created by the user. For Type=Other the Name MAY be empty. A Matter controller would typically not use this for anything else than just to know which endpoints would be affected by the action.
>
> **Room Value**
>
> Is used for the situation where an endpoint can only be part of one such rooms (e.g. physical map­ ping). Using these exposed logical groups, a Matter controller who has a similar grouping concept can use it to place each endpoint (bridged device) in the right room automatically, without user having to redo that setup for each device in each system - both at first contact and upon later updates to the endpoints (e.g. user adds a bridged device or creates a new room).
>
> **Zone Value**
>
> Is a more general concept where an endpoint can be part of multiple zones, e.g. a light in the living
>
> room can be part of the "reading corner" zone (subset of the lights in the living room) but also part of the "downstairs" zone which contains all the lights on a floor, e.g. combining living room, kitchen and hallway. This indicates that a user has defined this list of endpoints as something they logically would like to control as a group, so Matter controllers could provide the user with a way to do as such.

#### EndpointLists Attribute

> The EndpointLists attribute holds the list of endpoint lists. Each entry SHALL have an unique End­ pointListID.

#### SetupURL Attribute

> The SetupURL attribute (when provided) SHALL indicate a URL; its syntax SHALL follow the syntax as specified in [RFC 1738](#_bookmark43), max. 512 ASCII characters and SHALL use the https scheme. The location referenced by this URL SHALL provide additional information for the actions provided:

- When used without suffix, it SHALL provide information about the various actions which the cluster provides.

  - Example: SetupURL could take the value of example://Actions or [https://domain.example/](https://domain.example/Matter/bridgev1/Actions) [Matter/bridgev1/Actions](https://domain.example/Matter/bridgev1/Actions) for this generic case (access generic info how to use actions pro­ vided by this cluster).

- When used with a suffix of "/?a=" and the decimal value of ActionID for one of the actions, it MAY provide information about that particular action. This could be a deeplink to manufac­ turer-app/website (associated somehow to the server node) with the information/edit-screen for this action so that the user can view and update details of the action, e.g. edit the scene, or change the wake-up experience time period.

  - Example of SetupURL with suffix added: example://Actions/?a=12345 or <https://domain.example/Matter/bridgev1/Actions/?a=12345> for linking to specific info/editing of the action with ActionID 0x3039.

> Conformance: a server SHALL support a command when it is listed in the SupportedCommands data field of one or more actions listed in the ActionList provided by the server.
>
> Some general requirements and data fields for all the commands:

- The ActionID data field SHALL indicate the action identifier. If there is no entry the in ActionList holding the same action identifier, a response SHALL be generated with the StatusCode NOT\_­ FOUND.

- The InvokeID data field MAY be provided by the client when invoking a command. When this value is provided, the server SHALL generate a [StateChanged](#statechanged-event) event when the action changes to a new state or an [ActionFailed](#actionfailed-event) event when execution of the action fails; in the data of such events, the value of the InvokeID data field from the invoke will be provided, so that the client can relate the event back to the corresponding command. It is up to the client to determine which value is provided in InvokeID. When sending multiple commands for the same action, with different InvokeID, the server SHALL provide in the event the InvokeID value from the most recent command for a particular ActionID.

- If the command refers to an action which currently is not in a state where the command applies, a response SHALL be generated with the StatusCode INVALID_COMMAND.

- Actions are typically mapped to state changes of the involved endpoints. Those endpoints can also be controlled with commands from other clusters, controlled by other nodes and impacted by non-Matter interactions (e.g. local controls). Such other interactions can cause the state of the endpoints to differ from the results of the command which triggered the action. A client inter­ ested in such changes can use the InvokeID data field (see above) to receive events State­ Changed and ActionFailed for feedback for such cases.

#### InstantAction Command

> This command SHALL have the following data fields:

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **ActionID** | uint16 | all |  |  | M |
| 1 | **InvokeID** | uint32 | all |  |  | O |

> This command triggers an action (state change) on the involved endpoints, in a "fire and forget" manner. Afterwards, the action’s state SHALL be Inactive.
>
> Example: recall a scene on a number of lights.

#### InstantActionWithTransition Command

> This command SHALL have the following data fields:

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|

| 1 | **InvokeID** | uint32 | all |  |  | O |
| 2 | **Transition­ Time** | uint16 | all |  | MS | M |

> It is recommended that, where possible (e.g., it is not possible for attributes with Boolean data type), a gradual transition SHOULD take place from the old to the new state over this time period. How­ ever, the exact transition is manufacturer dependent.
>
> This command triggers an action (state change) on the involved endpoints, with a specified time to transition from the current state to the new state. During the transition, the action’s state SHALL be Active. Afterwards, the action’s state SHALL be Inactive.
>
> Example: recall a scene on a number of lights, with a specified transition time.
>
> **TransitionTime Field**
>
> This field SHALL indicate the transition time in 1/10th of seconds.

| 1 | **InvokeID** | uint32 | all |  |  | O |

> This command triggers the commencement of an action on the involved endpoints. Afterwards, the action’s state SHALL be Active.
>
> Example: start a dynamic lighting pattern (such as gradually rotating the colors around the set­ points of the scene) on a set of lights.
>
> Example: start a sequence of events such as a wake-up experience involving lights moving through several brightness/color combinations and the window covering gradually opening.

| 1 | **InvokeID** | uint32 | all |  |  | O |
| 2 | **Duration** | uint32 | all |  | MS | M |

> This command triggers the commencement of an action on the involved endpoints, and SHALL change the action’s state to Active. After the specified Duration, the action will stop, and the action’s state SHALL change to Inactive.
>
> Example: start a dynamic lighting pattern (such as gradually rotating the colors around the set­ points of the scene) on a set of lights for 1 hour (Duration=3600).
>
> **Duration Field**
>
> This field SHALL indicate the requested duration in seconds.

#### StopAction Command

> This command SHALL have the following data fields:

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **ActionID** | uint16 | all |  |  | M |
| 1 | **InvokeID** | uint32 | all |  |  | O |

> This command pauses an ongoing action, and SHALL change the action’s state to Paused.
>
> Example: pause a dynamic lighting effect (the lights stay at their current color) which was previ­ ously started with StartAction.

#### PauseActionWithDuration Command

> This command SHALL have the following data fields:

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |

> This command pauses an ongoing action, and SHALL change the action’s state to Paused. After the specified Duration, the ongoing action will be automatically resumed. which SHALL change the action’s state to Active.
>
> Example: pause a dynamic lighting effect (the lights stay at their current color) for 10 minutes (Duration=600).
>
> The difference between Pause/Resume and Disable/Enable is on the one hand semantic (the former is more of a transitionary nature while the latter is more permanent) and on the other hand these can be implemented slightly differently in the implementation of the action (e.g. a Pause would be automatically resumed after some hours or during a nightly reset, while an Disable would remain in effect until explicitly enabled again).
>
> **Duration Field**
>
> This field SHALL indicate the requested duration in seconds.

#### ResumeAction Command

> This command SHALL have the following data fields:

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **ActionID** | uint16 | all |  |  | M |
| 1 | **InvokeID** | uint32 | all |  |  | O |

> This command resumes a previously paused action, and SHALL change the action’s state to Active.
>
> The difference between ResumeAction and StartAction is that ResumeAction will continue the action from the state where it was paused, while StartAction will start the action from the begin­ ning.
>
> Example: resume a dynamic lighting effect (the lights' colors will change gradually, continuing from the point they were paused).

#### EnableAction Command

> This command SHALL have the following data fields:

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **ActionID** | uint16 | all |  |  | M |
| 1 | **InvokeID** | uint32 | all |  |  | O |

> This command enables a certain action or automation. Afterwards, the action’s state SHALL be Active.
>
> Example: enable a motion sensor to control the lights in an area.

#### EnableActionWithDuration Command

> This command SHALL have the following data fields:

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **ActionID** | uint16 | all |  |  | M |
| 1 | **InvokeID** | uint32 | all |  |  | O |
| 2 | **Duration** | uint32 | all |  | MS | M |

> This command enables a certain action or automation, and SHALL change the action’s state to be Active. After the specified Duration, the action or automation will stop, and the action’s state SHALL change to Disabled.
>
> Example: enable a "presence mimicking" behavior for the lights in your home during a vacation; the Duration field is used to indicated the length of your absence from home. After that period, the presence mimicking behavior will no longer control these lights.
>
> **Duration Field**
>
> This field SHALL indicate the requested duration in seconds.

#### DisableAction Command

> This command SHALL have the following data fields:

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **ActionID** | uint16 | all |  |  | M |
| 1 | **InvokeID** | uint32 | all |  |  | O |

> This command disables a certain action or automation, and SHALL change the action’s state to Inac­ tive.
>
> Example: disable a motion sensor to no longer control the lights in an area.

#### DisableActionWithDuration Command

> This command SHALL have the following data fields:

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **ActionID** | uint16 | all |  |  | M |
| 1 | **InvokeID** | uint32 | all |  |  | O |
| 2 | **Duration** | uint32 | all |  | MS | M |

> This command disables a certain action or automation, and SHALL change the action’s state to Dis­ abled. After the specified Duration, the action or automation will re-start, and the action’s state SHALL change to either Inactive or Active, depending on the actions (see [examples](#example-4-wake-up-routine) 4 and 6).
>
> Example: disable a "wakeup" experience for a period of 1 week when going on holiday (to prevent them from turning on in the morning while you’re not at home). After this period, the wakeup experience will control the lights as before.
>
> **Duration Field**
>
> This field SHALL indicate the requested duration in seconds.

### Events

> This cluster SHALL support these events:

| **ID** | **Name**         | **Priority** | **Access** | **Conformance** |
|--------|------------------|--------------|------------|-----------------|
| 0x00   | **StateChanged** | INFO         | V          | M               |
| 0x01   | **ActionFailed** | INFO         | V          | M               |

#### StateChanged Event

> This event SHALL be generated when there is a change in the State of an ActionID during the execu­ tion of an action *and* the most recent command using that ActionID used an InvokeID data field.
>
> It provides feedback to the client about the progress of the action.
>
> *Example*: When InstantActionWithTransition is invoked (with an InvokeID data field), two State­ Changed events will be generated:

- one when the transition starts (NewState=Active)

- one when the transition completed (NewState=Inactive)

> This event SHALL have the following data fields:

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **ActionID** | uint16 |  |  |  | M |
| 1 | **InvokeID** | uint32 |  |  |  | M |
| 2 | **NewState** | [ActionSta­](#actionstateenum-type) [teEnum](#actionstateenum-type) |  |  |  | M |

> **ActionID Field**
>
> This field SHALL be set to the ActionID of the action which has changed state.
>
> **InvokeID Field**
>
> This field SHALL be set to the InvokeID which was provided to the most recent command referenc­ ing this ActionID.
>
> **NewState Field**
>
> This field SHALL be set to state that the action has changed to.

#### ActionFailed Event

> This event SHALL be generated when there is some error which prevents the action from its nor­ mal planned execution *and* the most recent command using that ActionID used an InvokeID data field.
>
> It provides feedback to the client about the non-successful progress of the action.
>
> *Example*: When InstantActionWithTransition is invoked (with an InvokeID data field), and another controller changes the state of one or more of the involved endpoints during the transition, thus interrupting the transition triggered by the action, two events would be generated:

- StateChanged when the transition starts (NewState=Active)

- ActionFailed when the interrupting command occurs (NewState=Inactive, Error=interrupted)

> *Example*: When InstantActionWithTransition is invoked (with an InvokeID data field = 1), and the same client invokes an InstantAction with (the same or another ActionId and) InvokeID = 2, and this second command interrupts the transition triggered by the first command, these events would be generated:

- StateChanged (InvokeID=1, NewState=Active) when the transition starts

&nbsp;

- ActionFailed (InvokeID=2, NewState=Inactive, Error=interrupted) when the second command interrupts the transition

- StateChanged (InvokeID=2, NewState=Inactive) upon the execution of the action for the second command

> This event SHALL have the following data fields:

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |

### Examples

> This section provides some examples how the attributes and commands in this cluster can be used in practical situations. Details of the behavior typically depend on the details of the logic built into the server.

#### Example 1: Scene recall

> User has defined a scene on a number of lights. The corresponding action would have these data fields describing it:

- Name="sunset"

- Type=Scene

- EndpointListID references a struct referencing the set of involved endpoints

  - Name="living room"

  - Type=Room

  - Endpoints=list of the endpoints of the lights in this room

&nbsp;

- SupportedCommands: InstantAction, InstantActionWithTransition

> The InstantAction command (e.g. triggered by a voice command "set sunset in living room") will trigger the server to activate that scene on those lights.
>
> When a slow fade-in is preferred, the InstantActionWithTransition can be used, with a Transition­ Time parameter of e.g. 50 (denoting 5 s).

![](media/image76.png)

> *Figure 55. State diagram for example 'scene recall'*

#### Example 2: Set dynamic light effect

> User has defined a scene on a number of lights. The corresponding action would have these data fields describing it:

- Name="sunset"

- Type=Scene

- EndpointListID references a struct referencing the set of involved endpoints (same as in Exam­ ple 1)

- SupportedCommands: StartAction, StartActionWithDuration, StopAction

> The StartActionWithDuration command (e.g. triggered by a voice command "play sunset in living room for 1 hour") will trigger the server to activate a dynamic pattern with colors inspired by sun­ set on the associated lights. At any time, the StopAction can be used to stop the effect.
>
> Please note that the most of the data fields in the ActionStruct for this example are identical to those in example 1 - except for the SupportedCommands. The different sets of supported commands indicate whether it is an instant scene recall (example 1) vs. a long-term dynamic effort (example 2). A server could expose this action also as a single action with the combined set of supported com­ mands.
>
> ![](media/image77.png)
>
> *Figure 56. State diagram for example 'dynamic light effect'*

#### Example 3: Pause sensor automation

> User has defined an automation: a motion sensor controls the lights in a certain room. Sometimes, they want to override that automatic behavior, e.g. when having a party.
>
> The action for this example would refer to such automation, which is typically active, but can be paused (=temporarily disabled).
>
> The corresponding action would have these data fields describing it:

- Name="motion sensor"

- Type=Automation

- EndpointListID references a struct referencing the set of involved endpoints (same as in Exam­ ple 1)

- SupportedCommands: EnableAction, DisableAction, PauseAction, PauseActionWithDuration, ResumeAction

> Typically, the action has been started when the user defines the motion sensor behavior, so without a Matter command the action’s state would be 'Active'. The PauseActionWithDuration command (e.g. triggered by a voice command "disable the motion sensor in living room for 2 hours") will trig­ ger the server to disable the behavior associated with the motion sensor for the specified time. A ResumeAction command would make this behavior active again. The automation could also have internal logic to abort the disabling after several hours or during the night-time reset, to accommo­ date for the case the user 'paused' and forgot to 'resume'.
>
> ![](media/image78.png)
>
> *Figure 57. State diagram for example 'pause sensor automation'*

#### Example 4: Wake-up routine

> User has defined a wake-up routine: the lights in the bedroom will gradually become brighter and change in color temperature to simulate a sunrise. The sequence lasts for e.g. 30 minutes. Near the end of the sequence, the window coverings would be (partially) opened as well.
>
> The corresponding action would have these data fields describing it:

- Name="wakeup"

- Type=Sequence

- EndpointListID references a struct referencing the set of involved endpoints (lights and window coverings in the bedroom)

- SupportedCommands: EnableAction, DisableAction, DisableActionWithDuration, PauseAction, PauseActionWithDuration

> When the user wants to snooze some more, he can use a voice command to trigger the PauseAction command (which could automatically timeout after e.g. 10 minutes). The StopAction command could similarly be used to cancel the remainder of the whole sequence. The DisableActionWithDu­ ration (with parameter 172,800 =2\*24\*60\*60 s) can be used on Friday evening to disable the sequence for the weekend.
>
> When such action has been defined, a Matter node which is aware of the user’s calendar for the day, can use the StartAction command to trigger this sequence of events.
>
> ![](media/image79.jpeg)
>
> *Figure 58. State diagram for example 'wake-up experience'*

#### Example 5: Scheduled scene recall

> User has setup a scene to be recalled at a certain time of day (e.g. colorful garden lighting to switch on around sunset) and switching off those lights (e.g. at midnight). The server’s automation system takes care of this. On certain occasions (e.g. garden party), the user wants to override this behavior (i.e. the scene should not be recalled at sunset because another scene has been set for the party).
>
> The corresponding action would have these data fields describing it:

- Name="colorful evening garden"

- Type=Automation

- EndpointListID references a struct referencing the set of involved endpoints (lights in the gar­ den)

- SupportedCommands: EnableAction, DisableAction, DisableActionWithDuration

> After installation, this action is in Inactive state. At the scheduled "on" time, the colorful garden lighting scene is activated and the action’s state changes to the Active state. At the scheduled "off" time, the lights are switched off, and the action’s state changes to the Inactive state. Using the Dis­ ableAction, the user can prevent these automated steps to occur - the action’s state changes to the Disabled state. Using the DisableActionWithDuration, the user can do similarly, but also indicate an automatic re-enabling after the specified time period. Using the EnableAction, the user can re- enable the automation.

>
> *Figure 59. State diagram for example 'scheduled scene recall'*

#### Example 6: Alarm system

> User has an alarm system which exposes this cluster, with an action that allows to arm/disarm the system by voice commands from a Matter node which is a client to this cluster.
>
> The corresponding action would have these data fields describing it:

- Name="alarm system"

- Type=Automation

- EndpointListID references a struct referencing the set of involved endpoints (elements of the alarm system)

- SupportedCommands: EnableAction, DisableAction, DisableActionWithDuration

> After installation, this action could be in Inactive state (assume user is at home installing so system is not armed). Using the EnableAction, the alarm system would be armed. Using the DisableAction, the alarm system would be disarmed (or disarmed for a period with DisableWithDuration).

## Proxy Architecture

> **NOTE** Proxy Architecture, Proxy clusters, and Proxy support, are provisional.

### Motivation

> Constrained devices might not support more than a handful of subscriptions. This is usually attrib­ utable to a limited memory or battery. However, there might be a large number of clients who desire to subscribe to that device.

### Subscription Proxy: Overview

> A subscription proxy is a type of Node that is capable of multiplexing subscriptions from multiple subscribers onto a single subscription to a given publisher.
>
> The term 'proxy' is a convenient shorthand that refers to this type of Node.
>
> The term 'source' SHALL refer to a node that serves as the original source of truth for a set of data. The source acts as a publisher of that data.
>
> The term 'client' SHALL refer to a node that wants to subscribe to some source.
>
> A proxy subscribing to a source SHALL surface an identical 'mirror' of the source’s data to down­ stream clients without the clients having to alter their interaction regardless of whether they are interacting with a proxy or the source itself.
>
> The proxy SHALL be identified by the Subscription Proxy Device Type.
>
> ![](media/image82.jpeg)
>
> *Figure 61. Digital twin acting as a proxy re-publishing clusters*
>
> This multiplexing of subscriptions allows the source to delegate all subscriptions to its proxy, only needing to support a single subscription from that proxy. This reduces the demands placed on energy and memory resources. Consequently, that single subscription will encompass the union of all client interest sets. If the combined set of attribute/event paths becomes fairly large, proxies can leverage the use of wildcards to merge multiple localized paths into a single, broader path with wildcards.

![](media/image83.jpeg)

> *Figure 62. Proxy multiplexing interest sets from 3 distinct clients*
>
> A proxy SHALL only proxy subscribe interactions. It SHALL NOT proxy any other type of interac­ tion.

### Composition & Paths

> A client subscribing to a proxy SHALL specify the Node ID of the source it wishes to subscribe to in the [Path](#path). This SHALL be different from the logical destination Node ID of the message, which
>
> SHALL be the Node ID of the proxy.

![](media/image84.png)

> *Figure 63. Sample paths when subscribing to a proxy vs the source*

### Proxy Subscriptions

#### Overview

> A proxy only attempts to subscribe to a source when there is a current, valid subscription from a client to the proxy for that source’s data.
>
> The term 'upstream subscription' refers to the subscription from the proxy either directly to the source, or indirectly to another proxy for that source’s data.
>
> The term 'downstream subscription' refers to the subscription from either a client or another proxy to the proxy in question.
>
> Consequently, when that 'downstream' subscription disappears, the 'upstream' subscription will either be torn down (if there are no other clients interested in that source) or be amended.
>
> This does not require a priori knowledge of a client’s interest set.

#### Upstream/Downstream Subscription Mechanics

> Upstream and downstream subscriptions have the following properties:

- Both subscriptions are independent, but weakly linked.

  - Data is received on the client side, stored on the server side, and used to generate a different set of reports to downstream client(s).

- It is data that is being proxied, not the actual subscription messages themselves.

- The termination of a downstream subscription will automatically result in an amendment of the upstream subscription to remove the relevant paths that were in the downstream, with a

> complete termination of the upstream subscription if there was only 1 downstream subscriber present.

- The disappearance of an upstream subscription will not automatically cancel the downstream subscription.

  - Upstream subscriptions MAY disappear due to network connectivity issues. If an upstream sync report is not received, the proxy SHALL attempt once to re-subscribe to the upstream source; if that re-subscription attempt fails, the proxy SHALL terminate any associated downstream subscriptions.

  - If an upstream subscription is positively terminated by the source as a whole, that will result in a similar termination of the downstream subscription.

- In addition to forwarding status codes embedded in the ReportData from the source, the proxy will convey a special 'NO_UPSTREAM_SUBSCRIPTION' IM status code to the downstream client if it has not established a subscription to the source.

> The diagram below gives a sample sequence show-casing the two subscriptions:

![](media/image85.jpeg)

> *Figure 64. Upstream/Downstream subscription sequences*

#### Sync/Liveness

> Since subscriptions provide a 'sync' message to infer health of the subscription on both sides, it allows a client to monitor the health of its source peer.
>
> Conveyance of this is preserved in downstream subscription through the 'NO_UPSTREAM_SUB­ SCRIPTION' status code. This conveys effectively the same information as the sync message would had the client directly subscribed to the source.

#### Upstream Subscription Parameter Derivation

> Since the proxy multiplexes all downstream subscriptions onto a single upstream subscription, it has to have logic to harmonize the various parameters from each client subscription.
>
> The following logic table describes what the proxy SHOULD do:

| **Parameter** | **Suggested Logic** |
|----|----|
| Attribute/EventPaths | UNION of all paths. Proxy MAY use wildcards if needed to simplify this logic. |
| DataVersionList | MIN |
| EventNumberList | MIN |
| MinimumSyncInterval | MIN |
| MaximumSyncInterval | MAX |
| MinimumReportingIntervalList | MIN |
| ReportableChangeList | MIN |

> Since each client’s interest is different from the final multiplexed subscription, the proxy has to appropriately filter the data being received from the source before sending it to a given client.

### Schemas and Data Serialization/Deserialization

> Unlike clients that need to semantically interpret data in addition to deserializing/serializing to/from its internal data stores, a proxy only needs to do the latter.
>
> As a result, proxies MAY achieve proxy functionality with a single firmware image built to handle any client, any cluster, any type of device.

### Indirect Proxies

> A proxy MAY subscribe to another proxy instead of subscribing directly to the source. This creates proxy chains that allow a single source to be proxied by multiple proxies, allowing better use of available proxy capacity.

### Proxy Discovery & Assignment Flow

> The following flow describes the process by which a client:

- Discovers that a source needs a proxy

- Finds an appropriate proxy on the network that is able to handle its request

- Sets up the proxy to subscribe to the source

#### Step 0: Proxy Setup

> A device indicates its ability to act as a certified proxy through stating support for the Subscription Proxy device type.
>
> When such a device is commissioned, the commissioner SHALL recognize this ability and MAY write the NodeIds of all the sources that need proxying into the [Proxy Configuration Cluster](#proxy-configuration-cluster) on the proxy device. Alternatively, it MAY configure the proxy to wildcard proxy all devices, removing the need to specify a particular set of NodeIds.
>
> Additionally, the commissioner MAY write the Node ID of the newly added proxy to the [Valid Prox­](#valid-proxies-cluster) [ies Cluster](#valid-proxies-cluster) on source devices that needs proxying. This cluster stores the static list of candidate proxies for a given device. Only devices that support the cluster would need to have this configura­ tion written.

#### Step 1: Rejection

> There unfortunately isn’t any a priori heuristic that MAY be applied to deduce if a source needs proxying. This is usually a function of the number of clients subscribed to a source, the number of paths in those subscriptions, as well as the sync intervals.
>
> When a source cannot handle any more incremental subscriptions, that is when proxying is needed. This is discovered when a client tries to subscribe to the source and is sent back a StatusRe­ sponse containing a RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED IM status code, indicating the source’s inability to handle further subscriptions:

![](media/image86.jpeg)

> *Figure 65. Rejection*
>
> In the diagram above, the constraints of the source have been simplified down to having 3 available subscription slots that get filled up.
>
> Upon receipt of the RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED error, the client SHALL invoke the [Get Valid Proxies Request](#_bookmark1084) command on the source Node. In response, it SHALL receive a [Get Valid Proxies Response](#_bookmark1085) message containing the NodeIds of valid, candidate proxies.

#### Step 2: Proxy Discovery

> After the client has received the list of possible valid proxies, the client MAY attempt to discover a valid proxy that is able to proxy its request.
>
> To do so, the client sends out a [Proxy Discover Request Command](#_bookmark1077) as a groupcast message to the [All](#_bookmark114)
>
> [Proxies](#_bookmark114) universal group. Before it transmits this message, the client SHALL momentarily subscribe to the IPv6 address that maps to the [All Proxies](#_bookmark114) universal group to appropriately receive all responses.

![](media/image87.jpeg)

> *Figure 66. Discovery Request*

#### Step 3: Proxy Response

> Proxies respond to the request with a [Proxy Discover Response Command](#_bookmark1078) sent as a groupcast message to the [All Proxies](#_bookmark114) universal group. A proxy SHALL only send this message when it can handle the subscription request, regardless of whether it is currently subscribed to the source. The response will contain metadata about its ability to handle the subscription.
>
> The [Proxy Discover Response Command](#_bookmark1078) SHALL be sent as a completely separate, un-related transac­ tion to the original request. The client SHALL correlate the two using the SourceNodeId present in both messages.
>
> Proxies SHALL stagger their responses by waiting for a random interval between 0 and *PROXY_S­ CAN_RESPONSE_JITTER* before sending the [Proxy Discover Response Command](#_bookmark1078) to prevent overwhelm­ ing the network or the client, which can be constrained and can have limited buffers.
>
> ![](media/image88.jpeg)
>
> *Figure 67. Proxies send back responses*

#### Step 4: Proxy Selection

> Client SHALL wait for *PROXY_SCAN_PERIOD* to aggregate all responses and SHALL filter the set of responses received. Specifically, the client SHALL discard:

- Responses containing a Source Node ID for other unintended sources

- Responses containing a Source Node ID in the message that does not match any in the [Valid­](#_bookmark1083) [ProxyList](#_bookmark1083).

> It SHALL then select a proxy from this filtered set based on implementation-chosen policies. One suggested approach would involve selecting the proxy with the least number of hops to the source, followed by largest available capacity.
>
> Clients MAY unsubscribe from the IPv6 multicast group that maps to the [All Proxies](#_bookmark114) universal group after aggregating the responses.
>
> ![](media/image89.jpeg)
>
> *Figure 68. Selecting a Proxy*

#### Step 5: Proxy Subscription

> The client then subscribes to the proxy it has selected. The proxy will do one of two things:
>
> **Option 1:** If there isn’t another proxy already subscribed to the source, the proxy subscribes to the
>
> source directly:
>
> ![](media/image90.jpeg)
>
> *Figure 69. Primary proxy subscription*
>
> **Option 2:** If there is already another proxy subscribed to that source, the selected proxy subscribes to that proxy instead.

![](media/image91.jpeg)

> *Figure 70. Primary proxy subscription*
>
> It doesn’t attempt to subscribe directly to the source since it does not know if the source has any free slots available to support the subscription, risking a potential subscription failure if it did so.
>
> Proxies MAY select between the two options by 'sniffing' the \`[Proxy Discover Response Command](#_bookmark1078) mes­ sages that were emitted by other proxies. This allows the candidate proxy to determine whether there is another proxy already subscribed to the source.
>
> A proxy SHALL have only one subscription to a given source regardless of the number of subscrip­ tion requests from clients for that source. This is necessary to ensure timely ACL enforcement in the case where a client no longer has access to the source, and subsequent state changes will not be made available to that client (see [ACL Enforcement](#acl-enforcement) for more details).

#### Step 6: Eviction

> At this point, the source might not be able to handle another subscription. If so, it SHALL evict non- proxy subscriptions to make space for the proxy subscription. This is acceptable since those clients that got evicted MAY eventually subscribe to a proxy as well.
>
> To make this possible, proxies have to express the type of subscription (proxy or not proxy) in the
>
> SubscribeRequest itself.

![](media/image92.jpeg)

> *Figure 71. C3 gets evicted*

#### Step 7: Re-Assignment

> The evicted clients undergo the same proxy discovery/selection process, and eventually settle on a set of proxies.
>
> ![](media/image93.jpeg)
>
> *Figure 72. C3 gets reassigned to P1*

#### Notable Characteristics

> This algorithm has the following notable characteristics:

- The system 'auto-balances' based on the needs of clients and the capabilities of the source

- No persistent state or a priori configuration is needed on any node

- No a priori heuristics are needed to figure out if a node *should* be proxied.

- Robust to proxy failure by leveraging the liveness construct of subscriptions to accelerate dis­ covery

- No centralized proxy management/assignment service is needed.

  - There is no single point of failure. No need for an election, state backup, or fail-over.

- Low complexity on server (which are usually the more constrained device), slightly more on the client

### Constraints

#### Eviction Rules

> A source SHALL NOT evict an existing proxy already subscribed to it to make way for a new sub­ scription regardless of whether that new subscription emanates from a proxy or not. This prevents instability in the system since it might result in ping-ponging proxies subscribing to that source.

#### Number of Direct Proxies

> There SHOULD only be one proxy node directly subscribed to a source in a single-fabric setting. This is not enforced by the source but rather, by proxies themselves.

#### Multi-Fabric

> In a multi-fabric setting, a source node MAY be subscribed to by clients commissioned into different fabrics. It is highly desirable that a single proxy interacting with a source support clients from mul­ tiple fabrics. To make this possible, a proxy SHOULD when possible, be commissioned into all fab­ rics that contain sources that need proxying.
>
> If a proxy is not commissioned into all fabrics, it might not see another proxy’s [Proxy Discover](#_bookmark1078) [Response Command](#_bookmark1078) messages, nor will it be capable of directly subscribing to that proxy even if it did, since it doesn’t have credentials to do so. This MAY result in multiple proxies attempting to sub­ scribe directly to the source, resulting in potential rejection by the source and consequently, an inability for a client’s subscription to be served indirectly through that chosen proxy. This might be unpredictable depending on which proxy was able to subscribe first to that source.

### Certification

> To ensure a consistent expectation of behavior from a proxy device, the proxy SHOULD be certified by the Connectivity Standards Alliance against the expectations of a proxy. Once certified, it MAY claim compatibility against the Subscription Proxy device type.

### Security & Privacy

#### Authentication

> To prevent malicious or unattested devices from acting as proxies to clients, the [Valid Proxies Clus­](#valid-proxies-cluster) [ter](#valid-proxies-cluster) provides a scheme for admins to specify the NodeIds of valid, attested proxies to the source itself, which is in turn conveyed to clients. This allows for filtering of the ensuing [Proxy Discover](#_bookmark1078) [Response Command](#_bookmark1078) messages to only select valid, trusted proxies.

#### Multicast Messages

> The proxy discovery commands SHALL be encrypted with a fabric-provided group key. An Admin­ istrator that wishes to enable proxy functionality on a set of clients SHALL bind the [All Proxies](#_bookmark114) group to a specific group key in the Group Key Management cluster.
>
> Consequently, a [Proxy Discover Request Command](#_bookmark1077) message SHALL be sent for every [All Proxies](#_bookmark114)
>
> GroupID instance specified in the Group Keys Management cluster.

#### ACL Enforcement

> Administrators SHOULD configure source nodes to grant the 'Proxy View' privilege to proxy clients. If this privilege is not granted for at least the Access Control cluster, the proxy will not function. This privilege SHOULD be granted for the entire source node for a proxy to be most effective, since neither the proxy nor the Administrator can predict which source clusters may be subscribed by other clients.
>
> The proxy SHALL subscribe to the Access Control Cluster on the source and SHALL enforce the source’s ACLs *on behalf of* the source when serving its downstream client subscriptions.
>
> The proxy MAY enforce the source’s ACLs eagerly (i.e. at first ACL change), lazily (i.e. at next data report), or by some combination of these approaches. The key guarantee is that the proxy SHALL apply the latest source ACLs from its upstream subscription at the time it generates associated downstream subscription reports.
>
> The proxy SHALL enforce the source’s ACLs on a path by path basis, in a similar manner to how the [Access Control Privilege Granting algorithm](#conceptual-access-control-privilege-granting-algorithm) enforces access. Downstream subscription paths that are not granted access by the proxy SHALL cause the proxy to generate an UNSUPPORTED_ACCESS error for that subscription path.
>
> If all report data paths in a downstream subscription result in UNSUPPORTED_ACCESS error, the proxy SHALL tear down that downstream subscription.
>
> If the proxy is not able to view the source’s Access Control Cluster due to insufficient privileges, it SHALL NOT generate any downstream subscription data reports for that source. Instead, the proxy SHALL generate a report containing UNSUPPORTED_ACCESS errors for each path in the downstream subscription and tear down the downstream subscription.

## Intermittently Connected Devices Behavior

### ICD Server Behavior

#### Operational States

1.  **Idle Mode**

> **Idle Mode** defines the operational state of an ICD where the node is unreachable due to it not being able to receive messages for a certain period of time. The ICD will remain in Idle Mode for a maxi­ mum of one [Idle Mode Duration](#idlemodeduration-attribute) as defined in the [ICD Management cluster](#icd-management-cluster).

#### Slow Polling

> When in **Idle Mode**, the ICD SHALL configure its network interface in *Slow Polling*. *Slow Polling* defines the fastest frequency at which the device will typically receive messages in Idle Mode. The [*Slow Polling*](#slow-polling) interval MAY be the same as the [Idle Mode Duration](#idlemodeduration-attribute).

2.  **Active Mode**

> **Active Mode** defines the operational state of an ICD where it is reachable on the network and will answer in a timely manner. The minimum amount of time a device will typically remain in Active Mode is [Active Mode Duration](#activemodeduration-attribute) as defined in the [ICD Management cluster](#icd-management-cluster).

#### Fast Polling

> When in **Active Mode**, the ICD SHALL configure its network interface in *Fast Polling*. *Fast Polling*
>
> defines the fastest frequency at which the device can receive messages in Active Mode.

3.  **Operational State Switch**

> Some of the reasons why an ICD can switch Operational states from Idle Mode to Active Mode are:

- The ICD has remained in Idle Mode for a full [Idle Mode Duration](#idlemodeduration-attribute).

- An attribute change needs to be reported to a subscriber.

- When the maximum reporting interval has been reached for an active subscription.

- A generated event needs to be reported to a subscriber.

> When an ICD switches from Idle Mode to Active Mode, it MAY send all pending messages. These messages could be:

- Sending subscription reports and events.

- Sending Check-In messages.

- Sending Interaction Messages.

> A node typically determines whether it is in Active or Idle mode based on whether it has any out­ standing [Exchanges](#message-exchanges-1) in the Message Layer. While there are Exchanges active, a node typically will remain in Active mode. Once all Exchanges are closed and the node has no other outstanding rea­ sons for staying active, a node SHOULD transition into Idle mode. An ICD node MAY use additional modes and logic for switching between them.

#### ICD Session Configurations

> Due to the ICD operating modes, there may be an additional delay before the ICD receives a mes­ sage. This causes the travel time of a message to be affected by the ICD’s configuration and current operating mode.
>
> When in [Idle Mode](#_bookmark1088), the device will typically not receive messages at a faster frequency than the [Slow Polling Interval](#slow-polling). As such, a client SHOULD NOT try to send the same message at a frequency higher than the [Slow Polling Interval](#slow-polling) when the ICD is in Idle Mode. The ICD SHALL set its [SES­](#_bookmark343) [SION_IDLE_INTERVAL](#_bookmark343) to a value greater than or equal to the [Slow Polling Interval](#slow-polling).
>
> When in [Active Mode](#_bookmark1090), the device will typically not receive messages at a faster frequency than the [Fast Polling Interval](#fast-polling). As such, a client SHOULD NOT try to send the same message at a frequency higher than the [Fast Polling Interval](#fast-polling) when the ICD is in Active Mode. The ICD SHALL set its [SES­](#_bookmark343) [SION_ACTIVE_INTERVAL](#_bookmark343) to a value greater than or equal to the [Fast Polling Interval](#fast-polling).
>
> The ICD SHALL set its [SESSION_ACTIVE_THRESHOLD](#_bookmark343) to the [Active Mode Threshold](#activemodethreshold-attribute) stored in the [ICD Management cluster](#icd-management-cluster).

#### Check-In Protocol Support

> This section describes the Check-In Protocol use case used by Intermittently Connected Devices (ICDs) to maintain a known relationship in case subscriptions with clients are lost. This includes how a client shares a Check-In token (symmetric key) with the ICD, when Check-In messages are sent and how the Check-In Protocol requirements are respected.
>
> The Check-In Protocol is a fail-safe mechanism which allows an Intermittently Connected Device (ICD) to notify a registered client that it is available for communication when all subscriptions between the client and ICD are lost. A subscription can be lost for several reasons, such as:

- The ICD might not have full RAM retention when it is in an idle state.

- When the ICD is powered off to change the battery.

- Power or network outage causing the connection between the client and the ICD to be inter­ rupted.

- The client is unavailable for any reason (e.g. during a software update or hosted on a mobile device that is sometimes out-of-home).

> The Check-In message is sessionless and relies on a shared secret that has been given to the ICD during the registration of the client using the [ICD Management cluster](#icd-management-cluster).

1.  **Use Case Requirements**

> The ICD Check-In Protocol representation of the [Check-In Counter](#check-in-counter) SHALL be the [ICD Counter](#icdcounter-attribute). It SHALL follow all the requirements of the [Check-In Counter](#check-in-counter).
>
> The ICD Check-In Protocol representation of the Check-In Protocol [persistent data store](#_bookmark451) SHALL be the [RegisteredClients](#registeredclients-attribute) attribute in the [ICD Management cluster](#icd-management-cluster). The attribute SHALL store all the [client registration information](#monitoringregistrationstruct-type).
>
> The [Application Data](#_bookmark454) for the ICD Check-In Protocol use case SHALL be the [Active Mode Threshold](#activemodethreshold-attribute) attribute in the [ICD Management cluster](#icd-management-cluster). Before being used in the [encryption process](#encryption-procedure), the [Active](#activemodethreshold-attribute) [Mode Threshold](#activemodethreshold-attribute) SHALL be converted into a 2-byte little-endian value.

2.  **Protocol State Machine**

> The state machine diagram represents the states an ICD can be in. The diagram represents the state of the ICD for one client or [MonitoredSubject](#_bookmark1135). The ICD can be in a different state for each client simultaneously.
>
> ![](media/image94.jpeg)
>
> *Figure 73. ICD State Machine*

#### Uncommissioned State

> An ICD is in the *Uncommissioned* state when it has not been provided with any credentials to join a fabric. In this state, the ICD is passively waiting for incoming messages during the [open commis­](#open-commissioning-window) [sioning window](#open-commissioning-window).

#### Unregistered State

> An ICD is in the *Unregistered* state with a given [MonitoredSubject](#_bookmark1135) when no established relationship with the client exists, meaning the ICD has neither a registration entry in the [ICD Management clus­](#icd-management-cluster) [ter](#icd-management-cluster) nor an active subscription associated with the client. In this state, the ICD is passively waiting for incoming messages during its [Active Mode Duration](#activemodeduration-attribute).

#### Check-in State

> An ICD is in the *Check-in* state when a registration entry is present for the client in the [ICD Manage­](#icd-management-cluster) [ment cluster](#icd-management-cluster), but no active subscription exists for that client. In this state, the ICD sends Check-In messages instead of subscription reports/events. The Check-In message notifies the client that the ICD is available for communication.
>
> When in the Check-in state, each time an ICD transitions from [Idle Mode](#_bookmark1088) to [Active Mode](#_bookmark1090), the ICD SHALL attempt to send a Check-In message to each registered ([MonitoredSubject](#_bookmark1135)) client that are [resident](#clienttype-field) clients without an active subscription, effectively attempting to send a Check-In message every [Idle Mode Duration](#idlemodeduration-attribute). The ICD SHOULD NOT attempt to send Check-In messages to clients that have been registered as [ephemeral](#clienttype-field) clients.
>
> The ICD MAY back-off (i.e. skip some of these Check-In messages) when it does not experience inter­ actions from the registered client (e.g. if that client has left the home network) after several consec­ utive Check-In messages. The time between Check-In messages SHALL NOT be larger than the dura­
>
> tion (in seconds) specified in [MaximumCheckInBackoff](#maximumcheckinbackoff-attribute). The number of consecutive missed Check- In messages required to start backing-off is manufacturer specific. The missed Check-In message counters SHALL be reset to 0 for all registered clients when a [user active mode trigger](#user-active-mode-trigger) is executed.

#### Subscribed State

> An ICD is in the *Subscribed* state with a given [MonitoredSubject](#_bookmark1135) when it has at least one active sub­ scription with the client. It is not necessary to have an entry in the [ICD Management cluster](#icd-management-cluster) to be in the subscribed state. The ICD MAY be in the subscribed state most of its operating time. In this state, the ICD’s goal is to notify the client when it is available for communication with subscription reports.

3.  **Message Format**

> All Check-In messages SHALL be structured as specified in [Message Format](#message-frame-format). All Check-In messages are unsecured at the message layer:

- The [Session ID](#session-id-16-bits) field SHALL be set to 0.

- The [Session Type](#_bookmark230) bits of the [Security Flags](#security-flags-8-bits) SHALL be set to 0.

- The [S Flag](#_bookmark223) field of the [Message Flags](#message-flags-8-bits) SHALL be set to 0.

- The [Message Counter](#message-counter-32-bits) value SHALL be the current value of the [global unencrypted message](#global-unencrypted-message-counter) [counter](#global-unencrypted-message-counter).

- The [DSIZ](#_bookmark224) field of the [Message Flags](#message-flags-8-bits) SHALL be set to 0.

#### Protocol Header Field

> The Check-In message will have the following values for the protocol header field :

- The [Initiator flag](#_bookmark240) field SHALL be set to 1.

- The [Reliability flag](#_bookmark242) field SHALL be set to 0.

- The [SX flag](#_bookmark243) field SHALL be set to 0.

- The [Vendor Flag](#_bookmark244) field SHALL be set to 0.

#### Protocol Id and Opcode

> The ICD Check-In message SHALL have [secure channel](#_bookmark249) protocol ID. The ICD Check-In message SHALL have the [ICD Check-In message](#_bookmark308) protocol opcode.

4.  **Sending Check-In Message Steps**

> When sending an ICD Check-In message, the server SHALL respect the following requirements:

1.  The server SHALL NOT send more than one Check-In message with a given [ICD counter value](#icdcounter-attribute) to the same [RegisteredClient](#registeredclients-attribute) [CheckInNodeID](#_bookmark1118).

2.  The server SHALL follow the [encryption process](#encryption-procedure) of the Check-In Protocol.

3.  The server SHALL configure the Matter header as defined in [message format](#_bookmark1095) section.

> The server MAY try to resolve the IP address and the port of the [CheckInNodeID](#_bookmark1118) each time the server needs to send a Check-In message to a [RegisteredClient](#registeredclients-attribute) [CheckInNodeID](#_bookmark1118).

#### User Active Mode Trigger

> Since ICDs are not immediately responsive, they require a means to render them available for com­ munication for user initiated use cases. Some of the user initiated use cases are:

- Opening a new commissioning window to add another administrator.

- Reconfiguration of an existing fabric (e.g. IPKs, NOC rotation, ACL changes).

- Reconfiguration of cluster functionality (e.g. ICD Management, Bindings, Groups, Scenes).

- Removal of a device from a fabric.

- Changes to the device’s settings.

> An ICD that requires user initiated use cases SHALL provide an Active Mode Trigger as a way for a user to put the device into active mode and make it responsive to controller communication. The [UserActiveModeTrigger](#useractivemodetrigger-feature) feature in the [ICD Management cluster](#icd-management-cluster) indicates whether a particular device implements an active mode trigger.

#### Short Idle Time (SIT) ICD

> ICDs with [Slow Polling Interval](#slow-polling) shorter than or equal to 15 seconds SHOULD be configured as a Short Idle Time ICD. For example, this is a typical scenario for door locks and window coverings, where commands need to be sent to the ICD with a use case imposed latency requirement. Typi­ cally, devices that are Short Idle Time ICDs are not initiators in the communication flow.

1.  **Requirements**

> A SIT ICD SHALL advertise its [SESSION_IDLE_INTERVAL](#_bookmark343) per [SII](#_bookmark213). It SHALL also advertise its [SES­](#_bookmark343) [SION_ACTIVE_INTERVAL](#_bookmark343) per [SAI](#_bookmark214). The device MAY have a [user action](#user-active-mode-trigger) that triggers the ICD to transi­ tion to Active mode.
>
> Having a long ActiveModeThreshold makes the ICD more responsive for subsequent messages at the expense of increased power consumption. The ICD stays in [Active Mode](#_bookmark1090) for the entire duration of the ActiveModeThreshold.
>
> On the other hand, having an ActiveModeThreshold of 0 means that the device might enter [Idle Mode](#_bookmark1088) immediately after the last active [exchange](#message-exchanges-1) is closed. One good example is if a client reads five attributes in a row from an ICD and the ActiveModeThreshold is 0 then it MAY have to wait up to one [Idle Mode Duration](#idlemodeduration-attribute) after each attribute read.
>
> In order to get the benefits of the ActiveModeThreshold attributes while keeping the power consump­ tion low, the ICD MAY ignore the [Active Mode Threshold](#activemodethreshold-attribute) and immediately return to [IdleMode](#_bookmark1088) upon the completion of an exchange if the ICD was the Initiator of the exchange being closed and there are no other reasons keeping it in [active mode](#_bookmark1090).

#### Long Idle Time (LIT) ICD

> ICDs with a [Slow Polling Interval](#slow-polling) longer than 15 seconds SHOULD be configured as Long Idle Time
>
> ICDs. For example, this is a typical scenario for sensors and light switches, where data reports are initiated by the ICD for an updated sensed value or a switch event. Typically, devices that are Long Idle Time ICDs are initiators in the communication flow.

1.  **Overview**

> The high-level steady state behavior of a LIT ICD is to alternate between long IDLE mode periods and short ACTIVE mode periods, where the ACTIVE mode period begins with a transmission to reg­ istered clients. A graphical depiction of ICD steady state behavior is shown in [Figure 74, “ICD Steady](#_bookmark1100) [State Behavior Diagram”](#_bookmark1100).

![](media/image95.png)

> *Figure 74. ICD Steady State Behavior Diagram*
>
> The ICD stays active a minimum amount of time each active mode period, and that time can be extended based on received network activity from registered clients. A graphical depiction of ICD behavior when in ACTIVE mode is shown in [Figure 75, “ICD Active Mode Behavior Diagram”](#_bookmark1101). The ActiveModeDuration starts immediately upon transitioning out of IDLE mode into ACTIVE mode. The ActiveModeThreshold starts immediately upon sending the Check-In message or any other transmis­ sion. The Exchange Context ends upon receipt of a response acknowledgement or timeout. Receipt of a response acknowledgement starts a new ActiveModeThreshold and keeps the ICD ACTIVE for longer. If further messages are received during the ActiveModeThreshold, a new Exchange can be created to keep the ICD ACTIVE for even longer.

2.  **Requirements**

> The device SHALL indicate it is a LIT ICD by setting the [LongIdleTime](#longidletimesupport-feature) feature to 1 in the [ICD Man­](#icd-management-cluster) [agement cluster](#icd-management-cluster). When the device is operating as a LIT ICD, it SHALL advertise 1 with the [ICD dis­](#_bookmark217) [covery TXT key](#_bookmark217). This informs clients that they SHOULD wait for a notification from the LIT ICD before sending any messages to the device. When the device is operating as a SIT ICD, it SHALL
>
> advertise 0 with the [ICD discovery TXT key](#_bookmark217). This informs clients that they SHOULD NOT wait for a notification from the LIT ICD before sending any messages to the device. It SHALL also advertise its [SESSION_ACTIVE_INTERVAL](#_bookmark343) per [SAI](#_bookmark214). A LIT ICD SHOULD NOT advertise its [SESSION_IDLE_INTER­](#_bookmark343)
>
> [VAL](#_bookmark343) with [SII](#_bookmark213). The device SHALL support the [ICD Check-In use case](#check-in-protocol-support) requirements. The device SHALL have a [user action](#user-active-mode-trigger) that triggers the ICD to transition to Active mode. The *[Fast Polling](#fast-polling)* interval SHALL be smaller than the [Active Mode Duration](#activemodeduration-attribute). The [ActiveModeThreshold](#activemodethreshold-attribute) SHALL NOT be smaller than 5 seconds.

3.  **Client Registration Requirement**

> For LIT ICDs to be fully functional, they require clients to support the ICD client behavior. The main client requirements are the client registration process with the [ICD Management cluster](#icd-management-cluster), and the processing of incoming Check-In messages received from the ICD. A LIT ICD SHALL operate as a [SIT](#short-idle-time-sit-icd) [ICD](#short-idle-time-sit-icd) if it doesn’t have at least one registration with any client on any fabric in the [ICD Management](#icd-management-cluster) [cluster](#icd-management-cluster). A LIT ICD MAY operate as a LIT ICD when at least one client has successfully registered.
>
> When operating as a [SIT ICD](#short-idle-time-sit-icd), a LIT ICD:

1.  SHALL NOT set its Slow Polling Interval to a value higher than the [Short Idle Time ICD](#short-idle-time-sit-icd) maxi­ mum.

2.  SHALL advertise its [SESSION_IDLE_INTERVAL](#_bookmark343) using the [SII discovery TXT key](#_bookmark213).

3.  SHALL advertise 0 with the [ICD discovery TXT key](#_bookmark217) to inform clients that it can be reached asyn­ chronously.

4.  MAY ignore the [Active Mode Threshold](#activemodethreshold-attribute) as described in the [SIT ICD Requirements](#_bookmark1098) section.

> After a client has successfully registered with [ICD Management cluster](#icd-management-cluster), a LIT ICD MAY operate as one. When an ICD transitions from operating as a SIT to a LIT ICD, the LIT ICD SHALL respect all the LIT requirements.

4.  **Runtime Operating Mode Switching**

> Due to the registration requirement, LIT ICDs SHALL have the capacity to switch between LIT and SIT operating modes. This ability can be leveraged by devices that have a use case where the device MAY want to remain in the SIT operating mode even if a client has registered. A good example is a Smoke & CO alarm device. While the device is line-powered, it can be very responsive to clients and remain in the SIT operating mode. If it loses line-power, it can transition to LIT operating mode if it has at least one registration and leverage all the LIT ICD features and power efficiency. If the device supports switching between the SIT and LIT operation modes even with a registered client, it SHALL set the [DynamicSitLitSupport](#dynamicsitlitsupport-feature) feature in the [ICD Management cluster](#icd-management-cluster).
>
> Each time a LIT ICD switches between operating modes, both the [mDNS ICD key](#_bookmark217) and [Operating­](#operatingmode-attribute) [Mode](#operatingmode-attribute) attribute of the ICDM cluster must be updated:

- ICD=0 and OperatingMode=SIT if "Long Idle Time ICD is operating as a Short Idle Time ICD",

- ICD=1 and OperatingMode=LIT if "Long Idle Time ICD is operating as a Long Idle Time ICD".

  1.  **Runtime Polling Interval Changes**

> In addition to being able to dynamically switch between LIT and SIT operating modes, an ICD can also dynamically change its [Fast Polling Interval](#fast-polling), [Slow Polling Interval](#slow-polling) and its [Active Mode Thresh­](#activemodethreshold-attribute) [old](#activemodethreshold-attribute). A change in [Active Mode Threshold](#activemodethreshold-attribute) value SHALL trigger a DNS-SD update of the [SAT](#_bookmark343) TXT key. Changes of the SESSION_ACTIVE_INTERVAL or SESSION_IDLE_INTERVAL SHALL also trigger a DNS-SD update of the corresponding [SAI](#_bookmark214) or [SII](#_bookmark213) TXT keys. Note that an update of the polling intervals MAY NOT trigger an update of the [SAI](#_bookmark214) or [SII](#_bookmark213) TXT keys if the new polling intervals are still compliant with the rules from [ICD Session Configurations](#icd-session-configurations) section.

### ICD Client Behavior

> This section provides a description of the client requirements to support [Long Idle Time ICDs](#long-idle-time-lit-icd). A client does not require a specific feature-set to support [Short Idle Time ICDs](#short-idle-time-sit-icd).

#### Check-In Protocol Support

> A client that supports [Long Idle Time ICDs](#long-idle-time-lit-icd) SHALL implement the Check-In Protocol client [require­](#client-requirements) [ments](#client-requirements).

#### Registration Processes

> In order to maximize the reliability of communications with [Long Idle Time ICDs](#long-idle-time-lit-icd), which can be unreachable for extended periods of time, the [ICD Management cluster](#icd-management-cluster) provides a mechanism for clients to register themselves or other monitoring nodes to receive Check-In messages from an ICD. A client that needs to be able to interact with a [Long Idle Time ICDs](#long-idle-time-lit-icd) SHALL invoke the [Register­](#registerclient-command) [Client](#registerclient-command) command against it, typically during commissioning, or have the commissioner or some other existing client send the RegisterClient command on its behalf.
>
> The RegisterClient command supplies three parameters to the server:

1.  A symmetric Key which is used to encrypt the Check-In messages sent by the server.

2.  A node identifier which specifies the node that will receive the Check-In messages.

3.  A subject-id used to determine if a particular client has an active subscription.

4.  The type of the client registering, permanent or ephemeral (e.g. mobile).

> When a client registers with multiple servers, it SHALL use unique keys since the key is used to identify which server sent the Check-In message. Check-In messages do not have an originator address. Therefore, successfully decrypting a Check-In message with a key and having that key cor­ respond to a specific server is the only way to identify which server sent the Check-In message.
>
> If the commissioner is ephemeral and a separate stationary controller exists in the network, the commissioner SHOULD register the stationary controller in the [ICD Management cluster](#icd-management-cluster). Because an ICD is only required to provide one guaranteed client slot per fabric, clients SHOULD self-limit commissioning time registration.

1.  **Commissioner Self-Registration**

> A commissioner that is also a controller can register itself with the ICD during the device configura­
>
> tion portion of the commissioning process. This is the simplest client registration scenario, where a commissioner registers itself during commissioning. At the end of the commissioning process, the commissioner and ICD are coupled.
>
> This diagram shows one possible process a commissioner can use to register itself with an ICD. Other processes are also possible such as a Commissioner which registers itself right after the Add NOC step and before the Operational Discovery step.

![](media/image97.png)

> *Figure 76. Commissioner Self-Registration to ICD*

2.  **External Controller Registration**

> A commissioner can also register an external controller at the time of commissioning. This requires that the commissioner knows the node ID of the controller and that commissioner and controller share a symmetric key used for the client registration by some out-of-band means.
>
> This diagram shows one possible process a commissioner can use to register the controller with an ICD. Other processes are also possible such as a Commissioner which registers the controller right after the Add NOC step and before the Operational Discovery step. The same is true for when the Symmetric Key is shared between devices. Other processes may choose to share the key at a differ­ ent moment in the process.
>
> ![](media/image98.png)
>
> *Figure 77. External Controller Registration*

3.  **Delegated Controller Registration**

> A commissioner can also delegate client registration to some other assisting device or controller. In such a scenario, the commissioner does not register the controller, but instead completes the com­ missioning process and then hands control to the delegated controller to register itself or other clients with the ICD.
>
> When doing so, a commissioner would need to send a command to keep the ICD awake for some amount of time, in order to ensure that an external controller can reach it.
>
> Alternatively, the infrastructure could also be notified of the newly-commissioned ICD before invoking CommissioningComplete, as this would keep the device awake and available for interactions.
>
> This diagram shows one possible process a commissioner can use to register the controller with an ICD.
>
> ![](media/image99.png)
>
> *Figure 78. Delegated Controller Registration*

4.  **Assisted On Demand Registration**

> If a new controller is added to a fabric with existing ICDs, it may be necessary that some existing controller in the infrastructure assist with client registration by providing notification to a new con­ troller when an ICD is active and thus available.
>
> In this scenario, an out-of-band method can be used for the existing controller to detect or be informed of the addition of the new controller and signal to it when present ICDs are active. It should be noted that it is also feasible for a node identity to be instantiated on different hardware to suit the needs of the user. This could allow controllers to be replaced in a system, or have con­ troller identities roam to different hardware without the need to re-register in the client.
>
> This diagram shows one possible process a commissioner can use to register the controller with an ICD.
>
> ![](media/image100.png)
>
> *Figure 79. Infrastructure Assisted On-Demand Registration*

5.  **Assisted Proxy Registration**

> Alternatively, instead of the new controller receiving notification when an ICD wakes up, an exist­ ing controller could be requested to register the new controller when an ICD checks-in. In this way, the existing controller acts as a proxy to register on behalf of the new controller. This requires a queuing or caching mechanism in the existing controller.

![](media/image101.png)

> *Figure 80. Infrastructure Assisted Proxy Registration*

#### Unregistration Process

> When a commissioner or client wants to unregister itself, it can send an [UnregisterClient](#unregisterclient-command) command to the ICD. When a registered client is about to permanently leave the network, it SHOULD send an [UnregisterClient](#unregisterclient-command) command to free its slot for another client.
>
> When an ICD receives the [RemoveFabric](#removefabric-command) command, all registrations associated with the fabric SHALL be removed during the fabric removal process.

#### Post-Commissioning Process

> In addition to registering a client with the ICD, the commissioner or client SHOULD ensure that some node that matches the registered [SubjectID](#_bookmark994) establishes and maintains a subscription with the ICD. A client is not required to establish and maintain a subscription with the ICD. In such case, it can rely on Check-In messages as a heartbeat to provide an indication when it can communicate with an ICD.

#### Client and ICD Relationship

> This section describes how a client and a LIT ICD arrange to communicate with each other. Because [SIT ICD](#short-idle-time-sit-icd)s are reachable on the network without special action by clients, clients need not register with SIT ICDs.

1.  **Communication with an ICD**

> [LIT ICDs](#long-idle-time-lit-icd) have two operating modes. They can either be operating as LIT or as [SIT ICD](#short-idle-time-sit-icd). If the ICD is operating as a [SIT ICD](#short-idle-time-sit-icd), it SHALL advertise this by setting the [ICD discovery TXT key](#_bookmark217) to 0. When the [LIT ICD](#long-idle-time-lit-icd) is operating as a [SIT ICD](#short-idle-time-sit-icd), clients can send their message to the ICD without prior notifica­ tion. If the ICD is operating as a [LIT ICD](#long-idle-time-lit-icd), it SHALL advertise this by setting the [ICD discovery TXT](#_bookmark217) [key](#_bookmark217) to 1. If the ICD is operating as a [LIT ICD](#long-idle-time-lit-icd), it will be unreachable for extended of periods of time. [Permanent](#clienttype-field) clients need to wait for prior notification before sending a message to the ICD. Prior notification typically arrives with these two types of messages :

- Report transaction from the ICD on an ongoing [Subscription](#subscribe-interaction).

- Check-In message from the ICD.

> [Ephemeral](#clienttype-field) clients SHOULD leverage [asynchronous interactions](#_bookmark1104) since they might not be present in the network when the ICD notifies it is available for communication.
>
> After sending either of these messages, an ICD will remain available for a period of time to allow clients to send their messages. Clients that support [LIT ICDs](#long-idle-time-lit-icd) SHOULD sequentially send any buffered interactions for a peer ICD immediately after receipt of a notification from that [LIT ICD](#long-idle-time-lit-icd).
>
> Upon receipt of a Check-In message from an ICD, a client that has lost its previous subscription or intends to establish a new subscription with that ICD SHOULD initiate an attempt to subscribe to the ICD. If the client initiates a session establishment with the ICD in response to a Check-In mes­ sage, then the client SHOULD assume the ICD to be active and use the [SESSION_ACTIVE_INTERVAL](#_bookmark343) for its [MRP](#message-reliability-protocol-mrp) retry intervals. If the client chooses not to establish a subscription, it MAY utilize the Check-In message as a means of tracking a regular heartbeat from the given ICD. If the client no longer intends to interact with the ICD, the uninterested client SHOULD unregister itself from the ICD.
>
> When a client wants the ICD to stay in active mode for a longer duration (typically greater than the duration of ActiveModeThreshold), it can send a [StayActiveRequest](#stayactiverequest-command) command to the ICD server. The StayActiveRequest command SHALL contain a requested time duration (in milliseconds) that the client wants the ICD to stay active for. In response, the ICD SHALL reply with the duration that the
>
> ICD SHALL be active for.

2.  **Asynchronous Interactions**

> Consider a sensor [LIT ICD](#long-idle-time-lit-icd), which primarily exposes telemetry data via read-only attributes and allows a few commands to be executed from its application clusters. Such devices must still be administered, and that can only be carried out when the ICD is reachable.
>
> Likely targets for administration are:

- [Opening a new commissioning window](#opencommissioningwindow-command) to add another administrator.

- Reconfiguration of an existing fabric (e.g. [IPKs](#_bookmark384), [NOC rotation](#updatenoc-command), [ACL changes](#acl-attribute)).

- Reconfiguration of cluster functionality (e.g. [ICD Management cluster](#icd-management-cluster), [Binding cluster](#binding-cluster), Groups cluster, Scenes Management cluster).

- Removal of a device from a [fabric](#removefabric-command).

- Changes to the device’s settings.

> To enable these user initiated use cases, LIT ICDs expose to clients [instructions](#user-active-mode-trigger) on how they can be forced into Active Mode. Clients SHOULD read these instructions from the ICD during the registra­ tion process and persist them. Clients SHOULD expose these instructions to users to permit users to trigger Active Mode as needed.

## ICD Management Cluster

> ICD Management Cluster enables configuration of the [ICD’s](#intermittently-connected-device-icd) behavior and ensuring that listed clients can be notified when an intermittently connected device, [ICD](#intermittently-connected-device-icd), is available for communica­ tion.
>
> The cluster implements the [requirements](#requirements) of the [Check-In Protocol](#check-in-protocol) that enables the [ICD Check-In](#check-in-protocol-support) use case.

2.  **CheckInNodeID Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the NodeID of the Node to which Check-In messages will be sent when the MonitoredSubject is not subscribed.

3.  **MonitoredSubject Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the monitored Subject ID. This field SHALL be used to determine if a par­ ticular client has an active subscription for the given entry. The MonitoredSubject, when it is a NodeID, MAY be the same as the CheckInNodeID. The MonitoredSubject gives the registering client the flexibility of having a different CheckInNodeID from the MonitoredSubject. A subscription SHALL count as an active subscription for this entry if:

- It is on the associated fabric of this entry, and

- The subject of this entry matches the [ISD](#_bookmark654) of the SubscriptionRequest message that created the subscription. Matching SHALL be determined using the subject_matches function defined in the [Access Control Privilege Granting Algorithm](#overall-algorithm).

> For example, if the MonitoredSubject is Node ID 0x1111_2222_3333_AAAA, and one of the sub­ scribers to the server on the entry’s associated fabric bears that Node ID, then the entry matches.
>
> Another example is if the MonitoredSubject has the value 0xFFFF_FFFD_AA12_0002, and one of the
>
> subscribers to the server on the entry’s associated fabric bears the [CASE Authenticated TAG](#_bookmark647) value 0xAA12 and the version 0x0002 or higher within its [NOC](#node-operational-certificate-noc), then the entry matches.

The exact value of N SHALL be made available via [UserAc­](#useractivemodetriggerinstruction-attribute) [tiveModeTriggerIn­](#useractivemodetriggerinstruction-attribute) [struction](#useractivemodetriggerinstruction-attribute) attribute. | True |
| 12 | SetupButton | The Device will enter Active Mode when setup button is pressed. | False |
| 13 | SetupButtonSeconds | The Device will enter Active Mode when setup button is pressed for N seconds. The exact value of N SHALL be made available via the [UserActiveMode­](#useractivemodetriggerinstruction-attribute) [TriggerInstruction](#useractivemodetriggerinstruction-attribute) attribute. | True |
| 14 | SetupButtonLightsBlink | The Device will enter Active Mode when setup button is pressed until associated light blinks. Information on [color](#_bookmark1130) of light MAY be made available via the [UserActiveModeTrig­](#useractivemodetriggerinstruction-attribute) [gerInstruction](#useractivemodetriggerinstruction-attribute) attribute. | True |

|----|----|----|----|
| 15 | SetupButtonTimes | The Device will enter Active Mode when setup button is pressed N times with maximum 1 second between each press. The exact value of N SHALL be made available via the [User­](#useractivemodetriggerinstruction-attribute) [ActiveModeTriggerIn­](#useractivemodetriggerinstruction-attribute) [struction](#useractivemodetriggerinstruction-attribute) attribute. | True |
| 16 | AppDefinedButton | The Device will enter Active Mode when N button is pressed where N identifies which button to press. The value of N SHALL be made available via the [UserActiveMode­](#useractivemodetriggerinstruction-attribute) [TriggerInstruction](#useractivemodetriggerinstruction-attribute) attribute | True |

> An [ICD](#intermittently-connected-device-icd) can indicate multiple ways of being put into Active Mode by setting multiple bits in the bitmap at the same time. However, a device SHALL NOT set more than one bit which has a depen­ dency on the [UserActiveModeTriggerInstruction](#useractivemodetriggerinstruction-attribute) attribute.

#### UserActiveModeTriggerInstruction Attribute

> The meaning of the attribute is dependent upon the [UserActiveModeTriggerHint](#useractivemodetriggerhint-attribute) attribute value, and the conformance is in indicated in the "dependency" column in [UserActiveModeTriggerHint ta­](#idlemodeduration-attribute) [ble](#idlemodeduration-attribute). The UserActiveModeTriggerInstruction attribute MAY give additional information on how to transition the device to Active Mode. If the attribute is present, the value SHALL be encoded as a valid UTF-8 string with a maximum length of 128 bytes. If the [UserActiveModeTriggerHint](#useractivemodetriggerhint-attribute) has the ActuateSensorSeconds, ActuateSensorTimes, ResetButtonSeconds, ResetButtonTimes, SetupButton­ Seconds or SetupButtonTimes set, the string SHALL consist solely of an encoding of N as a decimal unsigned integer using the ASCII digits 0-9, and without leading zeros.
>
> For example, given UserActiveModeTriggerHint="2048", ResetButtonTimes is set which indicates "Press Reset Button for N seconds". Therefore, a value of UserActiveModeTriggerInstruction="10" would indicate that N is 10 in that context.
>
> When CustomInstruction is set by the UserActiveModeTriggerHint attribute, indicating presence of a custom string, the [ICD](#intermittently-connected-device-icd) SHOULD perform localization (translation to user’s preferred language, as indicated in the Device’s currently configured locale). The Custom Instruction option SHOULD NOT be used by an [ICD](#intermittently-connected-device-icd) that does not have knowledge of the user’s language preference.
>
> When the UserActiveModeTriggerHint key indicates a light to blink (ActuateSensorLightsBlink, Reset­ ButtonLightsBlink or SetupButtonLightsBlink), information on color of light MAY be made available via the UserActiveModeTriggerInstruction attribute. When using such color indication in the UserAc­ tiveModeTriggerInstruction attribute, the string SHALL consist of exactly 6 hexadecimal digits using the ASCII characters 0-F and encoding the RGB color value as used in HTML encodings.

#### OperatingMode Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the operating mode of the ICD as specified in the [OperatingMod­](#operatingmodeenum-type) [eEnum](#operatingmodeenum-type).

- If the ICD is operating as a LIT ICD, OperatingMode SHALL be LIT.

- If the ICD is operating as a SIT ICD, OperatingMode SHALL be SIT.

#### MaximumCheckInBackoff Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the maximum time in seconds between two Check-In messages when [back-off](#_bookmark1094) is active. The MaximumCheckInBackoff SHALL NOT be smaller than the [IdleModeDura­](#idlemodeduration-attribute) [tion](#idlemodeduration-attribute).
>
> If the MaximumCheckInBackoff is equal to the [IdleModeDuration](#idlemodeduration-attribute), it means the ICD does not[back-](#_bookmark1094) [off](#_bookmark1094).

> **9.17.7.2.1. When Generated**
>
> This command SHALL be generated in response to a successful RegisterClient command. The ICD­ Counter field SHALL be set to the ICDCounter attribute of the server.

#### UnregisterClient Command

> This command allows a client to unregister itself with the ICD. Example: a client that is leaving the network (e.g. running on a phone which is leaving the home) can (and should) remove its subscrip­ tions and send this UnregisterClient command before leaving to prevent the burden on the ICD of an absent client.
>
> This command SHALL have the following data fields:

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|

The verification key SHALL be provided for clients with manage permissions. The verification key SHOULD NOT be pro­ vided by clients with administrator permissions for the server cluster. The verification key SHALL be ignored by the server if it is provided by a client with administrator permissions for the server cluster.

3.  **Effect on Receipt**

> On receipt of the UnregisterClient command, the server SHALL perform the following procedure:

1.  The server SHALL check whether there is a entry stored on the device for the fabric with the same CheckInNodeID.

    1.  If there are no entries stored for the fabric, the status SHALL be NOT_FOUND. The server SHALL continue from step 6.

    2.  If there is an error when reading from storage, the status SHALL be FAILURE. The server SHALL continue from step 6.

    3.  If there is at least one entry stored on the server for the fabric, the server SHALL continue from step 2.

2.  The server SHALL verify if one of the entries for the fabric has the corresponding CheckInN­ odeID received in the command.

    1.  If no entries have the corresponding CheckInNodeID, the status SHALL be NOT_FOUND. The server SHALL continue from step 6.

    2.  If an entry has the corresponding CheckInNodeID, the server SHALL continue to step 3.

3.  The server SHALL check whether the [ISD](#_bookmark654) of the command has administrator permissions for the server cluster.

    1.  If the [ISD](#_bookmark654) of the command has administrator privileges for the server cluster, the server SHALL continue from step 5.

    3.  If the verification key is equal to the Key value stored in the entry, the server SHALL con­ tinue from step 5.

5.  The server SHALL delete the entry with the matching CheckInNodeID from storage and will per­ sist the change.

    1.  If the removal of the entry fails, the status SHALL be FAILURE. The server SHALL continue from step 6.

    2.  If the removal succeeds, the status SHALL be SUCCESS and the server SHALL continue to step 6.

6.  The server SHALL generate a response with the Status field set to the evaluated status.

#### StayActiveRequest Command

> This command allows a client to request that the server stays in active mode for at least a given time duration (in milliseconds) from when this command is received.
>
> This command SHALL have the following data fields:

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **StayActive­ Duration** | uint32 | all |  |  | M |

> This StayActiveDuration MAY be longer than the ActiveModeThreshold value and would, typically, be used by the client to request the server to stay active and responsive for this period to allow a sequence of message exchanges during that period. The client MAY slightly overestimate the dura­ tion it wants the ICD to be active for, in order to account for network delays.

1.  **Effect on Receipt**

> When receiving a StayActiveRequest command, the server SHALL calculate the maximum
>
> PromisedActiveDuration it can remain active as the greater of the following two values:

- StayActiveDuration\`: Specified in the received command by the client.

- Remaining Active Time: The server’s planned remaining active time based on the ActiveMode­ Threshold and its internal resources and power budget.

> A server MAY replace StayActiveDuration with [Minimum Active Duration](#minimum-value-for-promisedactiveduration) in the above calculation.
>
> PromisedActiveDuration represents the guaranteed minimum time the server will remain active, taking into account both the requested duration and the server’s capabilities.
>
> The ICD SHALL report the calculated PromisedActiveDuration in a [StayActiveResponse](#stayactiveresponse-command) message back to the client.

#### StayActiveResponse Command

> This message SHALL be sent by the ICD in response to the [StayActiveRequest](#stayactiverequest-command) command and SHALL contain the computed duration (in milliseconds) that the ICD intends to stay active for.
>
> This command SHALL have the following data fields:

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **PromisedAc tiveDura­ tion** | uint32 | desc |  |  | M |

4.  **PromisedActiveDuration Field**

> This field SHALL provide the actual duration that the ICD server can stay active from the time it receives the [StayActiveRequest](#stayactiverequest-command) command.

#### Minimum Value for PromisedActiveDuration

> The minimum value of the PromisedActiveDuration field SHALL be equal to either 30000 millisec­ onds or StayActiveDuration (from the received [StayActiveRequest](#stayactiverequest-command) command), whichever is smaller.

## Ecosystem Information Cluster

> The Ecosystem Information Cluster provides extended device information for all the logical devices represented by a Bridged Node. The Ecosystem Information Cluster presents the view of device name and location metadata for presentation by a client of the cluster to a user. This cluster is intended to support Fabric Synchronization and be present on an endpoint with the BridgedNode device type listed in the DeviceTypeList of the endpoint’s Descriptor cluster.
>
> This augments the [Bridged Device Basic Information](#bridged-device-basic-information-cluster) Cluster in the following ways:

- The Ecosystem Information Cluster adds support for providing a name and location for individ­ ual endpoints. (The endpoints do not need to be present on the Bridge for their name and loca­ tion information to be present.)

- The Ecosystem Information Cluster adds metadata to support conflict resolution between multi­ ple sources of the name and location data.

- The Ecosystem Information Cluster supports user control for the presence of the name and loca­ tion information by specifying more restricted access.

> A client SHOULD use the information provided by the Ecosystem Information Cluster to help the user organize and interact with their devices. Some examples may include:

- Directly organizing and labeling the devices in a client’s user interface.

- Providing hints in the user interface, which can assist the user in organizing and labeling their devices.

> For the purposes of the Ecosystem Information Cluster section, an instance of the Ecosystem Infor­ mation Cluster will be referred to as an "instance".

### Revision History

> The global ClusterRevision attribute value SHALL be the highest revision number in the table below.

### Data Types

#### EcosystemDeviceStruct Type

[TABLE]

1.  **DeviceName Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the device’s name, which is provided externally if the user consents. (For example, provided by the user in an ecosystem specific interface.)

2.  **DeviceNameLastEdit Field**

> This field SHALL be present and set if the DeviceName field is present.
>
> This field SHALL indicate the timestamp of when the DeviceName was last modified.

3.  **BridgedEndpoint Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the endpoint this EcosystemDeviceStruct is associated with on this Bridge.
>
> This field SHALL be present and set to a valid endpoint if the device is accessible through the bridge.

4.  **OriginalEndpoint Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the endpoint this EcosystemDeviceStruct is associated with on the origi­ nal device represented by this bridge’s Bridged Node. If this bridge is receiving the device from another bridge, then the OriginalEndpoint field value would be the same on both bridges. This field SHALL be present and set to a valid endpoint on the original device if that device is a Matter device.

5.  **DeviceTypes Field**

> This field SHALL indicate all of the DeviceTypes within the DeviceTypeList in the Descriptor Cluster associated with this EcosystemDeviceStruct entry.
>
> This field SHALL contain a list of valid device type ids.

6.  **UniqueLocationIDs Field**

> This field SHALL specify the EcosystemLocationStruct entries in the LocationDirectory attribute associated with this EcosystemDeviceStruct.

7.  **UniqueLocationIDsLastEdit Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the timestamp of when the UniqueLocationIDs was last modified.

#### NOTE

> If multiple server instances update the UniqueLocationIDs field at the same time, it is possible one of the updates will be missed. This is considered an acceptable limi­ tation to reduce the complexity of the design. Since this is meant to be provided from user input, it is unlikely these signals would be happening at one time.

#### EcosystemLocationStruct Type

| **Access Quality: Fabric Scoped** |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Access** | **Confor­ mance** |

|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 2 | **Location­ Descrip­ torLastE­ dit** | epoch-us |  |  | 0 | S | M |

1.  **UniqueLocationID Field**

> This field SHALL indicate a unique identifier for a specific Ecosystem Information Cluster server instance representing the location independent of its LocationDescriptor field.
>
> UniqueLocationID can be used by the client to determine if the change is a relocation of the device or just a renaming of the location.
>
> No guarantees are given for consistency of the ID between server instances. The same location may be represented by different IDs on different Ecosystem Information Cluster server instances, so only the history from a single server instance should be considered when evaluating a change.
>
> UniqueLocationID SHALL be changed when the LocationDescriptor changes from one existing loca­ tion to another location as a result of an external interaction. (For example, the user changes the location assignment.)
>
> UniqueLocationID SHALL NOT be changed when the LocationDescriptor changes name, but still represents the same location. (For example, the user renames a room.)
>
> UniqueLocationID SHALL be changed when LocationDescriptor changes as a result of another Ecosystem Information Cluster server instance changing and the UniqueLocationID on the remote server instance also changes.
>
> UniqueLocationID SHALL NOT be changed when LocationDescriptor changes as a result of another Ecosystem Information Cluster server instance changing and the UniqueLocationID on the remote server instance does not change.

2.  **LocationDescriptor Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the location (e.g. living room, driveway) and associated metadata that is provided externally if the user consents. (For example, provided by the user in an ecosystem spe­ cific interface.)
>
> "Location" in this context is typically used by the user’s grouping into rooms, areas or other logical groupings of how devices are used. So a device might be part of multiple such "Locations"s.

3.  **LocationDescriptorLastEdit Field**

> This field SHALL indicate the timestamp of when the LocationDescriptor was last modified.

#### NOTE

> The DeviceDirectory and LocationDirectory attributes are Fabric Scoped with Fabric Sensitive fields. The user may direct an ecosystem to disable sharing of user gener­ ated data with specific fabrics in the DeviceDirectory and LocationDirectory attrib­ utes. This can result in a client ecosystem receiving a list of entries scoped only to other fabrics (with only the fabric index visible since all other fields are fabric sen­ sitive) if the user has disabled sharing of user generated data with specific fabrics.

#### DeviceDirectory Attribute

> This attribute SHALL contain the list of logical devices represented by a Bridged Node. Most of the time this will contain a single entry, but may grow with more complex device compositions (e.g. another bridge.)
>
> An empty list indicates that the information is not available.

#### LocationDirectory Attribute

> This attribute SHALL contain the list of rooms, areas and groups associated with the DeviceDirec­ tory entries, and SHALL NOT contain locations which are dynamically generated and removed by an ecosystem. (E.g. a location that is generated and removed based on the user being home is not permitted. However, an initially generated location name that does not quickly change is accept­ able.)
>
> An empty list indicates that the information is not available.
>
> LocationDirectory entries SHALL be removed if there is no DeviceDirectory that references it.

### Examples

#### Bridged Node with One Device and Two Locations

> In the example below, there is a single ecosystem representation of a device for the Bridged Node. The user has configured the name "Dimmable Light" for that device and configured it into two loca­ tions in the ecosystem (the "Living Room" is on the "First Floor" so the device can be in two loca­ tions).

#### Bridged Node with Two DeviceName and Two Locations

> In the example below, there are ecosystem representations of two devices for the Bridged Node. The user has configured them named "Outlet 1" and "Outlet 2". The devices are each configured by the user to be in a single location in the ecosystem.

# Chapter 10. Interaction Model Encoding Specification

## Overview

> This specification details the encoding of the [Interaction Model](#chapter-8.-interaction-model-specification) (IM) in the [Matter TLV format](#appendix-a-tag-length-value-tlv-encoding-format).
>
> Specifically, it details the encoding of the application payload for Matter messages that map to the Interaction Model. The details of the message header are described in [Section 4.4, “Message Frame](#message-frame-format) [Format”](#message-frame-format) and out of scope of this document.

## Messages

### IM Protocol Messages

> Each Action in the IM specification SHALL be mapped to a message with a unique [Protocol Opcode](#protocol-opcode-8-bits), namespaced under the [PROTOCOL_ID_INTERACTION_MODEL](#_bookmark250) [Protocol ID](#protocol-id-16-bits).

- [Vendor ID](#protocol-vendor-id-16-bits) = 0x0000 (Matter Common)

- [Protocol ID](#protocol-id-16-bits) = [PROTOCOL_ID_INTERACTION_MODEL](#_bookmark250)

| **Protocol Opcode** | **Action** | **Message** |
|----|----|----|
| 0x01 | Status Response | [StatusResponseMessage](#statusresponsemessage) |
| 0x02 | Read Request | [ReadRequestMessage](#readrequestmessage) |
| 0x03 | Subscribe Request | [SubscribeRequestMessage](#subscriberequestmessage) |
| 0x04 | Subscribe Response | [SubscribeResponseMessage](#subscriberesponsemessage) |
| 0x05 | Report Data | [ReportDataMessage](#reportdatamessage) |
| 0x06 | Write Request | [WriteRequestMessage](#writerequestmessage) |
| 0x07 | Write Response | [WriteResponseMessage](#writeresponsemessage) |
| 0x08 | Invoke Request | [InvokeRequestMessage](#invokerequestmessage) |
| 0x09 | Invoke Response | [InvokeResponseMessage](#invokeresponsemessage) |
| 0x0A | Timed Request | [TimedRequestMessage](#timedrequestmessage) |

### Common Action Information Encoding

> Every action SHALL encode the fields specified in [Section 8.2.5.1, “Common Action Information”](#common-action-information). The methods for encoding Common Action Information fields are:

- As a field in the message header

- As a context tagged field in the action payload

> For every field appearing in TLV-encoded data described by the schemas of the following sections,
>
> and where a context-specific tag is used, any context-specific tag not listed in a given schema SHALL be reserved for future use and SHALL be silently ignored by clients and servers if seen in a payload.

#### Message Header Encoded Action Information

> The following Common Action Information fields are encoded into the message header:

[TABLE]

#### Context Tag Encoded Action Information

> The following Common Action Information fields are encoded as context tagged fields in the action message payload. All action messages defined in [Section 10.7, “Message Definitions”](#message-definitions) SHALL include these tagged fields:

| **Common Action Field**  | **Context Tag** |
|--------------------------|-----------------|
| InteractionModelRevision | 0xFF            |

### Chunking

> Chunking is the act of splitting an Action that contains attribute/event data, specifically ReportData and WriteRequest actions, into multiple messages at logical boundaries due to the size limitations imposed by IPv6 for UDP packets (see [Section 4.4.4, “Message Size Requirements”](#message-size-requirements) for more details).

> Since attribute/event data within Actions are already organized into a series of [AttributeDataIBs](#attributedataib-1) (for attributes) and [EventDataIBs](#eventdataib-1) for event records, chunking entails maximally packing these information blocks (IBs) into a series of 'data' messages.
>
> To ensure in-order delivery of a chunked set of IBs, each data message requires a response before the next data message can be sent. For [ReportDataMessage](#reportdatamessage) and [WriteRequestMessage](#writerequestmessage), a [StatusRe­](#statusresponsemessage) [sponseMessage](#statusresponsemessage) and [WriteResponseMessage](#writeresponsemessage) are the respective response messages.
>
> A MoreChunkedMessages flag SHALL be set on every data message except the last to convey to the
>
> receiver possible delivery of more chunked messages within a given Action. This is specified in the [WriteRequestMessage](#morechunkedmessages-1) and [ReportDataMessage](#morechunkedmessages).
>
> While most data types can be easily encoded in this scheme to fit within a message, the fact that lists can be of variable, and arbitrary, length can lead to complications. Specific strategies to encode lists that are chunking friendly are provided in [Section 10.6.4.3.1, “Lists”](#_bookmark1186).

## Data Types

> The IM specification defines a number of schema data types that are usable in a given cluster schema definition.
>
> This section will outline their encoding onto TLV wire types, and their specific representations.

| **Class** | **Schema Data Type** | **TLV Type** |
|----|----|----|
| Analog | uint8, uint16, uint24, uint32, uint40, uint48, uint56, uint64 | Unsigned Integer (width is selected automatically depend­ ing on data value) |
|  | int8, int16, int24, int32, int40, int48, int56, int64 | Signed Integer (width is selected automatically depend­ ing on data value) |
|  | float32 | Floating Point Number, 4-byte value |
|  | float64 | Floating Point Number, 8-byte value |

| **Class** | **Schema Data Type** | **TLV Type** |
|----|----|----|
| Discrete | enum8, enum16 | Unsigned Integer (width is selected automatically depend­ ing on data value) |
|  | data8, data16, data32, data64 | Unsigned Integer (width is selected automatically depend­ ing on data value) |
|  | map8, map16, map32, map64 | Unsigned Integer (width is selected automatically depend­ ing on data value) |
|  | boolean | Boolean |
| Composite | [string](#character-string-type) | UTF-8 string (length is selected automatically depending on data value) |
|  | [octstr](#octet-string-type) | TLV octet string |
| Collection | list | TLV [array](#arrays) |
|  | struct | TLV structure |

### Analog - Integer

> All signed integer schema types SHALL be encoded using the TLV signed integer type. The specific TLV element type (1-byte, 2-byte, 4-byte and 8-byte signed integer types) SHALL be selected auto­ matically at runtime depending on the actual value.
>
> In this regard, the actual width of the over-the-wire type can be narrower than the width specified in schema.
>
> E.g. a 32-bit value defined in schema will be encoded to a 1-byte TLV signed integer type if the value doesn’t exceed (-128 to +127).
>
> Similarly, all unsigned integer schema types SHALL be encoded using the TLV unsigned integer type.

### Analog - Floating Point

> Both single and double precision floating point analog schema types SHALL be encoded using equivalent TLV floating point types as well.

### Discrete - Enumeration

> Enumerations SHALL be encoded using the TLV unsigned integer type, with the width selected automatically at runtime based on the actual value.

### Discrete - Bitmap

> Bitmaps SHALL be encoded using the TLV unsigned integer type, with the width selected automati­ cally at runtime based on the actual value.

### Composite - String

> While strings are a derived data type, they SHALL be encoded using the [TLV UTF-8 string](#utf-8-and-octet-strings) type.

### Composite - Octet String

> Octet strings SHALL be encoded using TLV Byte Strings.

### Collection - Struct

> Structure types in schema SHALL be encoded using the TLV structure type.

### Collection - List

> The entirety of a list SHALL be encoded as a TLV array. A list index SHALL start at 0.
>
> Lists SHALL have a maximum size of 65535 elements (2¹⁶-1).

### Derived Types

> All derived types (with the exception of strings) SHALL be encoded according to their base type.

### Field IDs

> Field IDs SHALL be encoded as:

- A context tag when the MEI prefix encodes a standard/scoped source.

- A fully-qualified profile-specific tag when the MEI prefix encodes a manufacturer code. The Vendor ID SHALL be set to the manufacturer code, the profile number set to 0 and the tag num­ ber set to the MEI suffix.

> **NOTE** Support for encoding Field IDs with an MC source is provisional.

## Sample Clusters

> This section defines sample clusters (with attributes, events, and commands) for illustrative pur­ poses; they SHALL NOT be interpreted as real clusters.

### Disco Ball Cluster

> This example cluster controls an imaginary mirrored disco ball, for the express purpose of disco
>
> dancing.

3.  **Element Requirements**

[TABLE]

## Information Blocks

> These are elements that may apply to multiple message types, and are defined in a common way to permit re-use as a definition. Unless stated otherwise, these correspond to their identically named counterparts in the Interaction Model Specification.

### Tag Rules

> Unless otherwise noted, all context tags SHALL be emitted in the order as defined in the appropri­ ate specification. This is done to reduce receiver side complexity in having to deal with arbitrary order tags.

### AttributePathIB

| **TLV Type: List** |  |  |  |  |  |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| **Tag** | **Comments** | **Tag Type** | **Tag Number** | **TLV Type** | **Range** |
| EnableTagCom­ pression |  | Context Tag | 0 | bool | \- |
| Node |  | Context Tag | 1 | Unsigned Int | 64 bits |
| Endpoint |  | Context Tag | 2 | Unsigned Int | 16 bits |
| Cluster |  | Context Tag | 3 | Unsigned Int | 32 bits |
| Attribute |  | Context Tag | 4 | Unsigned Int | 32 bits |
| ListIndex |  | Context Tag | 5 | Unsigned Int | 16 bits, nul­ lable |
| WildcardPath­ Flags |  | Context Tag | 6 | Unsigned Int | 32 bits |

- The contents of [ClusterPathIB](#_bookmark900) in the Interaction Model specification have been expanded here for encoding efficiency.

- The ClusterPathIB Group field is omitted here (see Node field description).

- Maximum nesting is restricted to referencing a list element in an attribute. Consequently, the

> NestedPath field is removed and replaced with a single ListIndex field.

#### EnableTagCompression

> This tag is used to select between two different interpretations on the receiver when the Node, End­ point, Cluster, Attribute tags are omitted:

- When false or not present, omission of any of the tags in question (with the exception of Node) indicates wildcard semantics.

- When true, indicates the use of a tag compression scheme. In this case the value for any omitted tag SHALL be set to the value for that tag in the last AttributePathIB that had EnableTagCompres­ sion not present or set to false and was seen in a message that is part of the same interaction model Action as the current message.

  - The AttributePathIB the values end up coming from MAY appear in the same message (but earlier in it) as the current AttributePathIB.

  - The values that come from the previous AttributePathIB MAY still be missing. In that case, with the exception of Node, they indicate wildcard semantics.

> **NOTE** Support for encoding using the EnableTagCompression tag is provisional.

#### Node

- If the Group field is present in the [IM representation](#_bookmark900), the Group ID is encoded in the [DST](#destination-node-id) field in the message header and elided from the encoding here.

- The Node tag MAY be omitted if the target node of the path matches the NodeID of the server involved in the interaction.

#### Endpoint, Cluster

- Each of these tags can be omitted. The semantics of such omission depend on the value of

> [EnableTagCompression](#enabletagcompression).

#### Attribute, ListIndex

- When [EnableTagCompression](#enabletagcompression) is false or not present, they have the following semantics:

| **Attribute** | **ListIndex** | **Description** |
|----|----|:---|
| Omitted | Omitted | Selects all attributes within the specified Node, Endpoint, Clus­ ter |
| Present | Omitted | Selects a specific attribute within the specified Node, End­ point, Cluster. |
| Present | Present | Selects a specific list item within a top-level attribute of type list. |

> This does not allow expressing all possible paths defined in the interaction model. Only paths that can be expressed MAY be used.

- The ListIndex tag is nullable. The null value SHALL only be used when this AttributePathIB is used in an [AttributeDataIB](#attributedataib-1) and indicates a list append operation. See [Section 10.6.4.3.1, “Lists”](#_bookmark1186) for more details.

#### WildcardPathFlags

- The meaning of the flags present in this tag is defined in [WildcardPathFlagsBitmap](#wildcardpathflagsbitmap).

- The absence of the WildcardPathFlags tag SHALL indicate that all flags are false.

- If the WildcardPathFlags value is zero, is SHOULD be omitted by clients.

- The effect of WildcardPathFlags on AttributePathIB processing is described in [Section 8.2.1.7.1,](#_bookmark862) [“Attribute Wildcard Path Flags”](#_bookmark862).

- The Change field in the Interaction Model specification is not encoded directly. Instead, it is encoded through the use of special values in the Path and Data fields (see [Lists](#_bookmark1186) below).

#### DataVersion

> This tag can be omitted if the value of [EnableTagCompression](#enabletagcompression) in the Path field is true. In this case, the value for the omitted tag SHALL be set to the value for that tag (if present) in the last Attribute­ DataIB that had tag compression disabled (i.e EnableTagCompression not present or set to false) and was seen in a message that is part of the same interaction model Action as the current message. If this tag was not present and tag compression was disabled, it SHALL be interpreted as though a data version was not specified in that, or subsequent AttributeDataIBs.
>
> **NOTE** Support for encoding using the EnableTagCompression tag is provisional.

#### Path

> In addition to the rules specified for [AttributePathIB](#attributepathib-1), the Attribute and 'Cluster' fields within that element SHALL always be present.

#### Data

> Upon [path expansion](#request-path-expansion) of the value in Path, the hierarchy and structure of the encoded data for each
>
> concrete Path SHALL be based on the schema description of the specified attribute within the speci­ fied cluster. The TLV encoding of each element in the data SHALL follow the rules of encoding as provided in [Data Types](#data-types-8).

1.  **Lists**

> The various values in the Change enumeration are realized as follows:

| **Change Type** | **Realization** |
|----|----|
| REPLACE | Path SHALL refer to a list with ListIndex omitted and Data SHALL contain new values that will replace the existing contents of the list. |
| ADD | Path SHALL refer to a list with ListIndex contain­ ing a value of null and Data containing the new value of the list item that will be added to the list. |

#### NOTE

> ListIndex is currently only allowed to be omitted or null. Any other value SHALL be interpreted as an error.
>
> The below bullets detail the suggested patterns for mutating a list, depending on the encoding of the list.

- A single [AttributeDataIB](#attributedataib-1) containing a path to the list itself and Data that contains all items in the list encoded as a TLV array. This option SHOULD be selected if it is possible to encode the entirety of the list in a single [AttributeDataIB](#attributedataib-1) that fits in a single message.

- A series of [AttributeDataIBs](#attributedataib-1), with the first containing a path to the list itself and Data that is an empty array, which signals clearing the list, and subsequent [AttributeDataIBs](#attributedataib-1) each containing a path to each list item with ListIndex being null, in order, and Data that contains the value of the list item. This option SHOULD be selected when it is not possible to encode the entirety of the list in a single [AttributeDataIB](#attributedataib-1) that fits in a single message.

- Multiple ReportDataMessages SHALL be sent if a Report Data action does not fit into a single message. In this case all the ReportDataMessages except the last one SHALL have MoreChun­ kedMessages set to true.

- For each ReportDataMessage received, a successful StatusResponse message SHALL be sent back to the sender unless SuppressResponse is true.

- If MoreChunkedMessages is true, SuppressResponse SHALL be false.

- If MoreChunkedMessages is false, SuppressResponse SHALL be set to the SuppressResponse value in the Report Data action being encoded.

#### EventReports

> A list of [EventReportIB](#eventreportib-1) encoded as a TLV array that have certain compression schemes applied to them to reduce redundant data.
>
> For each EventReportIB in the list:

- The Path tag SHALL utilize the same [tag compression scheme](#enabletagcompression) as that utilized by the tags in [AttributePathIB](#attributepathib). Specifically:

  - The tag compression scheme SHALL only apply to the Node, Endpoint, Cluster and Event tags within the [EventPathIB](#_bookmark912) element.

  - The first element within the list SHALL specify all the necessary tags and hence serve as the anchor on which subsequent items MAY rely for compression.

- The EventNumber MAY be omitted if it is exactly one greater than the EventNumber of the pre­ vious Event.

- The 'Delta' tags SHALL be used to encode timestamps as deltas from the prior event to improve compression of large timestamps.

### InvokeResponseMessage

#### NOTE

> The interaction model is written at the abstract level of actions, and as such, it does not address fragmentation. The interaction model describes a complete response to the invoke interaction as a unit, the chunking protocol described here maintains that illusion as much as possible. The status response messages (Status = SUCCESS) are used for flow control. Status response messages with any other Status indicate the sender of any further chunked InvokeResponseMessages must exit early. In exit­ ing early, the sender MAY send an InvalidAction StatusResponse.

#### InvokeResponses

> If the InvokeResponseMessage is being generated in response to an InvokeRequestMessage contain­ ing InvokeRequests of length 1, it SHALL contain an InvokeResponses element, and it SHALL NOT contain MoreChunkedMessages.

#### MoreChunkedMessages

> Multiple InvokeResponseMessages MAY be sent in a single transaction when multiple Command­ DataIBs were present in the Invoke Request action. All but the last message SHALL have the MoreChunkedMessages flag set to true to indicate this situation, and the last message SHALL have the MoreChunkedMessages flag set to false.
>
> Implementations MAY choose to send the InvokeResponseMessage at any granularity, such as:

- Responding with one InvokeResponseMessage to each CommandDataIB in the corresponding InvokeRequestMessage;

- Waiting to batch the responses until a message full boundary is reached;

- Accumulating all responses to all CommandDataIBs from the InvokeRequestMessage, followed by sending as many messages as needed to fit all the responses.

> These different InvokeMessageResponse buffering strategies all have different buffering costs to the server, different latency for the client, and different latency for command execution.
>
> Upon reception of any InvokeResponseMessage with MoreChunkedResponses set to true, the receiver SHALL respond with [StatusResponseMessage](#statusresponsemessage). Before sending the next InvokeResponseMessage, the sender SHALL await the [StatusResponseMessage](#statusresponsemessage) associated with the previous InvokeResponseMes­ sage. If the Status field in the StatusResponseMessage is set to SUCCESS, that indicates the receiver is ready to process the next InvokeResponseMessage in the chunked series, and in that case the sender SHALL send the next chunk as soon as possible. Any other value of the Status field other than SUCCESS in the StatusResponseMessage SHALL cause the sender of the InvokeResponseMes­ sage to terminate further transmission of InvokeResponseMessages, close the exchange, and con­ sider the Invoke Interaction completed.

#### DataModelRevision Attribute

> This attribute SHALL be set to the revision number of the Data Model against which the Node is cer­ tified. The value of this attribute SHALL be one of the valid values listed in [Section 7.1.1, “Revision](#revision-history-1) [History”](#revision-history-1).

#### VendorName Attribute

> This attribute SHALL specify a human readable (displayable) name of the vendor for the Node.

#### VendorID Attribute

> This attribute SHALL specify the [Vendor ID](#vendor-identifier-vendor-id-vid).

#### ProductName Attribute

> This attribute SHALL specify a human readable (displayable) name of the model for the Node such as the model number (or other identifier) assigned by the vendor.

#### ProductID Attribute

> This attribute SHALL specify the [Product ID](#product-identifier-product-id-pid) assigned by the vendor that is unique to the specific product of the Node.

#### NodeLabel Attribute

> This attribute SHALL represent a user defined name for the Node. This attribute SHOULD be set during initial commissioning and MAY be updated by further reconfigurations.

#### Location Attribute

> This attribute SHALL be an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code to represent the country, dependent territory, or special area of geographic interest in which the Node is located at the time of the attribute being set. This attribute SHALL be set during initial commissioning (unless already set) and MAY be updated by further reconfigurations. This attribute MAY affect some regulatory aspects of the Node’s operation, such as radio transmission power levels in given spectrum allocation bands if technologies where this is applicable are used. The Location’s region code SHALL be interpreted in a case-insensitive manner. If the Node cannot understand the location code with which it was con­ figured, or the location code has not yet been configured, it SHALL configure itself in a region- agnostic manner as determined by the vendor, avoiding region-specific assumptions as much as is practical. The special value XX SHALL indicate that region-agnostic mode is used.

#### HardwareVersion Attribute

> This attribute SHALL specify the version number of the hardware of the Node. The meaning of its value, and the versioning scheme, are vendor defined.

#### HardwareVersionString Attribute

> This attribute SHALL specify the version number of the hardware of the Node. The meaning of its value, and the versioning scheme, are vendor defined. The HardwareVersionString attribute SHALL be used to provide a more user-friendly value than that represented by the [HardwareVersion](#hardwareversion-attribute) attribute.

#### SoftwareVersion Attribute

> This attribute SHALL contain the current version number for the software running on this Node.
>
> The version number can be compared using a total ordering to determine if a version is logically newer than another one. A larger value of SoftwareVersion is newer than a lower value, from the perspective of software updates (see [Section 11.20.3.3, “Availability of Software Images”](#availability-of-software-images)). Nodes MAY query this field to determine the currently running version of software on another given Node.

#### SoftwareVersionString Attribute

> This attribute SHALL contain a current human-readable representation for the software running on the Node. This version information MAY be conveyed to users. The maximum length of the Soft­ wareVersionString attribute is 64 bytes of UTF-8 characters. The contents SHOULD only use simple 7-bit ASCII alphanumeric and punctuation characters, so as to simplify the conveyance of the value to a variety of cultures.
>
> Examples of version strings include "1.0", "1.2.3456", "1.2-2", "1.0b123", "1.2_3".

#### ManufacturingDate Attribute

> This attribute SHALL specify the date that the Node was manufactured. The first 8 characters SHALL specify the date of manufacture of the Node in international date notation according to ISO 8601, i.e., YYYYMMDD, e.g., 20060814. The final 8 characters MAY include country, factory, line, shift or other related information at the option of the vendor. The format of this information is vendor defined.

#### PartNumber Attribute

> This attribute SHALL specify a human-readable (displayable) vendor assigned part number for the Node whose meaning and numbering scheme is vendor defined.
>
> Multiple products (and hence PartNumbers) can share a ProductID. For instance, there may be dif­ ferent packaging (with different PartNumbers) for different regions; also different colors of a prod­ uct might share the ProductID but may have a different PartNumber.

#### ProductURL Attribute

> This attribute SHALL specify a link to a product specific web page. The specified URL SHOULD resolve to a maintained web page available for the lifetime of the product. The syntax of this attribute SHALL follow the syntax as specified in [RFC 1738](#_bookmark43) and SHALL use the https scheme. The maximum length of this attribute is 256 ASCII characters.

#### ProductLabel Attribute

> This attribute SHALL specify a vendor specific human readable (displayable) product label. The ProductLabel attribute MAY be used to provide a more user-friendly value than that represented by the [ProductName](#productname-attribute) attribute. The ProductLabel attribute SHOULD NOT include the name of the ven­ dor as defined within the [VendorName](#vendorname-attribute) attribute.

#### SerialNumber Attribute

> This attribute SHALL specify a human readable (displayable) serial number.

#### LocalConfigDisabled Attribute

> This attribute SHALL allow a local Node configuration to be disabled. When this attribute is set to True the Node SHALL disable the ability to configure the Node through an on-Node user interface. The value of the LocalConfigDisabled attribute SHALL NOT in any way modify, disable, or otherwise affect the user’s ability to trigger a factory reset on the Node.

#### Reachable Attribute

> This attribute (when used) SHALL indicate whether the Node can be reached. For a native Node this is implicitly True (and its use is optional).
>
> Its main use case is in the derived [Bridged Device Basic Information](#bridged-device-basic-information-cluster) cluster where it is used to indi­ cate whether the bridged device is reachable by the bridge over the non-native network.

#### UniqueID Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate a unique identifier for the device, which is constructed in a manufac­ turer specific manner.
>
> It MAY be constructed using a permanent device identifier (such as device MAC address) as basis. In order to prevent tracking,

- it SHOULD NOT be identical to (or easily derived from) such permanent device identifier

- it SHALL be updated when the device is factory reset

- it SHALL NOT be identical to the SerialNumber attribute

- it SHALL NOT be printed on the product or delivered with the product

> The value does not need to be human readable, since it is intended for machine to machine (M2M) communication.
>
> **NOTE** The conformance of the UniqueID attribute was optional in cluster revisions prior to revision 4.
>
> **NOTE** This UniqueID attribute SHALL NOT be the same as the Persistent Unique ID which is used in the [Rotating Device Identifier](#_bookmark520) mechanism.

#### CapabilityMinima Attribute

> This attribute SHALL provide the minimum guaranteed value for some system-wide resource capa­ bilities that are not otherwise cluster-specific and do not appear elsewhere. This attribute MAY be used by clients to optimize communication with Nodes by allowing them to use more than the strict minimum values required by this specification, wherever available.
>
> The values supported by the server in reality MAY be larger than the values provided in this attribute, such as if a server is not resource-constrained at all. However, clients SHOULD only rely on the amounts provided in this attribute.
>
> Note that since the fixed values within this attribute MAY change over time, both increasing and decreasing, as software versions change for a given Node, clients SHOULD take care not to assume
>
> forever unchanging values and SHOULD NOT cache this value permanently at Commissioning time.

#### ProductAppearance Attribute

> This attribute SHALL provide information about the appearance of the product, which could be useful to a user trying to locate or identify the node.

#### SpecificationVersion Attribute

> This attribute SHALL contain the current version number for the specification version this Node was certified against. The version number can be compared using a total ordering to determine if a version is logically newer than another one. A larger value of SpecificationVersion is newer than a lower value.
>
> Nodes MAY query this field to determine the currently supported version of the specification on another given Node.
>
> The format of this number is segmented as its four component bytes.
>
> Bit positions for the fields are as follows:

| **Bits** | **Name** | **Summary** |
|----|----|----|
| 31 .. 24 | Major | Major version of specification. |
| 23 .. 16 | Minor | Minor version of specification. |
| 15 .. 8 | Patch | Patch version of the specifica­ tion. |
| 7 .. 0 | Reserved1 | Future reserved version field 1, set to 0 until defined. |

> For example, a SpecificationVersion value of 0x0102AA00 is composed of 4 version components, representing a version 1.2.170.0.
>
> In the example above:

- Major version is the uppermost byte (0x01).

- Minor version is the following byte (0x02).

- Patch version is 170/0xAA.

- Reserved1 value is 0.

> The initial revision (1.0) of this specification (1.0) was 0x01000000. Matter Spring 2024 release (1.3) was 0x01030000.
>
> If the SpecificationVersion is absent or zero, such as in Basic Information cluster revisions prior to Revision 3, the specification version cannot be properly inferred unless other heuristics are employed.
>
> Comparison of SpecificationVersion SHALL always include the total value over 32 bits, without masking reserved parts.

#### MaxPathsPerInvoke Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the maximum number of elements in a single InvokeRequests list (see [Section 8.8.2, “Invoke Request Action”](#invoke-request-action)) that the Node is able to process. Note that since this attribute MAY change over time, both increasing and decreasing, as software versions change for a given Node, clients SHOULD take care not to assume forever unchanging values and SHOULD NOT cache this value permanently at Commissioning time.
>
> If the MaxPathsPerInvoke attribute is absent or zero, such as in Basic Information cluster revisions prior to Revision 3, clients SHALL assume a value of 1.

### Events

| **ID** | **Name** | **Priority** | **Quality** | **Access** | **Conformance** |

| 0x02 | **Leave** | INFO |  | V | O |
| 0x03 | **Reach­ ableChanged** | INFO |  | V | desc |

#### StartUp Event

> The StartUp event SHALL be generated by a Node as soon as reasonable after completing a boot or reboot process. The StartUp event SHOULD be the first Data Model event recorded by the Node after it completes a boot or reboot process.
>
> The data of this event SHALL contain the following information:

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **Software­ Version** | uint32 |  |  |  | M |

> **SoftwareVersion Field**
>
> This field SHALL be set to the same value as the one available in the [SoftwareVersion](#softwareversion-attribute) attribute.

#### ShutDown Event

> The ShutDown event SHOULD be generated by a Node prior to any orderly shutdown sequence on a best-effort basis. When a ShutDown event is generated, it SHOULD be the last Data Model event recorded by the Node. This event SHOULD be delivered urgently to current subscribers on a best- effort basis. Any subsequent incoming interactions to the Node MAY be dropped until the comple­ tion of a future boot or reboot process.

#### Leave Event

> The Leave event SHOULD be generated by a Node prior to permanently leaving a given Fabric, such as when the [RemoveFabric](#removefabric-command) command is invoked for a given fabric, or triggered by factory reset or some other manufacturer specific action to disable or reset the operational data in the Node. When a Leave event is generated, it SHOULD be assumed that the fabric recorded in the event is no longer usable, and subsequent interactions targeting that fabric will most likely fail.
>
> Upon receipt of Leave Event on a subscription, the receiving Node MAY update other nodes in the fabric by removing related bindings, access control list entries and other data referencing the leav­ ing Node.
>
> The data of this event SHALL contain the following information:

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **FabricIndex** | fabric-idx | 1 to 254 |  |  | M |

> **FabricIndex Field**
>
> This field SHALL contain the local [Fabric Index](#fabric-index-type) of the fabric which the node is about to leave.

#### ReachableChanged Event

> This event SHALL be supported if and only if the Reachable attribute is supported.
>
> This event (when supported) SHALL be generated when there is a change in the Reachable attribute.
>
> Its main use case is in the derived [Bridged Device Basic Information](#bridged-device-basic-information-cluster) cluster. The data of this event SHALL contain the following information:

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **Reachable­ NewValue** | bool |  |  |  | M |

> **ReachableNewValue Field**
>
> This field SHALL indicate the value of the [Reachable](#reachable-attribute-1) attribute after it was changed.

## Group Key Management Cluster

> The Group Key Management cluster manages group keys for the node. The cluster is scoped to the node and is a singleton for the node. This cluster maintains a list of groups supported by the node. Each group list entry supports a single group, with a single group ID and single group key. Duplicate groups are not allowed in the list. Additions or removal of a group entry are performed via modifi­ cations of the list. Such modifications require Administer privilege.
>
> Each group entry includes a membership list of zero of more endpoints that are members of the group on the node. Modification of this membership list is done via the Groups cluster, which is
>
> scoped to an endpoint. Please see the [System Model](#chapter-9.-system-model-specification) specification for more information on groups.

### Revision History

> The global ClusterRevision attribute value SHALL be the highest revision number in the table below.

#### GroupKeyMap Attribute

> This attribute is a list of [GroupKeyMapStruct](#groupkeymapstruct-type) entries. Each entry associates a logical Group Id with a particular group key set.

#### GroupTable Attribute

> This attribute is a list of GroupInfoMapStruct entries. Each entry provides read-only information about how a given logical Group ID maps to a particular set of endpoints, and a name for the group.
>
> The content of this attribute reflects data managed via the Groups cluster (see [AppClusters](#_bookmark13)), and is in general terms referred to as the 'node-wide Group Table'.
>
> The GroupTable SHALL NOT contain any entry whose [GroupInfoMapStruct](#groupinfomapstruct-type) has an empty Endpoints list. If a RemoveGroup or RemoveAllGroups command causes the removal of a group mapping from its last mapped endpoint, the entire GroupTable entry for that given GroupId SHALL be removed.

#### MaxGroupsPerFabric Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the maximum number of groups that this node supports per fabric. The value of this attribute SHALL be set to be no less than the required minimum supported groups as specified in [Group Limits](#group-limits). The length of the [GroupKeyMap](#groupkeymap-attribute) and [GroupTable](#grouptable-attribute) list attributes SHALL NOT exceed the value of the MaxGroupsPerFabric attribute multiplied by the number of [supported](#supportedfabrics-attribute) [fabrics](#supportedfabrics-attribute).

#### MaxGroupKeysPerFabric Attribute

> **Effect on Receipt**
>
> The following validations SHALL be done against the content of the GroupKeySet field:

- If the EpochKey0 field is null or its associated EpochStartTime0 field is null, then this command SHALL fail with an INVALID_COMMAND status code responded to the client.

- If the EpochKey0 field’s length is not exactly 16 bytes, then this command SHALL fail with a CONSTRAINT_ERROR status code responded to the client.

- If the EpochStartTime0 is set to 0, then this command SHALL fail with an INVALID_COMMAND status code responded to the client. Note that internally, a GroupKeySetStruct’s EpochStartTime0 MAY be set to zero, due to the behavior of the AddNOC command which synthesizes a Group­ KeySetStruct (see [IPKValue](#_bookmark1600)). However, the value 0 is illegal in the GroupKeySet field sent by a client.

- If the EpochKey1 field is not null, then the EpochKey0 field SHALL NOT be null. Otherwise this command SHALL fail with an INVALID_COMMAND status code responded to the client.

- If the EpochKey1 field is not null, and the field’s length is not exactly 16 bytes, then this com­ mand SHALL fail with a CONSTRAINT_ERROR status code responded to the client.

- If the EpochKey1 field is not null, its associated EpochStartTime1 field SHALL NOT be null and SHALL contain a later epoch start time than the epoch start time found in the EpochStartTime0 field. Otherwise this command SHALL fail with an INVALID_COMMAND status code responded to the client.

- If exactly one of the EpochKey1 or EpochStartTime1 is null, rather than both being null, or nei­ ther being null, then this command SHALL fail with an INVALID_COMMAND status code responded to the client.

- If the EpochKey2 field is not null, then the EpochKey1 and EpochKey0 fields SHALL NOT be null. Otherwise this command SHALL fail with an INVALID_COMMAND status code responded to the client.

- If the EpochKey2 field is not null, and the field’s length is not exactly 16 bytes, then this com­ mand SHALL fail with a CONSTRAINT_ERROR status code responded to the client.

- If the EpochKey2 field is not null, its associated EpochStartTime2 field SHALL NOT be null and SHALL contain a later epoch start time than the epoch start time found in the EpochStartTime1 field. Otherwise this command SHALL fail with an INVALID_COMMAND status code responded to the client.

- If exactly one of the EpochKey2 or EpochStartTime2 is null, rather than both being null, or nei­ ther being null, then this command SHALL fail with an INVALID_COMMAND status code responded to the client.

> If there exists a Group Key Set associated with the accessing fabric which has the same GroupKey­ SetID as that provided in the GroupKeySet field, then the contents of that group key set SHALL be

> replaced. A replacement SHALL be done by executing the equivalent of entirely removing the pre­ vious Group Key Set with the given GroupKeySetID, followed by an addition of a Group Key Set with the provided configuration. Otherwise, if the GroupKeySetID did not match an existing entry, a new Group Key Set associated with the accessing fabric SHALL be created with the provided data. The Group Key Set SHALL be written to non-volatile storage.
>
> Upon completion, this command SHALL send a status code back to the initiator:

- If the Group Key Set was properly installed or updated on the Node, the status code SHALL be set to SUCCESS.

- If there are insufficient resources on the receiver to store an additional Group Key Set, the sta­ tus code SHALL be set to RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED (see [group key limits](#group-limits));

- Otherwise, this status code SHALL be set to FAILURE.

#### Status Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the participation of this power source in providing power to the Node as specified in [PowerSourceStatusEnum](#powersourcestatusenum-type).

#### Order Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the relative preference with which the Node will select this source to provide power. A source with a lower order SHALL be selected by the Node to provide power before any other source with a higher order, if the lower order source is available (see [Status](#status-attribute)).
>
> Note, Order is read-only and therefore NOT intended to allow clients control over power source selection.

#### Description Attribute

> This attribute SHALL provide a user-facing description of this source, used to distinguish it from other power sources, e.g. "DC Power", "Primary Battery" or "Battery back-up". This attribute SHALL NOT be used to convey information such as battery form factor, or chemistry.

#### WiredAssessedInputFrequency Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the assessed frequency of the voltage, currently provided by the hard-wired source, in Hz. A value of NULL SHALL indicate the Node is currently unable to assess the value. If the wired source is not connected, but the Node is still able to assess a value, then the assessed value MAY be reported.

#### WiredCurrentType Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the type of current the Node expects to be provided by the hard- wired source as specified in [WiredCurrentTypeEnum](#wiredcurrenttypeenum-type).

#### WiredAssessedCurrent Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the assessed instantaneous current draw of the Node on the hard- wired source, in mA (milliamps). A value of NULL SHALL indicate the Node is currently unable to assess the value. If the wired source is not connected, but the Node is still able to assess a value, then the assessed value MAY be reported.

#### WiredNominalVoltage Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the nominal voltage, printed as part of the Node’s regulatory compli­ ance label in mV (millivolts), expected to be provided by the hard-wired source.

#### WiredMaximumCurrent Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the maximum current, printed as part of the Node’s regulatory com­ pliance label in mA (milliamps), expected to be provided by the hard-wired source.

#### WiredPresent Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate if the Node detects that the hard-wired power source is properly con­ nected.

#### ActiveWiredFaults Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the set of wired faults currently detected by the Node on this power source. This set is represented as a list of [WiredFaultEnum](#wiredfaultenum-type). When the Node detects a fault has been raised, the appropriate [WiredFaultEnum](#wiredfaultenum-type) value SHALL be added to this list, provided it is not already present. This list SHALL NOT contain more than one instance of a specific [WiredFaultEnum](#wiredfaultenum-type) value. When the Node detects all conditions contributing to a fault have been cleared, the corre­ sponding [WiredFaultEnum](#wiredfaultenum-type) value SHALL be removed from this list. An empty list SHALL indicate there are currently no active faults. The order of this list SHOULD have no significance. Clients interested in monitoring changes in active faults MAY subscribe to this attribute, or they MAY sub­ scribe to [WiredFaultChange](#wiredfaultchange-event).

#### BatVoltage Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the currently measured output voltage of the battery in mV (milli­ volts). A value of NULL SHALL indicate the Node is currently unable to assess the value.

#### BatPercentRemaining Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the estimated percentage of battery charge remaining until the bat­ tery will no longer be able to provide power to the Node. Values are expressed in half percent units, ranging from 0 to 200. E.g. a value of 48 is equivalent to 24%. A value of NULL SHALL indicate the Node is currently unable to assess the value.
>
> Changes to this attribute SHALL only be marked as reportable in the following cases:

- At most once every 10 seconds, or

- When it changes from null to any other value and vice versa.

> Since reporting consumes power, devices SHOULD be careful not to over-report.

#### BatTimeRemaining Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the estimated time in seconds before the battery will no longer be able to provide power to the Node. A value of NULL SHALL indicate the Node is currently unable to assess the value.
>

#### ActiveBatFaults Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the set of battery faults currently detected by the Node on this power source. This set is represented as a list of [BatFaultEnum](#batfaultenum-type). When the Node detects a fault has been raised, the appropriate [BatFaultEnum](#batfaultenum-type) value SHALL be added to this list, provided it is not already present. This list SHALL NOT contain more than one instance of a specific [BatFaultEnum](#batfaultenum-type) value. When the Node detects all conditions contributing to a fault have been cleared, the corresponding [BatFaultEnum](#batfaultenum-type) value SHALL be removed from this list. An empty list SHALL indicate there are cur­ rently no active faults. The order of this list SHOULD have no significance. Clients interested in monitoring changes in active faults MAY subscribe to this attribute, or they MAY subscribe to [Bat­](#batfaultchange-event)
>
> [FaultChange](#batfaultchange-event).

#### BatReplacementDescription Attribute

> This attribute SHALL provide a user-facing description of this battery, which SHOULD contain information required to identify a replacement, such as form factor, chemistry or preferred manu­ facturer.

#### BatCommonDesignation Attribute

#### BatTimeToFullCharge Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the estimated time in seconds before the battery source will be at full charge. A value of NULL SHALL indicate the Node is currently unable to assess the value.
>
> Changes to this attribute SHALL only be marked as reportable in the following cases:

- At most once every 10 seconds, or

  - When it changes from null to any other value and vice versa.

> Since reporting consumes power, devices SHOULD be careful not to over-report.

#### BatFunctionalWhileCharging Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate whether the Node can remain operational while the battery source is charging.

#### BatChargingCurrent Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate assessed current in mA (milliamps) presently supplied to charge the battery source. A value of NULL SHALL indicate the Node is currently unable to assess the value.

#### ActiveBatChargeFaults Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the set of charge faults currently detected by the Node on this power source. This set is represented as a list of [BatChargeFaultEnum](#batchargefaultenum-type). When the Node detects a fault has been raised, the appropriate [BatChargeFaultEnum](#batchargefaultenum-type) value SHALL be added to this list, provided it is not already present. This list SHALL NOT contain more than one instance of a specific [BatCharge­](#batchargefaultenum-type) [FaultEnum](#batchargefaultenum-type) value. When the Node detects all conditions contributing to a fault have been cleared, the corresponding [BatChargeFaultEnum](#batchargefaultenum-type) value SHALL be removed from this list. An empty list SHALL indicate there are currently no active faults. The order of this list SHOULD have no signifi­ cance. Clients interested in monitoring changes in active faults MAY subscribe to this attribute, or they MAY subscribe to the [BatFaultChange event](#batchargefaultchange-event).

#### EndpointList Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate a list of endpoints that are powered by the source defined by this cluster. Multiple instances of this cluster MAY list the same endpoint, because it is possible for power for an endpoint to come from multiple sources. In that case the Order attribute indicates their priority.
>
> For each power source on a node, there SHALL only be one instance of this cluster.
>
> A cluster instance with an empty list SHALL indicate that the power source is for the entire node, which includes all endpoints.
>
> A cluster instance with a non-empty list SHALL include the endpoint, upon which the cluster instance resides.
>
> The above rules allow that some endpoints can have an unknown power source, and therefore would not be indicated by any instance of this cluster.

[TABLE]

[TABLE]

#### Empty list examples

> Typically, there is one power source for the node. Also common is mains power for the node with battery backup power for the node. In both these common cases, for each cluster instance described, the list is empty.

#### Populated list example

> A node has a mains power source with Order as 0 (zero), but some application endpoints (not all) have a battery back up source with Order as 1, which means this list is empty for the Power Source cluster associated with the mains power, because it indicates the entire node, but the Power Source cluster instance associated with the battery backup would list the endpoints that have a battery backup.

### Configuration Examples

> The following examples illustrate use of the Order attribute in the Power Source Cluster.

#### Example: Redundant Mains Power Sources

> This example describes a design with symmetric, dual-redundant mains power sources, where the system is powered by either one of the power sources. The Node must define two Power Source Clusters, one for each mains source. The system indicates no preference for either source, so the sources have the same Order.

[TABLE]

#### Example: Battery with Mains Power Back-up

> This example describes a design with a built-in battery as the primary source, where the mains power serves to keep the battery charged and act as back-up if the battery fails. The Node must define two Power Source Clusters, one for the battery and another for the mains. Since the battery is primary, it must have a lower Order than the mains source.

> *Power Source (on Endpoint 2)*

[TABLE]

> *Power Source (on Endpoint 5)*

[TABLE]

#### Example: Mains Power with Battery Back-up

> This example describes a design where the system always runs from the a mains power source and the back-up battery is out-of-circuit until mains power fails at which point the back-up battery pow­ ers the system. The Node must define two Power Source Clusters, one for the mains and another for
>
> the battery. Since the mains source is primary, it must have a lower Order than the battery source.

> *Power Source (on Endpoint 2)*

[TABLE]

> *Power Source (on Endpoint 5)*

[TABLE]

#### Example: Battery with Dual Back-up

> This example describes a design with a built-in battery as the primary source, and where two wired sources, USB and a DC adapter, redundantly serve to keep the battery charged and act as back-up if the battery fails. The Node must define three Power Source Clusters, one for each of the battery, the USB source, and the DC adapter. Since the battery is primary, the battery source must have a lower Order than the other sources. This system has no preference between the DC Adapter and USB sources, so these sources will have the same Order.

#### Example: Mains Power with Battery Powered Peripheral

> This example describes a design with a mains powered core and battery powered peripheral. In this example both power sources are required for proper operation. The Node must define two Power Source Clusters, one for the wired source and one for the battery. Since both sources are required, both sources will have the same Order. We will use Endpoint 2 for the mains power and Endpoint 7 for the battery.

## Network Commissioning Cluster

> Network commissioning is part of the overall Node commissioning. The main goal of Network Com­ missioning Cluster is to associate a Node with or manage a Node’s one or more network interfaces. These network interfaces can include the following types.

- Wi-Fi ([IEEE 802.11-2020](#_bookmark29))

- Ethernet (802.3)

- Thread (802.15.4)

> An instance of the Network Commissioning Cluster only applies to a single network interface instance present. An interface, in this context, is a unique entity that can have an IPv6 address assigned to it and ingress and egress IP packets.

#### NetworkInfoStruct Type

> NetworkInfoStruct struct describes an existing network configuration, as provided in the [Networks](#networks-attribute) attribute.

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Access** | **Confor­ mance** |

> **NetworkID Field**
>
> Every network is uniquely identified (for purposes of commissioning) by a NetworkID mapping to the following technology-specific properties:

- SSID for Wi-Fi

- Extended PAN ID for Thread

- Network interface instance name at operating system (or equivalent unique name) for Ethernet.

> The semantics of the NetworkID field therefore varies between network types accordingly. It con­ tains SSID for Wi-Fi networks, Extended PAN ID (XPAN ID) for Thread networks and netif name for Ethernet networks.

#### NOTE

> SSID in Wi-Fi is a collection of 1-32 bytes, the text encoding of which is not specified. Implementations must be careful to support reporting byte strings without requir­ ing a particular encoding for transfer. Only the commissioner should try to poten­ tially decode the bytes. The most common encoding is UTF-8, however this is just a convention. Some configurations may use Latin-1 or other character sets. A commis­ sioner MAY decode using UTF-8, replacing encoding errors with "?" at the applica­
>
> tion level while retaining the underlying representation.
>
> XPAN ID is a big-endian 64-bit unsigned number, represented on the first 8 octets of the octet string.
>
> **Connected Field**
>
> This field SHALL indicate the connected status of the associated network, where "connected" means currently linked to the network technology (e.g. Associated for a Wi-Fi network, media connected for an Ethernet network).

#### MaxNetworks Attribute

> This SHALL indicate the maximum number of network configuration entries that can be added, based on available device resources. The length of the [Networks](#networks-attribute) attribute SHALL be less than or equal to this value.

#### Networks Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the network configurations that are usable on the network interface represented by this cluster server instance.
>
> The order of configurations in the list reflects precedence. That is, any time the Node attempts to connect to the network it SHALL attempt to do so using the configurations in Networks Attribute in the order as they appear in the list.
>
> The order of list items SHALL only be modified by the AddOrUpdateThreadNetwork, AddOrUp­ dateWiFiNetwork and ReorderNetwork commands. In other words, the list SHALL be stable over time, unless mutated externally.
>
> Ethernet networks SHALL be automatically populated by the cluster server. Ethernet Network Com­ missioning Cluster instances SHALL always have exactly one [NetworkInfoStruct](#networkinfostruct-type) instance in their [Networks](#networks-attribute) attribute. There SHALL be no way to add, update or remove Ethernet network configura­ tions to those Cluster instances.

#### ScanMaxTimeSeconds Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the maximum duration taken, in seconds, by the network interface on this cluster server instance to provide scan results.
>
> See [ScanNetworks](#scannetworks-command) for usage.

#### ConnectMaxTimeSeconds Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the maximum duration taken, in seconds, by the network interface on this cluster server instance to report a successful or failed network connection indication. This maximum time SHALL account for all operations needed until a successful network connection is
>
> deemed to have occurred, including, for example, obtaining IP addresses, or the execution of neces­ sary internal retries.

#### InterfaceEnabled Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate whether the associated network interface is enabled or not. By default all network interfaces SHOULD be enabled during initial commissioning (InterfaceEnabled set to true).
>
> It is undefined what happens if InterfaceEnabled is written to false on the same interface as that which is used to write the value. In that case, it is possible that the Administrator would have to await expiry of the fail-safe, and associated recovery of network configuration to prior safe values, before being able to communicate with the node again (see [ArmFailSafe](#armfailsafe-command)).
>
> It MAY be possible to disable Ethernet interfaces but it is implementation-defined. If not supported, a write to this attribute with a value of false SHALL fail with a status of INVALID_ACTION. When disabled, an Ethernet interface would longer employ media detection. That is, a simple unplug and replug of the cable SHALL NOT re-enable the interface.
>
> On Ethernet-only Nodes, there SHALL always be at least one of the Network Commissioning server cluster instances with InterfaceEnabled set to true.

#### LastNetworkingStatus Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the status of the last attempt either scan or connect to an operational network, using this interface, whether by invocation of the [ConnectNetwork](#connectnetwork-command) command or by autonomous connection after loss of connectivity or during initial establishment. If no such attempt was made, or no network configurations exist in the [Networks](#networks-attribute) attribute, then this attribute SHALL be set to null.
>
> This attribute is present to assist with error recovery during Network commissioning and to assist in non-concurrent networking commissioning flows.

#### LastNetworkID Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the NetworkID used in the last attempt to connect to an operational network, using this interface, whether by invocation of the [ConnectNetwork](#connectnetwork-command) command or by autonomous connection after loss of connectivity or during initial establishment. If no such attempt was made, or no network configurations exist in the [Networks](#networks-attribute) attribute, then this attribute SHALL be set to null.
>
> If a network configuration is removed from the [Networks](#networks-attribute) attribute using the RemoveNetwork com­ mand after a connection attempt, this field MAY indicate a NetworkID that is no longer configured on the Node.
>
> This attribute is present to assist with error recovery during Network commissioning and to assist in non-concurrent networking commissioning flows.

#### LastConnectErrorValue Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the ErrorValue used in the last failed attempt to connect to an opera­ tional network, using this interface, whether by invocation of the [ConnectNetwork](#connectnetwork-command) command or by autonomous connection after loss of connectivity or during initial establishment. If no such attempt was made, or no network configurations exist in the [Networks](#networks-attribute) attribute, then this attribute SHALL be set to null.
>
> If the last connection succeeded, as indicated by a value of Success in the [LastNetworkingStatus](#lastnetworkingstatus-attribute) [attribute](#lastnetworkingstatus-attribute), then this field SHALL be set to null.
>
> This attribute is present to assist with error recovery during Network commissioning and to assist in non-concurrent networking commissioning flows.

#### SupportedWiFiBands Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate all the frequency bands supported by the Wi-Fi interface configured by the cluster instance.

#### SupportedThreadFeatures Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate all of the Thread features supported by the Thread interface config­ ured by the cluster instance.
>
> This attribute is primarily used to determine the most important general capabilities of the Thread interface associated with the cluster instance, as opposed to the current runtime dynamic configu­ ration. Note that most run-time details of the actual Thread interface are found in the [Thread Net­](#thread-network-diagnostics-cluster) [work Diagnostics cluster](#thread-network-diagnostics-cluster), if supported.

#### ThreadVersion Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the Thread version supported by the Thread interface configured by the cluster instance.
>
> The format SHALL match the value mapping found in the "Version TLV" section of [Thread specifica­](#_bookmark81) [tion](#_bookmark81). For example, Thread 1.3.0 would have ThreadVersion set to 4.

#### ScanNetworks Command

> This command SHALL scan on the Cluster instance’s associated network interface for either of:

- All available networks (non-directed scanning)

- Specific networks (directed scanning)

> Scanning for available networks detects all networks of the type corresponding to the cluster server instance’s associated network interface that are possible to join, such as all visible Wi-Fi access points for Wi-Fi cluster server instances, all Thread PANs for Thread cluster server instances, within bounds of the maximum response size.
>
> Scanning for a specific network (i.e. directed scanning) takes place if a network identifier (e.g. Wi-Fi SSID) is provided in the command arguments. Directed scanning SHALL restrict the result set to the specified network only.
>
> If this command is received without an armed fail-safe context (see [ArmFailSafe](#armfailsafe-command)), then this com­ mand SHALL fail with a FAILSAFE_REQUIRED status code sent back to the initiator.
>
> The client SHALL NOT expect the server to be done scanning and have responded with ScanNet­ worksResponse before [ScanMaxTimeSeconds](#scanmaxtimeseconds-attribute) seconds have elapsed. Enough transport time affor­ dances for retries SHOULD be expected before a client determines the operation to have timed-out.
>
> This command SHALL fail with a status code of BUSY if the server determines that it will fail to reli­ ably send a response due to changes of networking interface configuration at runtime for the inter­ face over which the command was invoked, or if it is currently unable to proceed with such an operation.
>
> For Wi-Fi-supporting servers (WI feature) the server SHALL always honor directed scans, and attempt to provide all matching BSSID which are reachable on the bands which would otherwise be attempted if a ConnectNetwork having the specified SSID were to take place. This command is use­ ful for clients to determine reachability capabilities as seen by the server’s own radios.
>
> For Wi-Fi-supporting servers the server SHALL always scan on all bands supported by the interface associated with the cluster instance on which the command was invoked.
>
> If the command was invoked over the same link whose configuration is managed by a given server cluster instance, there MAY be an impact on other communication from the invoking client, as well as other clients, while the network interface is processing the scan. Clients SHOULD NOT use this command unless actively in the process of re-configuring network connectivity.

| 1 | **Bread­ crumb** | uint64 | all |  |  | O |

> **SSID Field**
>
> This field, if present, SHALL contain the SSID for a directed scan of that particular Wi-Fi SSID. Oth­ erwise, if the field is absent, or if it is null, this SHALL indicate scanning of all BSSID in range. This field SHALL be ignored for ScanNetworks invocations on non-Wi-Fi server instances.
>
> **Breadcrumb Field**
>
> The Breadcrumb field, if present, SHALL be used to atomically set the [Breadcrumb](#breadcrumb-attribute) attribute in the General Commissioning cluster on success of the associated command. If the command fails, the [Breadcrumb](#breadcrumb-attribute) attribute in the General Commissioning cluster SHALL be left unchanged.

#### ScanNetworksResponse Command

> Results are valid only if NetworkingStatus is Success.
>
> Before generating a ScanNetworksResponse, the server SHALL set the [LastNetworkingStatus](#lastnetworkingstatus-attribute) attribute value to the NetworkingStatus matching the response.
>
> **NetworkingStatus Field**
>
> The NetworkingStatus field SHALL indicate the status of the last scan operation, taking one of these values:

- Success: Scanning succeeded.

- [NetworkNotFound](#_bookmark1346): No instance of an explicitly-provided network identifier was found during the scan. This error cannot occur if no network identifier was provided, such as when scanning for all available networks.

- [OutOfRange](#_bookmark1343): Network identifier was invalid (e.g. empty, too long, etc).

- [RegulatoryError](#_bookmark1347): Could not scan on any bands due to lack of regulatory configuration.

- [UnknownError](#_bookmark1353): An internal error occurred during scanning.

> **DebugText Field**
>
> This field, if present and non-empty, MAY contain error information which MAY be communicated to the user in case the NetworkingStatus was not Success. Its purpose is to help developers in trou­ bleshooting errors and MAY go into logs or crash reports.
>
> **WiFiScanResults Field**
>
> If NetworkingStatus was Success, this field SHALL contain the Wi-Fi network scan results. The list MAY be empty if none were found in range on the bands supported by the interface, or if directed scanning had been used and the desired SSID was not found in range.
>
> The maximum number of results present in the result list supported MAY depend on memory and MAY contain a subset of possibilities, to avoid memory exhaustion on the cluster server and avoid crossing the maximum command response size supported (see [Section 4.4.4, “Message Size Require­](#message-size-requirements) [ments”](#message-size-requirements)).
>
> The order in which results are reported is implementation-specific. Results SHOULD be reported in decreasing RSSI order, even if RSSI is not reported in the response, to maximize the likelihood that most likely to be reachable elements are included within the size limits of the response.
>
> **ThreadScanResults Field**
>
> If NetworkingStatus was Success, this field SHALL contain the Thread network scan results. The list MAY be empty if none were found in range on the bands supported by the interface.
>
> The maximum number of results present in the result list supported MAY depend on memory and MAY contain a subset of possibilities, to avoid memory exhaustion on the cluster server and avoid crossing the maximum command response size supported (see [Section 4.4.4, “Message Size Require­](#message-size-requirements) [ments”](#message-size-requirements)).
>

#### AddOrUpdateWiFiNetwork Command

> This command SHALL be used to add or modify Wi-Fi network configurations.
>
> If this command is received without an armed fail-safe context (see [ArmFailSafe](#armfailsafe-command)), then this com­ mand SHALL fail with a FAILSAFE_REQUIRED status code sent back to the initiator.
>
> The Credentials associated with the network are not readable after execution of this command, as they do not appear in the [Networks](#networks-attribute) attribute, for security reasons.
>
> If this command contains a ClientIdentifier, and the [Networks](#networks-attribute) list does not contain an entry with a matching ClientIdentifier, then this command SHALL fail with a status of NOT_FOUND.

> **SSID Field**
>
> This field SHALL contain the SSID to which to attempt connection. Specific BSSID selection is not supported by this cluster.
>
> **Credentials Field**
>
> Credentials is the passphrase or PSK for the network (if any is needed).
>
> Security type, cipher and credential format (passphrase or PSK) SHALL be contextually auto- selected during execution of the [ConnectNetwork Command](#connectnetwork-command) and during subsequent operational state network connections, based on the most secure Wi-Fi security type available within beacons and probe responses for the set of all discovered BSSIDs for the configured SSID. The type of PSK or passphrase used SHALL be inferred based on the length and contents of the Credentials field pro­ vided, matching the security type chosen.
>
> Valid Credentials length are:

- 0 bytes: Unsecured (open) connection

- 5 bytes: WEP-64 passphrase

- 10 hexadecimal ASCII characters: WEP-64 40-bit hex raw PSK

  - 13 bytes: WEP-128 passphrase

  - 26 hexadecimal ASCII characters: WEP-128 104-bit hex raw PSK

  - 8..63 bytes: WPA/WPA2/WPA3 passphrase

  - 64 bytes: WPA/WPA2/WPA3 raw hex PSK

> These lengths SHALL be contextually interpreted based on the security type of the BSSID where connection will occur.
>
> When the length of Credentials and available set of BSSID admits more than one option, such as the presence of both WPA2 and WPA security type within the result set, WPA2 SHALL be considered more secure.
>
> Note that it MAY occur that a station cannot connect to a particular access point with higher secu­ rity and selects a lower security connectivity type if the link quality is deemed to be too low to achieve successful operation, or if all retry attempts fail.

#### Common processing of AddOrUpdateWiFiNetwork and AddOrUpdateThreadNetwork

> Both AddOrUpdateWiFiNetwork and AddOrUpdateThreadNetwork operate similarly, against differ­ ent underlying technologies. The processing of these commands in the addition and update case is covered by the following subsections.
>
> **Processing an addition**
>
> If the [Networks](#networks-attribute) attribute is already full, the command SHALL immediately respond with Network­ ConfigResponse having NetworkingStatus status field set to BoundsExceeded.
>
> If any of the parameters in the OperationalDataset are invalid, the command SHALL immediately respond with NetworkConfigResponse having NetworkingStatus status field set to a value different than Success and consistent with the error.
>
> If validation of all parameters has succeeded, this command SHALL append the configuration at the end of the existing list in the [Networks](#networks-attribute) attribute, making this new network the one with least prior­ ity.
>
> On success, the NetworkConfigResponse command SHALL have its NetworkIndex field set to the 0- based index of the entry in the [Networks](#networks-attribute) attribute that was just added.
>
> **Processing an update**
>
> If any of the parameters in the OperationalDataset are invalid, the command SHALL immediately respond with NetworkConfigResponse having NetworkingStatus status field set to a value different than Success and consistent with the error.
>
> If validation of all parameters has succeeded, this command SHALL update the existing entry indexed by NetworkID in the [Networks](#networks-attribute) attribute, keeping existing position within the list.
>
> On success, the NetworkConfigResponse command SHALL have its NetworkIndex field set to the 0- based index of the entry in the [Networks](#networks-attribute) attribute that was just updated, and a NetworkingStatus status field set to Success.

#### RemoveNetwork Command

> This command SHALL remove the network configuration from the Cluster if there was already a network configuration with the same NetworkID. The relative order of the entries in the [Networks](#networks-attribute)
>
> attribute SHALL remain unchanged, except for the removal of the requested network configura­ tion.
>
> If this command is received without an armed fail-safe context (see [ArmFailSafe](#armfailsafe-command)), then this com­ mand SHALL fail with a FAILSAFE_REQUIRED status code sent back to the initiator.
>
> The data for this command is as follows:

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **NetworkID** | [octstr](#octet-string-type) | 1 to 32 |  |  | M |
| 1 | **Bread­ crumb** | uint64 | all |  |  | O |

> If the [Networks](#networks-attribute) attribute does not contain a matching entry, the command SHALL immediately respond with NetworkConfigResponse having NetworkingStatus status field set to NetworkIdNot­ Found.
>
> On success, the NetworkConfigResponse command SHALL have its NetworkIndex field set to the 0- based index of the entry in the [Networks](#networks-attribute) attribute that was just removed, and a NetworkingStatus status field set to Success.

>
> This field SHALL contain the NetworkID for the entry to remove: the SSID for Wi-Fi and XPAN ID for Thread.
>
> **Breadcrumb Field**

#### NetworkConfigResponse Command

> This response command relates status information for some commands which require it as their response command. See each individual cluster server command for the situations that may cause a NetworkingStatus different than Success.
>
> The data for this command is as follows:

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|

|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 2 | **Net­ workIndex** | uint8 | max (MaxNet­ works - 1) |  |  | O |

> Before generating a NetworkConfigResponse, the server SHALL set the [LastNetworkingStatus](#lastnetworkingstatus-attribute) attribute value to the NetworkingStatus matching the response.
>
> Before generating a NetworkConfigResponse, the server SHALL set the [LastNetworkID](#lastnetworkid-attribute) attribute value to the NetworkID that was used in the command for which an invocation caused the response to be generated.
>
> **NetworkingStatus Field**
>
> The NetworkingStatus field SHALL indicate the status of the last operation attempting to modify the [Networks](#networks-attribute) attribute configuration, taking one of these values:

- Success: Operation succeeded.

- [OutOfRange](#_bookmark1343): Network identifier was invalid (e.g. empty, too long, etc).

- [BoundsExceeded](#_bookmark1344): Adding this network configuration would exceed the limit defined by [MaxNet­](#maxnetworks-attribute) [works](#maxnetworks-attribute).

- [NetworkIdNotFound](#_bookmark1345): The network identifier was expected to be found, but was not found among the added network configurations in [Networks](#networks-attribute) attribute.

- [UnknownError](#_bookmark1353): An internal error occurred during the operation.

> **DebugText Field**
>
> See [DebugText](#_bookmark1368) for usage.
>
> **NetworkIndex Field**
>
> When the NetworkingStatus is Success, this field SHALL be present. It SHALL contain the 0-based index of the entry in the [Networks](#networks-attribute) attribute that was last added, updated or removed successfully by the associated request command.

#### ConnectNetwork Command

> This command SHALL attempt to connect to a network whose configuration was previously added by either the [AddOrUpdateWiFiNetwork](#addorupdatewifinetwork-command) or [AddOrUpdateThreadNetwork](#addorupdatethreadnetwork-command) commands. Network is identified by its NetworkID.
>
> The data for this command is as follows:

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **NetworkID** | [octstr](#octet-string-type) | 1 to 32 |  |  | M |

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 1 | **Bread­ crumb** | uint64 | all |  |  | O |

> This command SHALL fail with a BUSY status code returned to the initiator if the server is currently unable to proceed with such an operation, such as if it is currently attempting to connect in the background, or is already proceeding with a prior ConnectNetwork.
>
> If this command is received without an armed fail-safe context (see [ArmFailSafe](#armfailsafe-command)), then this com­ mand SHALL fail with a FAILSAFE_REQUIRED status code sent back to the initiator.
>
> Before connecting to the new network, the Node SHALL disconnect the operational network con­ nections managed by any other Network Commissioning cluster instances (whether under the Root Node or a Secondary Network Interface), where those connections are not represented by an entry in the Networks attribute of the corresponding cluster instance. This ensures that an Administrator or Commissioner can reliably reconfigure the operational network connection of a device that has one or more Secondary Network interfaces, for example by removing the active network configura­ tion from one cluster instance, followed by adding a new configuration and calling ConnectNet­ work on a different cluster instance.
>
> Success or failure of this command SHALL be communicated by the ConnectNetworkResponse com­ mand, unless some data model validations caused a FAILURE status to be sent prior to finishing execution of the command. The ConnectNetworkResponse SHALL indicate the value Success in the NetworkingStatus field on successful connection. On failure to connect, the ConnectNetworkRe­ sponse SHALL contain an appropriate NetworkingStatus, DebugText and ErrorValue indicating the reason for failure.
>
> The amount of time needed to determine successful or failing connectivity on the cluster server’s associated interface is provided by the [ConnectMaxTimeSeconds](#connectmaxtimeseconds-attribute) attribute. Clients SHALL NOT con­ sider the connection to have timed-out until at least that duration has taken place. For non-concur­ rent commissioning situations, the client SHOULD allow additional margin of time to account for its delay in executing [operational discovery](#operational-discovery) of the Node once it is connected to the new network.
>
> On successful connection, the entry associated with the given Network configuration in the [Net­](#networks-attribute) [works](#networks-attribute) attribute SHALL indicate its Connected field set to true, and all other entries, if any exist, SHALL indicate their Connected field set to false.
>
> On failure to connect, the entry associated with the given Network configuration in the [Networks](#networks-attribute) attribute SHALL indicate its Connected field set to false.
>
> The precedence order of any entry subject to ConnectNetwork SHALL NOT change within the [Net­](#networks-attribute) [works](#networks-attribute) attribute.
>
> Even after successfully connecting to a network, the configuration SHALL revert to the prior state of configuration if the CommissioningComplete command (see [CommissioningComplete](#commissioningcomplete-command)) is not suc­ cessfully invoked before expiry of the Fail-Safe timer.
>
> When non-concurrent commissioning is being used by a Commissioner or Administrator, the Con­
>
> nectNetworkResponse SHALL be sent with the NetworkingStatus field set to Success prior to closing the commissioning channel, even if not yet connected to the operational network, unless the device would be incapable of joining that network, in which case the usual failure path described in the prior paragraphs SHALL be followed. Once the commissioning channel is closed, the operational channel will be started. It is possible that the only method to determine success of the operation is operational discovery of the Node on the new operational network. Therefore, before invoking the ConnectNetwork command, the client SHOULD re-invoke the [Arm Fail-Safe](#armfailsafe-command) command with a dura­ tion that meets the following:

1.  Sufficient time to meet the minimum required time (see [ConnectMaxTimeSeconds](#connectmaxtimeseconds-attribute)) that may be taken by the server to connect to the desired network.

2.  Sufficient time to account for possible message-layer retries when a response is requested.

3.  Sufficient time to allow [operational discovery](#operational-discovery) on the new network by a Commissioner or Administrator.

4.  Sufficient time to establish a [CASE](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case) session after operational discovery

5.  Not so long that, in error situations, the delay to reverting back to being discoverable for com­ missioning with a previous configuration would cause significant user-perceived delay.

> Note as well that the CommissioningTimeout duration provided in a prior [OpenCommissioningWin­](#opencommissioningwindow-command) [dow](#opencommissioningwindow-command) or [OpenBasicCommissioningWindow](#openbasiccommissioningwindow-command) command may impact the total time available to proceed with error recovery after a connection failure.
>
> The [LastNetworkingStatus](#lastnetworkingstatus-attribute), [LastNetworkID](#lastnetworkid-attribute) and [LastConnectErrorValue](#lastconnecterrorvalue-attribute) attributes MAY assist the client in determining the reason for a failure after reconnecting over a Commissioning channel, especially in non-concurrent commissioning situations.
>
> **NetworkID Field**
>
> This field SHALL contain the NetworkID for the entry used to configure the connection: the SSID for Wi-Fi and XPAN ID for Thread.
>
> **Breadcrumb Field**
>
> See [Breadcrumb](#_bookmark1367) for usage.

#### ConnectNetworkResponse Command

> The data for this command is as follows:

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|

| 1 | **DebugText** | [string](#character-string-type) |  |  |  | O |
| 2 | **ErrorValue** | int32 | all | X |  | M |

> Before generating a ConnectNetworkResponse, the server SHALL:

- Set the [LastNetworkingStatus](#lastnetworkingstatus-attribute) attribute value to the NetworkingStatus matching the response.

- Set the [LastNetworkID](#lastnetworkid-attribute) attribute value to the NetworkID that was used in the ConnectNetwork command which caused the response to be generated.

- Set the [LastConnectErrorValue](#lastconnecterrorvalue-attribute) attribute value to the ErrorValue matching the response, includ­ ing setting it to null if the ErrorValue is not applicable.

> **NetworkingStatus Field**
>
> The NetworkingStatus field SHALL indicate the status of the last connection attempt, taking one of these values:

- Success: Connection succeeded.

- [NetworkNotFound](#_bookmark1346): No instance of an explicitly-provided network identifier was found during the attempt to join the network.

- [OutOfRange](#_bookmark1343): Network identifier was invalid (e.g. empty, too long, etc).

- [NetworkIdNotFound](#_bookmark1345): The network identifier was not found among the added network configu­ rations in [Networks](#networks-attribute) attribute.

- [RegulatoryError](#_bookmark1347): Could not connect to a network due to lack of regulatory configuration.

- [UnknownError](#_bookmark1353): An internal error occurred during the operation.

- Association errors (see also description of errors in [NetworkCommissioningStatusEnum](#networkcommissioningstatusenum-type)): [Auth­](#_bookmark1348) [Failure](#_bookmark1348), [UnsupportedSecurity](#_bookmark1349), [OtherConnectionFailure](#_bookmark1350), [IPV6Failed](#_bookmark1351), [IPBindFailed](#_bookmark1352)

> **DebugText Field**
>
> See [DebugText](#_bookmark1368) for usage.
>
> **ErrorValue Field**

- ErrorValue interpretation for Wi-Fi association errors:

  - On any association failure during enabling of a network, the ErrorValue field SHALL be set to the Status Code value that was present in the last frame related to association where Sta­ tus Code was not equal to zero and which caused the failure of a final retry attempt, if this final failure was due to one of the following Management frames:

    - Association Response (Type 0, Subtype 1)

    - Reassociation Response (Type 0, Subtype 3)

    - Authentication (Type 0, Subtype 11)

  - Table 9-50 "Status Codes" in [IEEE 802.11-2020](#_bookmark29) contains a description of all values possible, which can unambiguously be used to determine the cause, such as an invalid security type, unsupported rate, etc.

- Otherwise, the ErrorValue field SHALL contain an implementation-dependent value which MAY be used by a reader of the structure to record, report or diagnose the failure.

#### ReorderNetwork Command

> This command SHALL set the specific order of the network configuration selected by its NetworkID in the [Networks](#networks-attribute) attribute to match the position given by NetworkIndex.
>
> The data for this command is as follows:

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **NetworkID** | [octstr](#octet-string-type) | 1 to 32 |  |  | M |
| 1 | **Net­ workIndex** | uint8 | desc |  |  | M |
| 2 | **Bread­ crumb** | uint64 | all |  |  | O |

> **NetworkID Field**
>
> This field SHALL contain the NetworkID for the entry to reorder: the SSID for Wi-Fi and XPAN ID for Thread.
>
> **NetworkIndex Field**
>
> This field SHALL contain the 0-based index of the new desired position of the entry in the [Networks](#networks-attribute) attribute.
>
> **Breadcrumb Field**
>
> See [Breadcrumb](#_bookmark1367) for usage.
>
> **Effect when received**
>
> If the [Networks](#networks-attribute) attribute does not contain a matching entry, the command SHALL immediately respond with NetworkConfigResponse having NetworkingStatus status field set to NetworkIdNot­ Found.
>
> If the NetworkIndex field has a value larger or equal to the current number of entries in the [Net­](#networks-attribute) [works](#networks-attribute) attribute, the command SHALL immediately respond with NetworkConfigResponse having NetworkingStatus status field set to OutOfRange.
>
> On success, the NetworkConfigResponse command SHALL have its NetworkIndex field set to the 0- based index of the entry in the [Networks](#networks-attribute) attribute that was just updated, matching the incoming NetworkIndex, and a NetworkingStatus status field set to Success.
>
> The entry selected SHALL be inserted at the new position in the list. All other entries, if any exist, SHALL be moved to allow the insertion, in a way that they all retain their existing relative order between each other, with the exception of the newly re-ordered entry.
>
> Re-ordering to the same NetworkIndex as the current location SHALL be considered as a success and yield no visible changes of the [Networks](#networks-attribute) attribute.
>
> **Examples of re-ordering**
>
> To better illustrate the re-ordering operation, consider this initial state, exemplary of a Wi-Fi device:

| **Index in list** | **NetworkID field** | **Connected field** |
|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 0                 | FancyCat            | false               |
| 1                 | BlueDolphin         | true                |
| 2                 | Home-Guest          | false               |
| 3                 | WillowTree          | false               |

> On receiving ReorderNetwork with:

- NetworkID = Home-Guest

- NetworkIndex = 0

> The outcome, after applying to the **initial state** would be:

| **Index in list** | **NetworkID field** | **Connected field** |
|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 0                 | Home-Guest          | false               |
| 1                 | FancyCat            | false               |
| 2                 | BlueDolphin         | true                |
| 3                 | WillowTree          | false               |

> In the above outcome, FancyCat and BlueDolphin moved "down" and Home-Guest became the high­ est priority network in the list.
>
> On receiving ReorderNetwork with:

- NetworkID = FancyCat

- NetworkIndex = 3

> The outcome, after applying to the **initial state** would be:

| **Index in list** | **NetworkID field** | **Connected field** |
|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 0                 | BlueDolphin         | true                |
| 1                 | Home-Guest          | false               |
| 2                 | WillowTree          | false               |
| 3                 | FancyCat            | false               |

> In the above outcome, BlueDolphin, Home-Guest and WillowTree moved "up" and FancyCat became the lowest priority network in the list.

### Usage of networking configurations

> This section describes how to ensure deterministic and well-behaved network connectivity, both when concurrent and non-concurrent commissioning flows (see [Section 5.5, “Commissioning](#commissioning-flows) [Flows”](#commissioning-flows)) are used.
>
> Operational Networking configuration is managed by the set of Network Commissioning cluster server instances distributed on a Node’s Endpoints.
>
> Since Matter employs IPv6 communication and DNS-SD for operational [Discovery](#discovery), there is a funda­ mental aspect of multi-homing present, where a Node with multiple concurrently operated net­ work interfaces device may be reachable using a variety of addresses on different network tech­ nologies. Care SHOULD be taken by Administrators and Commissioners to avoid making strong assumptions about single address reachability. Administrators and Commissioners SHOULD be pre­ pared to attempt reachability tests against specific network technologies if the final desired state of networking requires a specific reachable path.
>
> A Node MAY be configured in such a way that there are no Network Commissioning cluster server instances present, in which case the remainder of this section SHALL NOT apply.

#### Network Interfaces

> **Primary Network Interface**
>
> The primary network interface of a Node SHALL be the one present on the root node endpoint (see [Section 9.2, “Endpoint Composition”](#endpoint-composition)). This interface SHOULD be the one most likely to yield an operational reachable state if appropriately configured.
>
> **Secondary Network Interfaces**
>
> The secondary network interfaces SHOULD be additional technologies that MAY increase reachabil­ ity or support a [stub router feature](#stub-router-behavior). These interfaces SHALL be hosted by endpoints other than the root node endpoint, which SHALL support the Secondary Network Interface device type.
>
> A Node supporting secondary network interfaces SHALL support the concurrent connection com­ missioning flow (see [Figure 32, “Concurrent connection commissioning flow”](#_bookmark547)). Therefore, if the pri­ mary network configuration fails, the Commissioner can proceed to configure the secondary net­ work interfaces via the established commissioning channel.

#### Order of connectivity during connection establishment

> When at least one Network Commissioning cluster server instance (hereafter, "Network Commis­ sioning cluster" for short), the following behavior SHOULD take place for each interface associated with a Network Commissioning cluster, in increasing order of associated endpoint number:

1.  If the Network Commissioning cluster’s InterfaceEnabled attribute is set to false, skip the pro­ cessing the interface altogether.

2.  Set all configurations of the [Networks attribute](#networks-attribute) entry’s Connected field to false

3.  Iterate through all configurations in the [Networks attribute](#networks-attribute)

> a\. If there was a "last known good" network configuration, that is, the one which was both last successfully connected during prior boot and over which at least one secure channel exchange message was received, it MAY be used as the first attempt. Otherwise, iterate through all configurations in the precedence order of the list, starting at index 0.

4.  Attempt to connect to the technology, using the current iteration’s network configuration

5.  On success, set the Connected state of the list entry to true, and stop attempting further connec­ tion. Otherwise, on failure, move to the next configuration.

#### Connectivity management during commissioning or administration

> When a network interface is configured during commissioning or reconfigured during ongoing administration, behavior is different than for the startup case described previously, since there are tentative attempts being made to make a Node reachable on an operational network.
>
> Network configuration can be seen as:

- A list of existing configurations, reflected by the [Networks attribute](#networks-attribute).

  - The list SHALL be managed by the AddOrUpdateWiFiNetwork, AddOrUpdateThreadNet­ work, RemoveNetwork and ReorderNetwork commands.

  - The list SHALL be tentative until committed by successful invocation of the [Commissioning­](#commissioningcomplete-command) [Complete](#commissioningcomplete-command) command, or reverted to prior configuration by the expiry of the Fail-Safe timer (see [ArmFailSafe](#armfailsafe-command)).

- A current candidate configuration, the subject of the most recent ConnectNetwork command.

  - There SHALL NOT be new connections to any network during the Fail-Safe timer period unless attempted by invocation of the ConnectNetwork command.

> Failures of connection during the Fail-Safe timer window SHALL cause the Node to follow the steps in [Section 5.5.1, “Commissioning Flows Error Handling”](#commissioning-flows-error-handling) after recording the cause of the failure in the [LastNetworkingStatus](#lastnetworkingstatus-attribute), [LastNetworkID](#lastnetworkid-attribute) and [LastConnectErrorValue](#lastconnecterrorvalue-attribute) attributes.
>
> After Commissioning or reconfiguration ends successfully, because of successful invocation of the [CommissioningComplete](#commissioningcomplete-command) command, the cluster server SHOULD NOT attempt to change connected network until connectivity failure or restart occurs, but rather it SHALL commit the tentative con­ figuration to persistent storage so that it is usable the next time connectivity establishment is needed.
>
> After Commissioning or reconfiguration ends in failure due to expiry of the Fail-Safe timer, the Node SHALL revert to the network configuration present prior to the Fail-Safe timer being armed.
>
> Because it is possible that multiple network configurations being present could successfully result in an established operational network connection, but only some of these configurations actually have the desired reachability by Administrators on certain fabrics, the following precautions SHOULD be taken to avoid a situation where a Node forever dwells on a network with successful connectivity, but no reachable peers:

- Commissioners and Administrators MAY notify users if multiple independent configurations exist that could cause an alternate configuration to make the device unreachable for reconfigu­

> ration by Nodes on the current client’s fabric in the future.

- Commissioners and Administrators SHOULD avoid configuring Nodes in ways where it may be ambiguous to end-users which final network configuration will take place.

- Cluster servers on devices with no user interface to express current network configuration to an end-user SHOULD be configured to only support a single entry in the [Networks attribute](#networks-attribute).

- Upon discovering that a user is desiring to configure a Network in a way that would change the set of configured networks, and there are multiple fabrics configured in the [Fabrics](#fabrics-attribute) attribute of the [Node Operational Credentials](#node-operational-credentials-cluster) cluster, the client SHOULD notify the user that some other Administrators on other fabrics MAY fail to reach the Node and report connectivity failures.

## General Commissioning Cluster

> This cluster is used to manage basic commissioning lifecycle.
>
> This cluster also represents responsibilities related to commissioning that don’t well fit other com­ missioning clusters, like [Section 11.9, “Network Commissioning Cluster”](#network-commissioning-cluster). It also hosts functionalities those other clusters may depend on.

> **MaxCumulativeFailsafeSeconds Field**
>
> This field SHALL contain a conservative value in seconds denoting the maximum total duration for which a fail safe timer can be re-armed. See [Section 11.10.7.2.1, “Fail Safe Context”](#_bookmark1407).
>
> The value of this field SHALL be greater than or equal to the FailSafeExpiryLengthSeconds. Absent additional guidelines, it is RECOMMENDED that the value of this field be aligned with the initial [Announcement Duration](#announcement-duration) and default to 900 seconds.

[TABLE]

#### Breadcrumb Attribute

> This attribute allows for the storage of a client-provided small payload which Administrators and Commissioners MAY write and then subsequently read, to keep track of their own progress. This MAY be used by the Commissioner to avoid repeating already-executed actions upon re-establishing a commissioning link after an error.
>
> On start/restart of the server, such as when a device is power-cycled, this attribute SHALL be reset to zero.
>
> Some commands related to commissioning also have a side-effect of updating or resetting this attribute and this is specified in their respective functional descriptions.
>
> The format of the value within this attribute is unspecified and its value is not otherwise used by the functioning of any cluster, other than being set as a side-effect of commands where this behav­ ior is described.

#### BasicCommissioningInfo Attribute

> This attribute SHALL describe critical parameters needed at the beginning of commissioning flow. See [BasicCommissioningInfo](#basiccommissioninginfo-type) for more information.

#### RegulatoryConfig Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the regulatory configuration for the product.
>
> Note that the country code is part of [Basic Information Cluster](#basic-information-cluster) and therefore NOT listed on the Reg­ ulatoryConfig attribute.

#### LocationCapability Attribute

> LocationCapability is statically set by the manufacturer and indicates if this Node needs to be told an exact RegulatoryLocation. For example a Node which is "Indoor Only" would not be certified for outdoor use at all, and thus there is no need for a commissioner to set or ask the user about whether the device will be used inside or outside. However a device which states its capability is
>
> "Indoor/Outdoor" means it would like clarification if possible.
>
> For Nodes without radio network interfaces (e.g. Ethernet-only devices), the value IndoorOutdoor SHALL always be used.
>
> The default value of the [RegulatoryConfig](#regulatoryconfig-attribute) attribute is the value of LocationCapability attribute. This means devices always have a safe default value, and Commissioners which choose to implement smarter handling can.

#### SupportsConcurrentConnection Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate whether this device supports "concurrent connection flow" commis­ sioning mode (see [Section 5.5, “Commissioning Flows”](#commissioning-flows)). If false, the device only supports "non-con­ current connection flow" mode.

#### TCAcceptedVersion Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the last version of the T&Cs for which the device received user acknowledgements. On factory reset this field SHALL be reset to 0.
>
> When [Custom Commissioning Flow](#custom-commissioning-flow) is used to obtain user consent (e. g. because the Commissioner does not support the TC feature), the manufacturer-provided means for obtaining user consent SHALL ensure that this attribute is set to a value which is greater than or equal to [TCMinRequired­](#tcminrequiredversion-attribute) [Version](#tcminrequiredversion-attribute) before returning the user back to the originating Commissioner (see [Enhanced Setup Flow](#enhanced-setup-flow-esf)).

#### TCMinRequiredVersion Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the minimum version of the texts presented by the Enhanced Setup Flow that need to be accepted by the user for this device. This attribute MAY change as the result of an OTA update.
>
> If an event such as a software update causes TCAcceptedVersion to become less than TCMinRe­ quiredVersion, then the device SHALL update [TCAcknowledgementsRequired](#tcacknowledgementsrequired-attribute) to True so that an administrator can detect that a newer version of the texts needs to be presented to the user.

#### TCAcknowledgements Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the user’s response to the presented terms. Each bit position corre­ sponds to a user response for the associated index of matching text, such that bit 0 (bit value 1) is for text index 0. Bit 15 (bit value 0x8000) is for text index 15. A bit value of 1 indicates acceptance and a value of 0 indicates non-acceptance. For example, if there are two texts that were presented where the first (bit 0, value 1) was declined and the second accepted (bit 1, value 2), we would expect the resulting value of the map to be 2.
>
> Whenever a user provides responses to newly presented terms and conditions, this attribute SHALL be updated with the latest responses. This MAY happen in response to updated terms that were presented to the user. On a factory reset this field SHALL be reset with all bits set to 0.

#### TCAcknowledgementsRequired Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate whether [SetTCAcknowledgements](#settcacknowledgements-command) is currently required to be called with the inclusion of mandatory terms accepted.
>
> This attribute MAY be present and False in the case where no terms and conditions are currently mandatory to accept for [CommissioningComplete](#commissioningcomplete-command) to succeed.
>
> This attribute MAY appear, or become True after commissioning (e.g. due to a firmware update) to indicate that new Terms & Conditions are available that the user must accept.
>
> Upon Factory Data Reset, this attribute SHALL be set to a value of True.
>
> When [Custom Commissioning Flow](#custom-commissioning-flow) is used to obtain user consent (e.g. because the Commissioner does not support the TC feature), the manufacturer-provided means for obtaining user consent SHALL ensure that this attribute is set to False before returning the user back to the original Com­ missioner (see [Enhanced Setup Flow](#enhanced-setup-flow-esf)).

#### TCUpdateDeadline Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate the System Time in seconds when any functionality limitations will begin due to a lack of acceptance of updated Terms and Conditions, as described in [Section 5.7.4.5,](#presenting-updated-terms-and-conditions) [“Presenting Updated Terms and Conditions”](#presenting-updated-terms-and-conditions).
>
> A null value indicates that there is no pending deadline for updated TC acceptance.

### Commands

> For all client-to-server commands in this cluster, if the client deems that it has timed-out in receiv­ ing the corresponding response command to any request, the corresponding step in the commis­ sioning flow SHALL be considered to have failed, with the error handled as described in [Section](#commissioning-flows-error-handling) [5.5.1, “Commissioning Flows Error Handling”](#commissioning-flows-error-handling).

#### Common fields in General Commissioning cluster responses

> Some response commands have a DebugText argument which SHOULD NOT be presented directly in user interfaces. Its purpose is to help developers in troubleshooting errors. The value MAY go into logs or crash reports.

#### ArmFailSafe Command

> The arguments for this command are as follows:

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **ExpiryLengt hSeconds** | uint16 |  |  | 900 | M |
| 1 | **Bread­ crumb** | uint64 |  |  |  | M |

> Success or failure of this command SHALL be communicated by the [ArmFailSafeResponse](#armfailsaferesponse-command) com­ mand, unless some data model validations caused a failure status code to be issued during the pro­ cessing of the command.
>
> If the [fail-safe timer](#armfailsafe-command) is not currently armed, the commissioning window is open, and the command was received over a [CASE](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case) session, the command SHALL leave the current fail-safe state unchanged and immediately respond with an [ArmFailSafeResponse](#armfailsaferesponse-command) containing an ErrorCode value of [Busy­](#_bookmark1387) [WithOtherAdmin](#_bookmark1387). This is done to allow commissioners, which use PASE connections, the opportu­ nity to use the failsafe during the relatively short commissioning window.
>
> Otherwise, the command SHALL arm or re-arm the "fail-safe timer" with an expiry time set for a duration of ExpiryLengthSeconds, or disarm it, depending on the situation:

- If ExpiryLengthSeconds is 0 and the fail-safe timer was already armed and the [accessing fabric](#_bookmark691) matches the Fabric currently associated with the fail-safe context, then the fail-safe timer SHALL be immediately expired (see further below for side-effects of expiration).

- If ExpiryLengthSeconds is 0 and the fail-safe timer was not armed, then this command invoca­

> tion SHALL lead to a success response with no side-effects against the fail-safe context.

- If ExpiryLengthSeconds is non-zero and the fail-safe timer was not currently armed, then the fail-safe timer SHALL be armed for that duration.

- If ExpiryLengthSeconds is non-zero and the fail-safe timer was currently armed, and the [access­](#_bookmark691) [ing Fabric](#_bookmark691) matches the fail-safe context’s associated Fabric, then the fail-safe timer SHALL be re- armed to expire in ExpiryLengthSeconds.

- Otherwise, the command SHALL leave the current fail-safe state unchanged and immediately respond with [ArmFailSafeResponse](#armfailsaferesponse-command) containing an ErrorCode value of [BusyWithOtherAdmin](#_bookmark1387), indicating a likely conflict between commissioners.

> The value of the Breadcrumb field SHALL be written to the [Breadcrumb](#breadcrumb-attribute) on successful execution of the command.
>
> If the receiver restarts unexpectedly (e.g., power interruption, software crash, or other reset) the receiver SHALL behave as if the fail-safe timer expired and perform the sequence of clean-up steps listed below.
>
> On successful execution of the command, the ErrorCode field of the [ArmFailSafeResponse](#armfailsaferesponse-command) SHALL be set to OK.
>
> **Fail Safe Context**
>
> When first arming the fail-safe timer, a 'Fail Safe Context' SHALL be created on the receiver, to track the following state information while the fail-safe is armed:

- The fail-safe timer duration.

- The state of all Network Commissioning [Networks](#networks-attribute) attribute configurations, to allow recovery of connectivity after Fail-Safe expiry.

- Whether an [AddNOC command](#addnoc-command) or [UpdateNOC](#updatenoc-command) command has taken place.

- A [Fabric Index](#fabric-index-type) for the fabric-scoping of the context, starting at the [accessing fabric index](#_bookmark691) for the ArmFailSafe command, and updated with the Fabric Index associated with an [AddNOC com­](#addnoc-command) [mand](#addnoc-command) or an [UpdateNOC](#updatenoc-command) command being invoked successfully during the ongoing Fail-Safe timer period.

- The operational credentials associated with any Fabric whose configuration is affected by the [UpdateNOC](#updatenoc-command) command.

- Optionally: the previous state of non-fabric-scoped data that is mutated during the fail-safe period.

> Note the following to assist in understanding the above state-keeping, which summarizes other nor­ mative requirements in the respective sections:

- The [AddNOC command](#addnoc-command) can only be invoked once per contiguous non-expiring fail-safe timer period, and only if no UpdateNOC command was previously processed within the same fail-safe timer period.

- The [UpdateNOC command](#updatenoc-command) can only be invoked once per contiguous non-expiring fail-safe timer period, can only be invoked over a [CASE](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case) session, and only if no AddNOC command was previ­

> ously processed in the same fail-safe timer period.
>
> On creation of the Fail Safe Context a second timer SHALL be created to expire at MaxCumulative­ FailsafeSeconds as specified in [BasicCommissioningInfo](#basiccommissioninginfo-type). This Cumulative Fail Safe Context timer (CFSC timer) serves to limit the lifetime of any particular Fail Safe Context; it SHALL NOT be extended or modified on subsequent invocations of ArmFailSafe associated with this Fail Safe Con­ text. Upon expiry of the CFSC timer, the receiver SHALL execute cleanup behavior equivalent to that of fail-safe timer expiration as detailed in [Section 11.10.7.2.2, “Behavior on expiry of Fail-Safe](#_bookmark1408) [timer”](#_bookmark1408). Termination of the session prior to the expiration of that timer for any reason (including a successful end of commissioning or an expiry of a fail-safe timer) SHALL also delete the CFSC timer.
>
> **Behavior on expiry of Fail-Safe timer**
>
> If the fail-safe timer expires before the [CommissioningComplete](#commissioningcomplete-command) command is successfully invoked, the following sequence of clean-up steps SHALL be executed, in order, by the receiver:

1.  Terminate any open [PASE](#passcode-authenticated-session-establishment-pase) secure session by clearing any associated [Secure Session Context](#secure-session-context) at the Server.

2.  Revoke the temporary administrative privileges granted to any open [PASE](#passcode-authenticated-session-establishment-pase) session (see [Section](#bootstrapping-of-the-access-control-cluster) [6.6.2.9, “Bootstrapping of the Access Control Cluster”](#bootstrapping-of-the-access-control-cluster)) at the Server.

3.  If an AddNOC or UpdateNOC command has been successfully invoked, terminate all [CASE](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case) ses­ sions associated with the Fabric whose Fabric Index is recorded in the Fail-Safe context (see [ArmFailSafe](#armfailsafe-command)) by clearing any associated [Secure Session Context](#secure-session-context) at the Server.

4.  Reset the configuration of all Network Commissioning [Networks](#networks-attribute) attribute to their state prior to the Fail-Safe being armed.

5.  If an UpdateNOC command had been successfully invoked, revert the state of operational key pair, NOC and ICAC for that Fabric to the state prior to the Fail-Safe timer being armed, for the Fabric Index that was the subject of the UpdateNOC command.

6.  If an AddNOC command had been successfully invoked, achieve the equivalent effect of invok­ ing the [RemoveFabric command](#removefabric-command) against the [Fabric Index](#fabric-index-type) stored in the Fail-Safe Context for the Fabric Index that was the subject of the AddNOC command. This SHALL remove all associations to that Fabric including all fabric-scoped data, and MAY possibly factory-reset the device depending on current device state. This SHALL only apply to Fabrics added during the fail-safe period as the result of the [AddNOC command](#addnoc-command).

7.  If the [CSRRequest](#csrrequest-command) command had been successfully invoked, but no AddNOC or UpdateNOC com­ mand had been successfully invoked, then the new operational key pair temporarily generated for the purposes of NOC addition or update (see [Node Operational CSR Procedure](#node-operational-certificate-signing-request-nocsr-procedure)) SHALL be removed as it is no longer needed.

8.  Remove any RCACs added by the [AddTrustedRootCertificate command](#addtrustedrootcertificate-command) that are not currently referenced by any entry in the [Fabrics attribute](#fabrics-attribute).

9.  Reset the [Breadcrumb](#breadcrumb-attribute) attribute to zero.

10. Optionally: if no factory-reset resulted from the previous steps, it is RECOMMENDED that the Node rollback the state of all non fabric-scoped data present in the Fail-Safe context.

#### CommissioningComplete Command

> This command has no data.
>
> Success or failure of this command SHALL be communicated by the [CommissioningCompleteRe­](#commissioningcompleteresponse-command) [sponse](#commissioningcompleteresponse-command) command, unless some data model validations caused a failure status code to be issued dur­ ing the processing of the command.
>
> This command signals the Server that the Commissioner or Administrator has successfully com­ pleted all steps needed during the Fail-Safe period, such as commissioning (see [Section 5.5, “Com­](#commissioning-flows) [missioning Flows”](#commissioning-flows)) or other Administrator operations requiring usage of the Fail Safe timer. It ensures that the Server is configured in a state such that it still has all necessary elements to be fully operable within a Fabric, such as ACL entries (see [Section 9.10, “Access Control Cluster”](#access-control-cluster)) and operational credentials (see [Section 6.4, “Node Operational Credentials Specification”](#node-operational-credentials-specification)), and that the Node is reachable using CASE (see [Section 4.14.2, “Certificate Authenticated Session Establishment](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case)
>
> [(CASE)”](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case)) over an operational network.
>
> An ErrorCode of [NoFailSafe](#_bookmark1386) SHALL be responded to the invoker if the CommissioningComplete command was received when no [Fail-Safe context](#armfailsafe-command) exists.
>
> If [Terms and Conditions](#terms-and-conditions-tc-acknowledgement) are required, then an ErrorCode of [TCAcknowledgementsNotReceived](#_bookmark1389) SHALL be responded to the invoker if the user acknowledgements to the required Terms and Con­ ditions have not been provided. If the [TCAcceptedVersion](#tcacceptedversion-attribute) for the provided acknowledgements is less than [TCMinRequiredVersion](#tcminrequiredversion-attribute), then an ErrorCode of [TCMinVersionNotMet](#_bookmark1390) SHALL be responded to the invoker.
>
> This command is fabric-scoped, so cannot be issued over a session that does not have an associated fabric, i.e. over PASE session prior to an AddNOC command. In addition, this command is only per­ mitted over CASE and must be issued by a node associated with the ongoing Fail-Safe context. An ErrorCode of [InvalidAuthentication](#_bookmark1385) SHALL be responded to the invoker if the CommissioningCom­ plete command was received outside a [CASE](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case) session (e.g., over Group messaging, or [PASE](#passcode-authenticated-session-establishment-pase) session after AddNOC), or if the accessing fabric is not the one associated with the ongoing Fail-Safe con­ text.
>
> This command SHALL only result in success with an ErrorCode value of OK in the [Commissioning­](#commissioningcompleteresponse-command) [CompleteResponse](#commissioningcompleteresponse-command) if received over a [CASE](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case) session and the [accessing fabric index](#_bookmark691) matches the Fab­ ric Index associated with the current Fail-Safe context. In other words:

- If no AddNOC command had been successfully invoked, the CommissioningComplete command must originate from the Fabric that initiated the Fail-Safe context.

- After an AddNOC command has been successfully invoked, the CommissioningComplete com­ mand must originate from the Fabric which was joined through the execution of that command, which updated the Fail-Safe context’s Fabric Index.

> On successful execution of the CommissioningComplete command, where the CommissioningCom­ pleteResponse has an ErrorCode of OK, the following actions SHALL be undertaken on the Server:

1.  The [Fail-Safe timer](#armfailsafe-command) associated with the current Fail-Safe context SHALL be disarmed.

2.  The commissioning window at the Server SHALL be closed.

3.  Any temporary administrative privileges automatically granted to any open [PASE](#passcode-authenticated-session-establishment-pase) session SHALL be revoked (see [Section 6.6.2.9, “Bootstrapping of the Access Control Cluster”](#bootstrapping-of-the-access-control-cluster)).

4.  The [Secure Session Context](#secure-session-context) of any [PASE](#passcode-authenticated-session-establishment-pase) session still established at the Server SHALL be cleared.

5.  The [Breadcrumb](#breadcrumb-attribute) attribute SHALL be reset to zero.

> After receipt of a CommissioningCompleteResponse with an ErrorCode value of OK, a client cannot expect any previously established [PASE](#passcode-authenticated-session-establishment-pase) session to still be usable, due to the server having cleared such sessions.

#### RetrieveLogsRequest Command

> Reception of this command starts the process of retrieving diagnostic logs from a Node. The data for this command is as follows:

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **Intent** | [IntentEnum](#intentenum-type) | all |  |  | M |
| 1 | **Requested­ Protocol** | [TransferPro­](#transferprotocolenum-type) [tocolEnum](#transferprotocolenum-type) | all |  |  | M |
| 2 | **Transfer­ FileDesigna­ tor** | [string](#character-string-type) | max 32 |  |  | O |

> **Intent Field**
>
> This field SHALL indicate why the diagnostic logs are being retrieved from the Node. A Node MAY utilize this field to selectively determine the logs to transfer.
>
> **RequestedProtocol Field**
>
> This field SHALL be used to indicate how the log transfer is to be realized. If the field is set to BDX, then if the receiving Node supports BDX it SHALL attempt to use BDX to transfer any potential diag­ nostic logs; if the receiving Node does not support BDX then the Node SHALL follow the require­ ments defined for a TransferProtocolEnum of ResponsePayload. If this field is set to ResponsePay­ load the receiving Node SHALL only utilize the [LogContent](#_bookmark1426) field of the RetrieveLogsResponse com­ mand to transfer diagnostic log information.
>
> **TransferFileDesignator Field**
>
> This field SHALL be present if the RequestedProtocol is BDX. The TransferFileDesignator SHALL be set as the [File Designator](#_bookmark1712) of the BDX transfer if initiated.
>
> **Effect on Receipt**
>
> On receipt of this command, the Node SHALL respond with a RetrieveLogsResponse command.
>
> If the RequestedProtocol is set to BDX the Node SHOULD immediately realize the RetrieveLogsRe­ sponse command by initiating a [BDX Transfer](#bulk-data-exchange-protocol-bdx), sending a [BDX SendInit](#_bookmark1700) message with the File Desig­ nator field of the message set to the value of the TransferFileDesignator field of the RetrieveLogsRe­ quest. On reception of a [BDX SendAccept](#sendaccept-message) message the Node SHALL send a RetrieveLogsResponse command with a Status field set to Success and proceed with the log transfer over BDX. If a failure StatusReport is received in response to the SendInit message, the Node SHALL send a RetrieveL­ ogsResponse command with a Status of Denied. In the case where the Node is able to fit the entirety of the requested logs within the [LogContent](#_bookmark1426) field, the Status field of the RetrieveLogsResponse SHALL be set to Exhausted and a BDX session SHALL NOT be initiated.
>
> If the RequestedProtocol is set to BDX and either the Node does not support BDX or it is not possible for the Node to establish a BDX session, then the Node SHALL utilize the [LogContent](#_bookmark1426) field of the RetrieveLogsResponse command to transfer as much of the current logs as it can fit within the response, and the Status field of the RetrieveLogsResponse SHALL be set to Exhausted.
>
> If the RequestedProtocol is set to ResponsePayload the Node SHALL utilize the [LogContent](#_bookmark1426) field of the RetrieveLogsResponse command to transfer as much of the current logs as it can fit within the response, and a BDX session SHALL NOT be initiated.
>
> If the RequestedProtocol is set to BDX and there is no TransferFileDesignator the command SHALL fail with a Status Code of INVALID_COMMAND.
>
> If the Intent and/or the RequestedProtocol arguments contain invalid (out of range) values the com­ mand SHALL fail with a Status Code of INVALID_COMMAND.

#### RetrieveLogsResponse Command

> This SHALL be generated as a response to the RetrieveLogsRequest. The data for this command is shown in the following.

| 3 | **TimeSince­ Boot** | [system-us](#system-time-in-microseconds-type) | all |  |  | O |

> **Status Field**
>
> This field SHALL indicate the result of an attempt to retrieve diagnostic logs.
>
> **LogContent Field**
>
> This field SHALL be included in the command if the Status field has a value of Success or Exhausted. A Node SHOULD utilize this field to transfer the newest diagnostic log entries. This field SHALL be empty if BDX is requested and the Status field has a value of Success.
>
> **UTCTimeStamp Field**
>
> This field SHOULD be included in the command if the Status field has a value of Success and the Node maintains a wall clock. When included, the UTCTimeStamp field SHALL contain the value of the oldest log entry in the diagnostic logs that are being transferred.
>
> **TimeSinceBoot Field**
>
> This field SHOULD be included in the command if the Status field has a value of Success. When included, the TimeSinceBoot field SHALL contain the time of the oldest log entry in the diagnostic logs that are being transferred represented by the number of microseconds since the last time the Node went through a reboot.

## General Diagnostics Cluster

When the Node detects a fault has been raised, the appropriate [RadioFaultEnum](#radiofaultenum-type) value SHALL be added to this list. This list SHALL NOT contain more than one instance of a specific [RadioFaultEnum](#radiofaultenum-type) value. When the Node detects that all conditions contributing to a fault has been cleared, the corre­ sponding [RadioFaultEnum](#radiofaultenum-type) value SHALL be removed from this list. An empty list SHALL indicate there are currently no active faults. The order of this list SHOULD have no significance. Clients interested in monitoring changes in active faults MAY subscribe to this attribute, or they MAY sub­ scribe to [RadioFaultChange](#radiofaultchange-event).

#### ActiveNetworkFaults Attribute

> The ActiveNetworkFaults attribute SHALL indicate the set of faults currently detected by the Node.

> **EnableKey Field**
>
> The EnableKey is a 128 bit value provided by the client in this command, which needs to match a value chosen by the manufacturer and configured on the server using manufacturer-specific means, such as pre-provisioning. The value of all zeroes is reserved to indicate that no EnableKey is set. Therefore, if the EnableKey field is received with all zeroes, this command SHALL FAIL with a response status of CONSTRAINT_ERROR.
>
> The EnableKey SHOULD be unique per exact set of devices going to a certification test.
>
> Devices not targeted towards going to a certification test event SHALL NOT have a non-zero EnableKey value configured, so that only devices in test environments are responsive to this com­ mand.
>
> In order to prevent unwittingly actuating a particular trigger, this command SHALL respond with a response status of CONSTRAINT_ERROR if the EnableKey field does not match the a-priori value configured on the device.
>
> **EventTrigger Field**
>
> This field SHALL indicate the test or test mode which the client wants to trigger.

> The expected side-effects of EventTrigger values are out of scope of this specification and will be described within appropriate certification test literature provided to manufacturers by the Connec­ tivity Standards Alliance, in conjunction with certification test cases documentation.
>
> Values of EventTrigger in the range 0xFFFF_FFFF_0000_0000 through 0xFFFF_FFFF_FFFF_FFFF are reserved for testing use by manufacturers and will not appear in CSA certification test literature.
>
> If the value of EventTrigger received is not supported by the receiving Node, this command SHALL
>
> fail with a status code of INVALID_COMMAND.
>
> Otherwise, if the EnableKey value matches the configured internal value for a particular Node, and the EventTrigger value matches a supported test event trigger value, the command SHALL succeed and execute the expected trigger action.
>
> If no specific test event triggers are required to be supported by certification test requirements for the features that a given product will be certified against, this command MAY always fail with the INVALID_COMMAND status, equivalent to the situation of receiving an unknown EventTrigger, for all possible EventTrigger values.

#### TimeSnapshot Command

> This command MAY be used by a client to obtain a correlated view of both System Time, and, if cur­ rently synchronized and supported, "wall clock time" of the server. This can help clients establish time correlation between their concept of time and the server’s concept of time. This is especially useful when processing event histories where some events only contain System Time.
>
> Upon command invocation, the server SHALL respond with a TimeSnapshotResponse.

#### TimeSnapshotResponse Command

> This command SHALL be generated in response to a TimeSnapshot command.
>
> When generating this response, all fields SHALL be gathered as close together in time as possible, so that the time jitter between the values is minimized.
>
> If the Time Synchronization cluster is supported by the node, the PosixTimeMs field SHALL NOT be null unless the [UTCTime](#utctime-attribute) attribute in the [Time Synchronization](#time-synchronization-cluster) cluster is also null.

> **SystemTimeMs Field**
>
> This SHALL indicate the current System Time in milliseconds (type [system-ms](#system-time-in-milliseconds-type)), with the value taken at the time of processing of the TimeSnapshot command that generated this response.
>
> The value SHALL be taken from the same clock which populates the [Timestamp field](#systemtimestamp-and-epochtimestamp-fields) in events when using System Time for the field.
>
> **PosixTimeMs Field**
>
> This SHALL indicate the current time in [POSIX Time in milliseconds](#posix-time-in-milliseconds-type), with the value taken from the same source that could populate the [Timestamp field of events](#systemtimestamp-and-epochtimestamp-fields). This value SHALL only be null when any the following are true:

- The node doesn’t support the Time Synchronization cluster.

- The node’s Time Synchronization cluster instance’s UTCTime attribute is null.

#### PayloadTestRequest Command

> This command provides a means for certification tests or manufacturer’s internal tests to validate particular command handling and encoding constraints by generating a response of a given size.
>
> This command SHALL use the same EnableKey behavior as the [TestEventTrigger command](#testeventtrigger-command), whereby processing of the command is only enabled when the TestEventTriggersEnabled field is true, which SHALL NOT be true outside of certification testing or manufacturer’s internal tests.
>
> The fields for the PayloadTestRequest command are as follows:

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0x00 | **EnableKey** | [octstr](#octet-string-type) | 16 |  |  | M |
| 0x01 | **Value** | uint8 |  |  |  | M |
| 0x02 | **Count** | uint16 | max 2048 |  |  | M |

> **EnableKey field**
>
> This field SHALL have the same meaning and usage as the [TestEventTrigger EnableKey field](#_bookmark1443).
>
> **Value field**
>
> This field SHALL indicate the value to use in every byte of the PayloadTestResponse’s Payload field.
>
> **Count field**
>
> This field SHALL indicate the number of times to repeat the Value in the PayloadTestResponse’s Payload field.
>
> **Effect upon receipt**
>
> This command SHALL respond with a response status of CONSTRAINT_ERROR if either:

- The EnableKey field does not match the a-priori value configured on the device.

- The TestEventTriggersEnabled field is currently false.

> Otherwise, the server SHALL respond with a PayloadTestResponse command with a Payload field value containing Count instances of the Value byte. If the response is too large to send, the server SHALL fail the command and respond with a response status of RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED.
>
> For example:

- If Value is 0x55 and the Count is zero, then the PayloadTestResponse would have the Payload field set to an empty octet string.

- If Value is 0xA5 and the Count is 10, the PayloadTestResponse would have the Payload field set

> to a content whose hexadecimal representation would be A5A5A5A5A5A5A5A5A5A5, and base64 rep­ resentation would be paWlpaWlpaWlpQ==.

#### PayloadTestResponse Command

> This command is sent by the server on receipt of the PayloadTestRequest command. This command SHALL have the following data fields:

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |

[TABLE]

#### UTCTime Attribute

> If the node has achieved time synchronization, this SHALL indicate the current time as a UTC [epoch-us](#epoch-time-in-microseconds-type) (Epoch Time in Microseconds).
>
> If the node has not achieved time synchronization, this SHALL be null. This attribute MAY be set when a [SetUTCTime](#setutctime-command) is received.

#### Granularity Attribute

> The granularity of the error that the node is willing to guarantee on the time synchronization. It is of type [GranularityEnum](#granularityenum-type).
>
> This value SHALL be set to NoTimeGranularity if UTCTime is null and SHALL NOT be set to NoTime­ Granularity if UTCTime is non-null.

#### TimeSource Attribute

> The node’s time source. This attribute indicates what method the node is using to sync, whether the source uses NTS or not and whether the source is internal or external to the Matter network. This attribute MAY be used by a client to determine its level of trust in the UTCTime. It is of type [Time­](#timesourceenum-type) [SourceEnum](#timesourceenum-type).
>
> If a node is unsure if the selected NTP server is within the Matter network, it SHOULD select one of the NonMatter\* values.
>
> This value SHALL be set to None if UTCTime is null and SHALL NOT be set to None if UTCTime is non-null.

#### TrustedTimeSource Attribute

> A Node ID, endpoint, and associated [fabric index](#fabric-index) of a Node that MAY be used as trusted time source. See [Section 11.17.13, “Time source prioritization”](#time-source-prioritization). This attribute reflects the last value set by an administrator using the [SetTrustedTimeSource](#settrustedtimesource-command) command. If the value is null, no trusted time source has yet been set.

#### DefaultNTP Attribute

> The default NTP server that this Node MAY use if other time sources are unavailable. This attribute is settable by an Administrator using the [SetDefaultNTP](#setdefaultntp-command) command. It SHOULD be set by the Com­ missioner during commissioning. If no default NTP server is available, the Commissioner MAY set this value to null. The default IANA assigned NTP port of 123 SHALL be used to access the NTP server.
>
> If set, the format of this attribute SHALL be a domain name or a static IPv6 address with no port, in text format, as specified in [RFC 5952](#_bookmark59). The address format SHALL follow the recommendations in Section 4 and SHALL NOT contain a port number.

#### TimeZone Attribute

> A list of time zone offsets from UTC and when they SHALL take effect. This attribute uses a list of time offset configurations to allow Nodes to handle scheduled regulatory time zone changes. This attribute SHALL NOT be used to indicate daylight savings time changes (see [DSTOffset](#dstoffset-attribute) attribute for daylight savings time).
>
> The first entry SHALL have a ValidAt entry of 0. If there is a second entry, it SHALL have a non-zero ValidAt time.
>
> If a node supports a [TimeZoneDatabase](#timezonedatabase-attribute), and it has data for the given time zone Name and the given Offset matches, the node MAY update its own [DSTOffset](#dstoffset-attribute) attribute to add new DST change times as required, based on the Name fields of the TimeZoneStruct. Administrators MAY add additional entries to the DSTOffset of other Nodes with the same time zone, if required.
>
> If a node does not support a [TimeZoneDatabase](#timezonedatabase-attribute), the Name field of the [TimeZoneStruct](#timezonestruct-type) is only applicable for client-side localization. In particular:

- If the node does not support a [TimeZoneDatabase](#timezonedatabase-attribute), the Name field SHALL NOT be used to calcu­

> late the local time.

- If the node does not support a [TimeZoneDatabase](#timezonedatabase-attribute), the Name field SHALL NOT be used to calcu­ late DST start or end dates.

> When time passes, the node SHOULD remove any entries which are no longer active and change the ValidAt time for the currently used TimeZoneStruct list item to zero.
>
> This attribute SHALL have at least one entry. If the node does not have a default time zone and no time zone has been set, it MAY set this value to a list containing a single [TimeZoneStruct](#timezonestruct-type) with an off­ set of 0 (UTC) and a ValidAt time of 0.

#### DSTOffset Attribute

> A list of offsets to apply for daylight savings time, and their validity period. List entries SHALL be sorted by ValidStarting time.
>
> A list entry SHALL NOT have a ValidStarting time that is smaller than the ValidUntil time of the pre­ vious entry. There SHALL be at most one list entry with a null ValidUntil time and, if such an entry is present, it SHALL appear last in the list.
>
> Over time, the node SHOULD remove any entries which are no longer active from the list.
>
> Over time, if the node supports a [TimeZoneDatabase](#timezonedatabase-attribute) and it has information available for the given time zone name, it MAY update its own list to add additional entries.
>
> If a time zone does not use DST, this SHALL be indicated by a single entry with a 0 offset and a null ValidUntil field.

#### LocalTime Attribute

> The computed current local time of the node as a [epoch-us](#epoch-time-in-microseconds-type) (Epoch Time in Microseconds). The value of LocalTime SHALL be the sum of the [UTCTime](#utctime-attribute), the offset of the currently valid [TimeZon­](#timezonestruct-type) [eStruct](#timezonestruct-type) from the [TimeZone](#timezone-attribute) attribute (converted to microseconds), and the offset of the currently valid [DSTOffsetStruct](#dstoffsetstruct-type) from the [DSTOffset](#dstoffset-attribute) attribute (converted to microseconds), if such an entry exists.
>
> If the node has not achieved time synchronization, this SHALL be null. If the node has an empty DSTOffset, this SHALL be null.

#### TimeZoneDatabase Attribute

> Indicates whether the node has access to a time zone database. Nodes with a time zone database MAY update their own [DSTOffset](#dstoffset-attribute) attribute to add new entries and MAY push DSTOffset updates to other Nodes in the same time zone as required.

#### NTPServerAvailable Attribute

> If the node is running an [RFC 5905](#_bookmark58) NTPv4 compliant server on port 123, this value SHALL be True. If the node is not currently running an NTP server, this value SHALL be False.

#### TimeZoneListMaxSize Attribute

> Number of supported list entries in the [TimeZone](#timezone-attribute) attribute. This attribute may take the value of 1 or 2, where the optional second list entry MAY be used to handle scheduled regulatory time zone changes.

#### DSTOffsetListMaxSize Attribute

> Number of supported list entries in [DSTOffset](#dstoffset-attribute) attribute. This value must be at least 1.

#### SupportsDNSResolve Attribute

> This attribute is true if the node supports resolving a domain name. DefaultNTP Address values for these nodes MAY include domain names. If this is False, the Address for a DefaultNTP SHALL be an IPv6 address.

This event SHALL also be generated if the DSTOffset list is cleared either by a [SetTimeZone](#settimezone-command) command, or by a [SetDSTOffset](#setdstoffset-command) command with an empty list.
>
> The node SHALL generate this event if the node has not generated a DSTTableEmpty event in the last hour, and the DSTOffset list is empty when the node attempts to update its time. DST­ TableEmpty events corresponding to a time update SHOULD NOT be generated more often than once per hour.
>
> There is no data for this event.

#### DSTStatus Event

> This event SHALL be generated when the node starts or stops applying a DST offset.

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **DSTOffse­ tActive** | bool |  |  |  | M |

> **DSTOffsetActive Field**
>
> Indicates whether the current DST offset is being applied (i.e, daylight savings time is applied, as opposed to standard time).

#### TimeZoneStatus Event

> This event SHALL be generated when the node changes its time zone offset or name. It SHALL NOT be sent for DST changes that are not accompanied by a time zone change.

[TABLE]

> **Offset Field**
>
> Current time zone offset from UTC in seconds.
>
> **Name Field**
>
> Current time zone name. This name SHOULD use the country/city format specified by the [IANA Time Zone Database](#_bookmark26).

#### TimeFailure Event

> This event SHALL be generated if the node has not generated a TimeFailure event in the last hour, and the node is unable to get a time from any source. This event SHOULD NOT be generated more often than once per hour.

#### MissingTrustedTimeSource Event

> This event SHALL be generated if the TrustedTimeSource is set to null upon fabric removal or by a [SetTrustedTimeSource](#settrustedtimesource-command) command.
>
> This event SHALL also be generated if the node has not generated a MissingTrustedTimeSource event in the last hour, and the node fails to update its time from the TrustedTimeSource because the TrustedTimeSource is null or the specified peer cannot be reached. MissingTrustedTimeSource events corresponding to a time update SHOULD NOT be generated more often than once per hour.

### Time Synchronization at Commissioning

> During commissioning the Commissioner SHOULD set the UTCTime, and set up the TrustedTime­ Source, DefaultNTP, TimeZone and DSTOffsets as required. Please see [Commissioning Flows](#_bookmark537). Note that the commissioner MAY opt to not set the time so the node SHOULD NOT depend on having time during commissioning.

### Time Synchronization during operation

> Nodes MAY perform time synchronization using a trusted external source, [RFC 5905](#_bookmark58) or by reading the UTC time from the Time Synchronization cluster of another Node with the desired Granularity and TimeSource. When using NTPv4 / SNTPv4, Nodes capable of external communication SHOULD use network time security (NTS) if that is available on the server ([RFC 8915](#_bookmark74)). This specification DOES NOT mandate that Nodes should include a TCP/TLS stack and a set of adequate Root CA cer­ tificates solely to support NTS, but that if a Node already has these capabilities, then it SHOULD implement and attempt NTS for NTP.
>
> Nodes SHOULD attempt to perform a time synchronization after a restart or upon any change of Node state where timekeeping was lost. Nodes SHOULD attempt this time synchronization prior to using any security material which may have expired. If a Node is unable to achieve time synchro­ nization using the steps outlined in [Section 11.17.13, “Time source prioritization”](#time-source-prioritization), the Node MAY retry or fall back to the stored Last Known Good UTC Time ([Section 3.5.6.1, “Last Known Good UTC](#last-known-good-utc-time) [Time”](#last-known-good-utc-time)).
>
> Since Matter does not mandate external network connectivity for use, device manufacturers should be aware that it is possible to be operating in a network where time is not available from any source. Product manufacturers may wish to account for this possibility when specifying their clock drift requirements. The estimated clock drift is reported using the [Granularity](#granularity-attribute) attribute.

### Time source prioritization

> Nodes SHALL prioritize time synchronization sources in the following order:

1.  GNSS time source, if supported by the Node.

2.  Trusted, high-resolution, external time source (ex. PTP, network NTP, trusted cloud-based source), if supported by the Node and external connectivity is available.

3.  If NTPClient (NTPC) feature is supported: NTP server defined in the DHCPv6 NTP server option, if DHCPv6 is supported on the Node.

4.  If NTPClient (NTPC) feature is supported: NTP server defined by DHCP if the Node supports IPv4.

5.  If NTPClient (NTPC) feature is supported: NTP server identified by a DNS-SD query for

> \_ntp.\_udp. If multiple servers respond, Nodes with full NTP support SHOULD query multiple servers. Nodes using SNTP SHOULD select any server from the list.

6.  If TimeSyncClient (TSC) feature is supported: the Time Synchronization cluster of another Node SHOULD be queried in the following order:

    1.  TrustedTimeSource provided by an Administrator.

    2.  Any of the Node’s current peers per any data model binding that support the Time Synchro­ nization cluster and have the desired Granularity and TimeSource.

    3.  Enumerate all Nodes using DNS-SD query for \_matter.\_tcp and select a peer that supports the Time Synchronization cluster and has the desired Granularity and TimeSource.

7.  If NTPClient (NTPC) feature is supported: Fallback NTP server defined during commissioning.

> Nodes that use GNSS or a trusted external source SHOULD check the remaining time synchroniza­ tion sources to determine if they SHOULD act as an NTP server (see [Section 11.17.15, “Acting as an](#acting-as-an-ntp-server) [NTP Server”](#acting-as-an-ntp-server)).

### Time synchronization maintenance

> Nodes SHALL adjust their Granularity attribute based on their assessed time synchronization error. Nodes running an NTP server ([Section 11.17.15, “Acting as an NTP Server”](#acting-as-an-ntp-server)) SHALL maintain a Gran­ ularity of SecondsGranularity or better and SHOULD maintain an accuracy of MillisecondsGranu­ larity or better.
>
> A Node with a Granularity of NoTimeGranularity SHALL attempt to sync its time at least once a day. Nodes SHOULD NOT query the Time Synchronization cluster of another Node more than once per 30 minutes.

### Acting as an NTP Server

> Any capable Node with always-on power source that has and can maintain a time synchronization Granularity of MillisecondsGranularity or better, SHOULD act as an NTP server. Any capable Node that reaches the final stage in the [Section 11.17.13, “Time source prioritization”](#time-source-prioritization) mechanism SHOULD act as an NTP server for the network.
>
> A Node hosting an NTP server SHALL update the NTPServerAvailable attribute and SHOULD adver­ tise an \_ntp.\_udp DNS-SD service. A Node hosting an NTP server SHOULD support network time security (NTS). A Node hosting an NTP server SHOULD implement leap smearing.

### Implementation Guidance

> This specification offers several options for getting time in order to support Nodes with various capabilities. This section is not intended as a requirement, but is used to illustrate how various Nodes might implement this specification.

#### Example: Constrained Node with no schedule capabilities

> This type of Node would not need to support the TimeZone (TZ) feature or the NTPServer (NTPS) feature. A constrained node can choose to get time either by using a time synchronization client cluster to read the time from a trusted node (if the TSC feature is supported), and / or by using the NTPClient (if the NTPC feature is supported). A constrained node supporting NTPC would likely use an SNTP implementation.
>
> A node supporting both the NTPC and TSC features would have the following attributes:

- UTCTime

- Granularity

- TimeSource (optional)

- TrustedTimeSource

- DefaultNTP

> To achieve time synchronization, the Node would start at Step 3 of [Section 11.17.13, “Time source](#time-source-prioritization) [prioritization”](#time-source-prioritization) (Steps 1 and 2 do not apply).
>
> If the Node opts to support only the TSC feature, it would have the following attributes:

- UTCTime

- Granularity

- TimeSource (optional)

- TrustedTimeSource

> To achieve time synchronization, the Node would start at step 6 (querying a Time Synchronization cluster) of [Section 11.17.13, “Time source prioritization”](#time-source-prioritization) (other steps do not apply).
>
> If the Node opts to support only the NTPC feature, it would have the following attributes:

- UTCTime

- Granularity

- TimeSource (optional)

- DefaultNTP

> To achieve time synchronization, the Node would start at step 3 of [Section 11.17.13, “Time source](#time-source-prioritization) [prioritization”](#time-source-prioritization) and would bypass step 6.
>
> In all cases, if the Node wishes to maintain time synchronization by re-querying, it would set its Granularity attribute as appropriate at each update. This would probably be either Milliseconds­ Granularity or SecondsGranularity depending on the round-trip delay and the frequency of updates. If the Node wishes to use a single time synchronization, but will not continue to synchro­ nize during operation, it may either set the Granularity as appropriate and downgrade as the clock drifts, or may simply opt to set the Granularity to MinutesGranularity. If supported, the TimeSource attribute would be set as appropriate.

#### Example: Intermittently connected device with schedule capability

> This type of Node would need to support the TimeZone (TZ) feature to support scheduling, but would not support the NTPServer (NTPS) feature as it is an intermittently connected device and would not make a reliable server. As with the [Constrained Node with no schedule capabilities](#example-constrained-node-with-no-schedule-capabilities) example, this type of Node can choose to get time either by using the time synchronization client cluster to read the time from a trusted node (if the TSC feature is supported) and / or by using an NTPClient (if the NTPC feature is supported).
>
> This type of Node would support all the attributes described in the [Constrained Node with no](#example-constrained-node-with-no-schedule-capabilities) [schedule capabilities](#example-constrained-node-with-no-schedule-capabilities) example with the appropriate features. Because it additionally supports the TimeZone (TZ) feature, it would also support the following attributes:

- TimeZoneListMaxSize

- TimeZone

- DSTOffsetListMaxSize

- DSTOffset

- LocalTime

- TimeZoneDatabase

> During commissioning, the Node should receive time zone information from the commissioner. If the Node has access to a time zone database, it can opt to fill its own DSTOffset attribute, otherwise it should also receive DSTOffset information from the Commissioner. During operation, this type of Node would use the same methods of getting time as the [Constrained Node with no schedule capa­](#example-constrained-node-with-no-schedule-capabilities) [bilities](#example-constrained-node-with-no-schedule-capabilities) example, setting the Granularity and optional TimeSource as appropriate. It would also use the information from the TimeZone and DSTOffset to calculate a local time.

#### Example: Hub-like Node

> These types of Nodes are normally relatively capable, high-powered and always-on. These would most likely include time zone support for scheduling and display. Often these will have significant software beyond this specification and are likely to already have built-in mechanisms for time syn­ chronization. Such Nodes SHOULD support an NTP server to serve time to other Nodes in the net­ work. This type of Node may opt to support the TimeSyncClient (TSC) and NTPClient (NTPC) as backup, but can omit these if it has a reliable time source. It would support the following attributes based on the supported features:

- UTCTime

- Granularity

- TimeSource (optional)

- TrustedTimeSource (if TSC supported)

- DefaultNTP (if NTPC supported)

- TimeZoneListMaxSize

- TimeZone

- DSTOffsetListMaxSize

  - DSTOffset

  - LocalTime

  - TimeZoneDatabase

  - NTPServerAvailable

> To achieve time synchronization, these Nodes would likely use Step 1 or Step 2 of [Section 11.17.13,](#time-source-prioritization) [“Time source prioritization”](#time-source-prioritization), using the remaining options as fallback if necessary. The Node would then set its Granularity and TimeSource as appropriate, and would maintain its times, Granularity and TimeSource. The Node SHOULD also start an NTP server, update the NTPServerAvailable attribute and advertise using DNS-SD on \_ntp.\_udp.
>
> If a time-zone database is supported (Node can calculate DST times from TimeZone settings), these Nodes MAY subscribe to the DSTTableEmpty Events of Nodes with no TimeZoneDatabase support. Upon receipt of these events the Node SHOULD calculate and set new DST values for such Nodes by writing the DSTOffset attribute. These nodes MAY also subscribe to the TimeFailure and Miss­ ingTrustedTimeSource events for Nodes in its fabric and supply time or time sources as required.

#### AddNOC and UpdateNOC Commands Overview

> The AddNOC command is used to commission a Node into a Fabric by providing a usable [NOC](#node-operational-certificate-noc) and [ICAC](#intermediate-ca-ica-certificate), with associated Node Operational IDs.
>
> The UpdateNOC command is used to update existing credentials within a Fabric, for the purposes of:

- Rotating the Node Operational Key Pair in use

- Updating the contents of the [NOC](#node-operational-certificate-noc) and optionally the [ICAC](#intermediate-ca-ica-certificate) certificates (subjects, issuers, keys, etc) under the current root of trust and Fabric

> Both of these commands receive an NOCValue and optional ICACValue fields and require some com­ mon validation in addition to their specific behavior.
>
> **NOCValue and ICACValue Fields**
>
> The NOCValue and ICACValue fields SHALL be octet strings that represent a certificate encoded using [Matter Certificate Encoding](#matter-certificate).
>
> Upon receipt, the NOCValue and ICACValue chain SHALL be validated in the following ways:

1.  Verify the NOC using:

    1.  [Crypto_VerifyChain(certificates = \[NOCValue, ICACValue, RootCACertificate\])](#certificate-validation) if ICACValue is present,

    2.  [Crypto_VerifyChain(certificates = \[NOCValue, RootCACertificate\])](#certificate-validation) if ICACValue is not present. If this verification fails, the error status SHALL be InvalidNOC.

2.  The public key of the NOC SHALL match the last generated operational public key on this ses­ sion, and therefore the public key present in the last [CSRResponse](#csrresponse-command) provided to the Administra­ tor or Commissioner that sent the [AddNOC](#addnoc-command) or [UpdateNOC](#updatenoc-command) command. If this check fails, the error

> status SHALL be InvalidPublicKey.

3.  The [DN Encoding Rules](#matter-dn-encoding-rules) SHALL be validated for every certificate in the chain, including valid value range checks for identifiers such as Fabric ID and Node ID. If this validation fails, the error status SHALL be InvalidNodeOpId if the matter-node-id attribute in the subject DN of the NOC has a value outside the Operational Node ID range and InvalidNOC for all other failures.

> If any of the above validation checks fail, the server SHALL immediately respond to the client with an [NOCResponse](#nocresponse-command). The StatusCode field of the NOCResponse SHALL be set to the error status value specified in the above validation checks.
>
> These certificate validation steps are performed to ensure that operational credentials installed match an operational key pair generated by the Device and respect the trust model assumptions expressed in [Section 6.4.5.1, “Node Operational Certificate (NOC)”](#node-operational-certificate-noc).
>
> **Handling Errors**
>
> For any error described in the following subsections, the device SHALL immediately respond to the client with an [NOCResponse](#nocresponse-command) with the prescribed StatusCode field, and SHALL leave all non-volatile state of the device untouched, as if the AddNOC command had never been received. The informa­ tion about the last CSR state associated with this session SHALL also be untouched in this case, so that a valid AddNOC command MAY still be issued later that would match that CSR state. The DebugText field in the NOCResponse MAY be filled with debug information.
>
> The following failed preconditions error cases apply to all invocations of AddNOC:

- If the device already has the CommissionedFabrics attribute equal to the SupportedFabrics attribute, then the device’s operational credentials table is considered full and the device SHALL process the error by responding with a StatusCode of [TableFull](#_bookmark1573) as described in [Section](#_bookmark1598) [11.18.6.7.2, “Handling Errors”](#_bookmark1598).

- If no context or memory exists of a prior CSRRequest command having been invoked in the **same secure session** as that which is receiving this AddNOC or UpdateNOC invocation, then the Node SHALL process the error by responding with a StatusCode of [MissingCsr](#_bookmark1572) as described in [Section 11.18.6.7.2, “Handling Errors”](#_bookmark1598).

#### AddNOC Command

> This command SHALL add a new [NOC](#node-operational-certificate-noc) chain to the device and commission a new Fabric association upon successful validation of all arguments and preconditions.
>
> The new value SHALL immediately be reflected in the [NOCs](#nocs-attribute) list attribute.
>
> A Commissioner or Administrator SHALL issue this command after issuing the [CSRRequest com­](#csrrequest-command) [mand](#csrrequest-command) and receiving its response.
>
> A Commissioner or Administrator SHOULD issue this command after performing the [Attestation](#device-attestation-procedure) [Procedure](#device-attestation-procedure).

> **IPKValue Field**
>
> This field SHALL contain the value of the Epoch Key for the Identity Protection Key (IPK) to set for the Fabric which is to be added. This is needed to bootstrap a necessary configuration value for sub­ sequent [CASE](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case) to succeed. See [Section 4.14.2.6.1, “Identity Protection Key (IPK)”](#_bookmark384) for details.
>
> The IPK SHALL be provided as an octet string of length CRYPTO_SYMMETRIC_KEY_LENGTH_BYTES.
>
> On successful execution of the AddNOC command, the side-effect of having provided this field SHALL be equivalent to having done a [GroupKeyManagement](#group-key-management-cluster) cluster [KeySetWrite](#keysetwrite-command) command invo­ cation using the newly joined fabric as the [accessing fabric](#accessing-fabric) and with the following argument fields (assuming KeySetWrite allowed a GroupKeySetID set to 0):

> **CaseAdminSubject Field**
>
> If the AddNOC command succeeds according to the semantics of the following subsections, then the Access Control [SubjectID](#_bookmark994) SHALL be used to atomically add an [Access Control Entry](#acl-attribute) enabling that Subject to subsequently administer the Node whose operational identity is being added by this com­ mand.
>
> The format of the new Access Control Entry, created from this, SHALL be:

[TABLE]

#### NOTE

> Unless such an Access Control Entry is added atomically as described here, there would be no way for the caller on its given Fabric to eventually add another [Access](#acl-attribute) [Control Entry](#acl-attribute) for CASE authentication mode, to enable the new Administrator to administer the device, since the [Fabric Scoping](#fabric-scoped-data) of the Access Control List prevents the current Node from being able to write new entries scoped to that Fabric, if the session is established from [CASE](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case). While a session established from [PASE](#passcode-authenticated-session-establishment-pase) does gain Fabric Scope of a newly-joined Fabric, this argument is made mandatory to provide symmetry between both types of session establishment, both of which need to even­ tually add an "Administer Node over CASE" Access Control Entry to finalize new Fabric configuration and subsequently be able to call the [CommissioningComplete](#commissioningcomplete-command) command.
>
> **AdminVendorID Field**
>
> This field SHALL be set to the [Vendor ID](#vendor-identifier-vendor-id-vid) of the entity issuing the AddNOC command. This value SHALL NOT be one of the reserved Vendor ID values defined in [Table 1, “Vendor ID Allocations”](#_bookmark110).
>
> **Effect When Received**
>
> If this command is received without an armed fail-safe context (see [ArmFailSafe](#armfailsafe-command)), then this com­ mand SHALL fail with a FAILSAFE_REQUIRED status code sent back to the initiator.
>
> If a prior UpdateNOC or AddNOC command was successfully executed within the fail-safe timer period, then this command SHALL fail with a CONSTRAINT_ERROR status code sent back to the ini­ tiator.
>
> If the prior [CSRRequest](#csrrequest-command) state that preceded AddNOC had the IsForUpdateNOC field indicated as true, then this command SHALL fail with a CONSTRAINT_ERROR status code sent back to the initia­ tor.
>
> If no prior [AddTrustedRootCertificate](#addtrustedrootcertificate-command) command was successfully executed within the fail-safe timer period, then this command SHALL process an error by responding with a [NOCResponse](#nocresponse-command) with a StatusCode of [InvalidNOC](#_bookmark1571) as described in [Section 11.18.6.7.2, “Handling Errors”](#_bookmark1598). In other words, AddNOC always requires that the client provides the root of trust certificate within the same Fail- Safe context as the rest of the new fabric’s operational credentials, even if some other fabric already uses the exact same root of trust certificate.
>
> If the NOC provided in the NOCValue encodes an [Operational Identifier](#node-operational-identifier-composition) for a \<Root Public Key, Fab­ ricID\> pair already present on the device, then the device SHALL process the error by responding with a StatusCode of [FabricConflict](#_bookmark1575) as described in [Section 11.18.6.7.2, “Handling Errors”](#_bookmark1598).
>
> If the device already has the CommissionedFabrics attribute equal to the SupportedFabrics attribute, then the device’s operational credentials table is considered full and the device SHALL process the error by responding with a StatusCode of [TableFull](#_bookmark1573) as described in [Section 11.18.6.7.2,](#_bookmark1598) [“Handling Errors”](#_bookmark1598).
>
> If the [CaseAdminSubject](#_bookmark1601) field is not a valid [ACL subject](#_bookmark993) in the context of [AuthMode](#_bookmark992) set to CASE, such as not being in either the [Operational or CASE Authenticated Tag](#_bookmark119) range, then the device SHALL process the error by responding with a StatusCode of [InvalidAdminSubject](#_bookmark1574) as described in [Section 11.18.6.7.2, “Handling Errors”](#_bookmark1598).
>
> Otherwise, the command is considered an addition of credentials, also known as "joining a fabric", and the following SHALL apply:

1.  A new FabricIndex SHALL be allocated, taking the next valid [fabric-index](#fabric-index-type) value in monotoni­ cally incrementing order, wrapping around from 254 (0xFE) to 1, since value 0 is reserved and using 255 (0xFF) would prevent cluster specifications from using nullable fabric-idx fields.

2.  An entry within the [Fabrics attribute](#fabrics-attribute) table SHALL be added, reflecting the matter-fabric-id RDN within the NOC’s subject, along with the public key of the [trusted root](#trusted-root-ca-certificates) of the chain and the [AdminVendorID](#_bookmark1602) field.

3.  The operational key pair associated with the incoming NOC from the NOCValue, and generated by the prior CSRRequest command, SHALL be recorded for subsequent use during [CASE](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case) within the fail-safe timer period (see [Section 5.5, “Commissioning Flows”](#commissioning-flows)).

4.  The incoming NOCValue and ICACValue (if present) SHALL be stored under the FabricIndex associated with the new [Fabric Scope](#fabric-scoped-data), along with the RootCACertificate provided with the prior successful AddTrustedRootCertificate command invoked in the same fail-safe period.

    1.  Implementation of certificate chain storage MAY separate or otherwise encode the compo­ nents of the array in implementation-specific ways, as long as they follow the correct format when being read from the [NOCs](#nocs-attribute) list or used within other protocols such as [CASE](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case).

5.  The [NOCs](#nocs-attribute) list SHALL reflect the incoming NOC from the NOCValue field and ICAC from the ICAC­ Value field (if present).

6.  The [operational discovery](#operational-discovery) service record SHALL immediately reflect the new Operational Iden­ tifier, such that the Node immediately begins to exist within the Fabric and becomes reachable over [CASE](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case) under the new operational identity.

7.  The receiver SHALL create and add a new Access Control Entry using the [CaseAdminSubject](#_bookmark1601) field to grant subsequent Administer access to an Administrator member of the new Fabric. It is RECOMMENDED that the Administrator presented in CaseAdminSubject exist within the same entity that is currently invoking the AddNOC command, within another of the Fabrics of which it is a member.

    1.  If the Managed Device Feature is implemented by the ACL cluster, then one or more ARL entries with the new FabricIndex MAY be added to the [ARL attribute](#arl-attribute).

8.  The incoming IPKValue SHALL be stored in the Fabric-scoped slot within the Group Key Man­

> agement cluster (see [KeySetWrite](#keysetwrite-command)), for subsequent use during [CASE](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case).

9.  The Fabric Index associated with the armed fail-safe context (see [ArmFailSafe](#armfailsafe-command)) SHALL be updated to match the Fabric Index just allocated.

10. If the current secure session was established with [PASE](#passcode-authenticated-session-establishment-pase), the receiver SHALL:

    1.  Augment the [secure session context](#secure-session-context) with the FabricIndex generated above, such that subse­ quent interactions have the proper [accessing fabric](#accessing-fabric).

11. If the current secure session was established with [CASE](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case), subsequent configuration of the newly installed Fabric requires the opening of a new CASE session from the Administrator from the Fabric just installed. This Administrator is the one listed in the [CaseAdminSubject](#_bookmark1601) argument.

> Thereafter, the Node SHALL respond with an NOCResponse with a [StatusCode](#nodeoperationalcertstatusenum-type) of OK and a FabricIn­ dex field matching the FabricIndex under which the new [Node Operational Certificate (NOC)](#node-operational-certificate-noc) is scoped.

#### UpdateNOC Command

> This command SHALL replace the NOC and optional associated ICAC (if present) scoped under the accessing fabric upon successful validation of all arguments and preconditions. The new value SHALL immediately be reflected in the [NOCs](#nocs-attribute) list attribute.
>
> A Commissioner or Administrator SHALL issue this command after issuing the [CSRRequest Com­](#csrrequest-command) [mand](#csrrequest-command) and receiving its response.
>
> A Commissioner or Administrator SHOULD issue this command after performing the [Attestation](#device-attestation-procedure) [Procedure](#device-attestation-procedure).

1.  The Operational Certificate under the [accessing fabric index](#_bookmark691) in the [NOCs](#nocs-attribute) list SHALL be updated to match the incoming NOCValue and ICACValue (if present), such that the Node’s Operational Identifier within the Fabric immediately changes.

    1.  The operational key pair associated with the incoming NOC from the NOCValue, and gener­ ated by the prior CSRRequest command, SHALL be committed to permanent storage, for subsequent use during [CASE](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case).

    2.  The [operational discovery](#operational-discovery) service record SHALL immediately reflect the new Operational Identifier.

    3.  All internal data reflecting the prior operational identifier of the Node within the Fabric SHALL be revoked and removed, to an outcome equivalent to the disappearance of the prior Node, except for the ongoing [CASE](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case) session context, which SHALL temporarily remain valid until the NOCResponse has been successfully delivered or until the next transport-layer error, so that the response can be received by the Administrator invoking the command.

> Thereafter, the Node SHALL respond with an NOCResponse with a [StatusCode](#nodeoperationalcertstatusenum-type) of OK and a FabricIn­ dex field matching the FabricIndex under which the updated [NOC](#node-operational-certificate-noc) is scoped.

#### NOCResponse Command

> This command SHALL be generated in response to the following commands:

- AddNOC

- UpdateNOC

- UpdateFabricLabel

>
> Otherwise, the Label field for the accessing fabric SHALL immediately be updated to reflect the Label argument provided. Following the update, an NOCResponse with a StatusCode of OK SHALL be returned.
>
> If the command was invoked within a fail-safe context after a successful [UpdateNOC](#updatenoc-command) command, then the label update SHALL apply to the pending update state that will be reverted if fail-safe expires prior to a [CommissioningComplete](#commissioningcomplete-command) command. In other words, label updates apply to the state of the [Fabrics Attribute](#fabrics-attribute) as currently visible, even for an existing fabric currently in process of being updated.

#### RemoveFabric Command

> This command is used by Administrators to remove a given Fabric and **delete all associated fab­ ric-scoped data**.
>
> If the given Fabric being removed is the last one to reference a given [Trusted Root CA Certificate](#trusted-root-ca-certificates) stored in the [Trusted Root Certificates](#trustedrootcertificates-attribute) list, then that Trusted Root Certificate SHALL be removed.

#### WARNING

> This command, if referring to an already existing Fabric not under the control of the invoking Administrator, SHALL ONLY be invoked after obtaining some form of explicit user consent through some method executed by the Adminis­ trator or Commissioner. This method of obtaining consent SHOULD employ as much data as possible about the existing Fabric associations within the [Fabrics](#fabrics-attribute) list, so that likelihood is as small as possible of a user removing a Fabric unwit­ tingly. If a method exists for an Administrator or Commissioner to convey Fab­ ric Removal to an entity related to that Fabric, whether in-band or out-of-band, then this method SHOULD be used to notify the other Administrative Domain’s party of the removal. Otherwise, users may only observe the removal of a Fab­ ric association as persistently failing attempts to reach a Node operationally.

1.  If the FabricIndex matches the last remaining entry in the [Fabrics](#fabrics-attribute) list, then the device SHALL delete all Matter related data on the node which was created since it was commissioned. This includes all Fabric-Scoped data, including Access Control List, Access Restriction List, bindings, scenes, group keys, operational certificates, etc. All Trusted Roots SHALL also be removed. If a time synchronization cluster is present on the Node, the TrustedTimeSource and DefaultNtp SHALL be set to null. Any Matter related data including logs, secure sessions, exchanges and interaction model constructs SHALL also be removed. Since this operation involves the removal of the secure session data that may underpin the current set of exchanges, the Node invoking the command SHOULD NOT expect a response before terminating its secure session with the target.

2.  If the FabricIndex does not equal the [accessing fabric index](#_bookmark691), then the device SHALL begin the process of irrevocably deleting all associated Fabric-Scoped data, including Access Control Entries, Access Restriction Entries, bindings, group keys, operational certificates, etc. Any remaining Trusted Roots no longer referenced by any operational certificate SHALL also be removed. If a time synchronization cluster is present on the Node, and the TrustedTimeSource FabricIndex matches the given FabricIndex, the TrustedTimeSource SHALL be set to null. All secure sessions, exchanges and interaction model constructs related to the Operational Identity under the given Fabric SHALL also be removed. Following the removal, an NOCResponse with a StatusCode of OK SHALL be returned.

3.  If the FabricIndex equals the [accessing fabric index](#_bookmark691), then the device SHALL begin the process of irrevocably deleting all associated Fabric-Scoped data, including Access Control Entries, Access Restriction Entries, bindings, group keys, operational certificates, etc. Any remaining Trusted Roots no longer referenced by any operational certificate SHALL also be removed. If a time syn­ chronization cluster is present on the Node, and the TrustedTimeSource FabricIndex matches the given FabricIndex, the TrustedTimeSource SHALL be set to null. All secure sessions, exchanges and interaction model constructs related to the Operational Identity under the given Fabric SHALL also be removed. Since this operation involves the removal of the secure session data that may underpin the current set of exchanges, the Node invoking the command SHOULD NOT expect a response before terminating its secure session with the target.

#### AddTrustedRootCertificate Command

> This command SHALL add a [Trusted Root CA Certificate](#trusted-root-ca-certificates), provided as its [Matter Certificate Encoding](#matter-certificate) representation, to the [TrustedRootCertificates Attribute](#trustedrootcertificates-attribute) list and SHALL ensure the next [AddNOC](#addnoc-command) command executed uses the provided certificate as its root of trust.

>
> If a prior UpdateNOC or AddNOC command was successfully executed within the fail-safe timer period, then this command SHALL fail with a CONSTRAINT_ERROR status code sent back to the ini­ tiator.
>
> If the certificate from the RootCACertificate field fails any validity checks, not fulfilling all the requirements for a valid [Matter Certificate Encoding](#matter-certificate) representation, including a truncated or over­ size value, then this command SHALL fail with an INVALID_COMMAND status code sent back to the initiator.

## Administrator Commissioning Cluster

> This cluster is used to trigger a Node to allow a new Administrator to commission it. It defines Attributes, Commands and Responses needed for this purpose.
>
> There are two methods of commissioning, Basic Commissioning which MAY be supported and is described in [Section 5.6.2, “Basic Commissioning Method (BCM)”](#basic-commissioning-method-bcm) and Enhanced Commissioning which SHALL be supported and is described in [Section 5.6.3, “Enhanced Commissioning Method](#enhanced-commissioning-method-ecm) [(ECM)”](#enhanced-commissioning-method-ecm).
>
> For the management of Operational Credentials and Trusted Root Certificates, the [Node Operational](#node-operational-credentials-cluster) [Credentials cluster](#node-operational-credentials-cluster) is used.
>
> If the Administrator Commissioning Cluster server instance is present on an endpoint with the Root Node device type in the Descriptor cluster DeviceTypeList, then:

- The Commissioning Window SHALL be opened or closed on the node that the Root Node end­ point is on.

- The attributes SHALL indicate the state of the node that the Root Node endpoint is on.

> If the Administrator Commissioning Cluster server instance is present on an endpoint with the Bridged Node device type in the Descriptor cluster DeviceTypeList, then:

- The Commissioning Window SHALL be opened or closed on the node represented by the Bridged Node.

- The attributes SHALL indicate the state of the node that is represented by the Bridged Node.

#### WindowStatus Attribute

> This attribute SHALL indicate whether a new Commissioning window has been opened by an Administrator, using either the [OpenCommissioningWindow](#opencommissioningwindow-command) command or the [OpenBasicCommis­](#openbasiccommissioningwindow-command) [sioningWindow](#openbasiccommissioningwindow-command) command.
>
> This attribute SHALL revert to WindowNotOpen upon expiry of a commissioning window.

#### NOTE

> An initial commissioning window is not opened using either the [OpenCommission­](#opencommissioningwindow-command) [ingWindow](#opencommissioningwindow-command) command or the [OpenBasicCommissioningWindow](#openbasiccommissioningwindow-command) command, and therefore this attribute SHALL be set to WindowNotOpen on initial commissioning.

#### AdminFabricIndex Attribute

> When the [WindowStatus](#windowstatus-attribute) attribute is not set to WindowNotOpen, this attribute SHALL indicate the FabricIndex associated with the Fabric scoping of the Administrator that opened the window. This MAY be used to cross-reference in the [Fabrics](#fabrics-attribute) attribute of the [Node Operational Credentials](#node-operational-credentials-cluster) cluster.
>
> If, during an open commissioning window, the fabric for the Administrator that opened the win­ dow is removed, then this attribute SHALL be set to null.
>
> When the [WindowStatus](#windowstatus-attribute) attribute is set to WindowNotOpen, this attribute SHALL be set to null.

#### AdminVendorId Attribute

> When the [WindowStatus](#windowstatus-attribute) attribute is not set to WindowNotOpen, this attribute SHALL indicate the [Vendor ID](#vendor-identifier-vendor-id-vid) associated with the Fabric scoping of the Administrator that opened the window. This field SHALL match the [VendorID](#_bookmark1580) field of the [Fabrics](#fabrics-attribute) attribute list entry associated with the Admin­ istrator having opened the window, at the time of window opening. If the fabric for the Administra­ tor that opened the window is removed from the node while the commissioning window is still open, this attribute SHALL NOT be updated.
>
> When the [WindowStatus](#windowstatus-attribute) attribute is set to WindowNotOpen, this attribute SHALL be set to null.

> Only one commissioning window can be active at a time. If a Node receives another open commis­ sioning command when an Open Commissioning Window is already active, it SHALL return a fail­ ure response (see [Section 11.19.6, “Status Codes”](#status-codes-4)).

#### OpenCommissioningWindow Command

> This command is used by a current Administrator to instruct a Node to go into commissioning mode. The [Enhanced Commissioning Method](#enhanced-commissioning-method-ecm) specifies a window of time during which an already commissioned Node accepts [PASE](#passcode-authenticated-session-establishment-pase) sessions. The current Administrator MUST specify a timeout value for the duration of the OpenCommissioningWindow command.
>
> When the OpenCommissioningWindow command expires or commissioning completes, the Node SHALL remove the Passcode by deleting the [PAKE](#password-authenticated-key-exchange-pake) passcode verifier as well as stop publishing the DNS-SD record corresponding to this command as described in [Section 4.3.1, “Commissionable](#commissionable-node-discovery)
>
> [Node Discovery”](#commissionable-node-discovery). The commissioning into a new Fabric completes when the Node successfully receives a [CommissioningComplete](#commissioningcomplete-command) command, see [Section 5.5, “Commissioning Flows”](#commissioning-flows).
>
> The parameters for OpenCommissioningWindow command are as follows:

[TABLE]

> A current Administrator MAY invoke this command to put a node in commissioning mode for the next Administrator. On completion, the command SHALL return a cluster specific status code from the [Section 11.19.6, “Status Codes”](#status-codes-4) below reflecting success or reasons for failure of the operation. The new Administrator SHALL discover the Node on the IP network using DNS-based Service Dis­ covery (DNS-SD) for commissioning.
>
> If any format or validity errors related to the PAKEPasscodeVerifier, Iterations or Salt arguments arise, this command SHALL fail with a cluster specific status code of PAKEParameterError.
>
> If a commissioning window is already currently open, this command SHALL fail with a cluster spe­ cific status code of Busy.
>
> If the [fail-safe timer](#armfailsafe-command) is currently armed, this command SHALL fail with a cluster specific status code of Busy, since it is likely that concurrent commissioning operations from multiple separate Commis­ sioners are about to take place.
>
> In case of any other parameter error, this command SHALL fail with a status code of COM­ MAND_INVALID.
>
> **CommissioningTimeout Field**
>
> This field SHALL specify the time in seconds during which commissioning session establishment is allowed by the Node. This timeout value SHALL follow guidance as specified in the initial [Announcement Duration](#announcement-duration). The CommissioningTimeout applies only to cessation of any announce­ ments and to accepting of new commissioning sessions; it does not apply to abortion of connec­ tions, i.e., a commissioning session SHOULD NOT abort prematurely upon expiration of this time­ out.
>
> **PAKEPasscodeVerifier Field**
>
> This field SHALL specify an ephemeral PAKE passcode verifier (see [Section 3.10, “Password-Authen­](#password-authenticated-key-exchange-pake) [ticated Key Exchange (PAKE)”](#password-authenticated-key-exchange-pake)) computed by the existing Administrator to be used for this commis­ sioning. The field is concatenation of two values (w0 \|\| L) SHALL be (CRYPTO_GROUP_SIZE_BYTES + CRYPTO_PUBLIC_KEY_SIZE_BYTES)-octets long as detailed in [Crypto_PAKEValues_Responder](#_bookmark176). It SHALL be derived from an ephemeral passcode (See [PAKE](#_bookmark176)). It SHALL be deleted by the Node at the end of commissioning or expiration of the OpenCommissioningWindow command, and SHALL be deleted by the existing Administrator after sending it to the Node(s).
>
> **Discriminator Field**
>
> This field SHALL be used by the Node as the long discriminator for DNS-SD advertisement (see [Commissioning Discriminator](#txt-key-for-discriminator-d)) for discovery by the new Administrator. The new Administrator can find and filter DNS-SD records by long discriminator to locate and initiate commissioning with the appropriate Node.
>
> **Iterations Field**
>
> This field SHALL be used by the Node as the PAKE iteration count associated with the ephemeral PAKE passcode verifier to be used for this commissioning, which SHALL be sent by the Node to the new Administrator’s software as response to the [PBKDFParamRequest](#_bookmark351) during [PASE](#passcode-authenticated-session-establishment-pase) negotiation. The permitted range of values SHALL match the range specified in [Section 3.9, “Password-Based](#password-based-key-derivation-function-pbkdf) [Key Derivation Function (PBKDF)”](#password-based-key-derivation-function-pbkdf), within the definition of the Crypto_PBKDFParameterSet.
>
> **Salt Field**
>
> This field SHALL be used by the Node as the PAKE Salt associated with the ephemeral PAKE pass­ code verifier to be used for this commissioning, which SHALL be sent by the Node to the new Administrator’s software as response to the [PBKDFParamRequest](#_bookmark351) during [PASE](#passcode-authenticated-session-establishment-pase) negotiation. The constraints on the value SHALL match those specified in [Section 3.9, “Password-Based Key Deriva­](#password-based-key-derivation-function-pbkdf) [tion Function (PBKDF)”](#password-based-key-derivation-function-pbkdf), within the definition of the Crypto_PBKDFParameterSet.
>
> When a Node receives the [Open Commissioning Window](#opencommissioningwindow-command) command, it SHALL begin advertising on DNS-SD as described in [Section 4.3.1, “Commissionable Node Discovery”](#commissionable-node-discovery) and for a time period as described in [CommissioningTimeout](#_bookmark1621). When the command is received by a [ICD](#intermittently-connected-device-icd), it SHALL enter into [active mode](#_bookmark1090). The [ICD](#intermittently-connected-device-icd) SHALL remain in Active Mode as long as one of these conditions is met:

- A commissioning window is open.

- There is an armed [fail-safe timer](#armfailsafe-command).

#### OpenBasicCommissioningWindow Command

> This command MAY be used by a current Administrator to instruct a Node to go into commissioning mode, if the node supports the [Basic Commissioning Method](#basic-commissioning-method-bcm). The [Basic Commissioning Method](#basic-commissioning-method-bcm) specifies a window of time during which an already commissioned Node accepts [PASE](#passcode-authenticated-session-establishment-pase) sessions. The current Administrator SHALL specify a timeout value for the duration of the OpenBasicCommis­ sioningWindow command.
>
> If a commissioning window is already currently open, this command SHALL fail with a cluster spe­
>
> cific status code of Busy.
>
> If the [fail-safe timer](#armfailsafe-command) is currently armed, this command SHALL fail with a cluster specific status code of Busy, since it is likely that concurrent commissioning operations from multiple separate Commis­ sioners are about to take place.
>
> In case of any other parameter error, this command SHALL fail with a status code of COM­ MAND_INVALID.
>
> The commissioning into a new Fabric completes when the Node successfully receives a [Commis­](#commissioningcomplete-command) [sioningComplete](#commissioningcomplete-command) command, see [Section 5.5, “Commissioning Flows”](#commissioning-flows). The new Administrator SHALL discover the Node on the IP network using DNS-based Service Discovery (DNS-SD) for commission­ ing.
>
> The data for this command is as follows:

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **Commis­ sioning­ Timeout** | uint16 | desc |  |  | M |

> **CommissioningTimeout Field**
>
> This field SHALL specify the time in seconds during which commissioning session establishment is allowed by the Node. This timeout SHALL follow guidance as specified in the initial [Announcement](#announcement-duration) [Duration](#announcement-duration).
>
> When a Node receives the [OpenBasicCommissioningWindow](#openbasiccommissioningwindow-command) command, it SHALL begin advertising on DNS-SD as described in [Section 4.3.1, “Commissionable Node Discovery”](#commissionable-node-discovery) and for a time period as described in [CommissioningTimeout](#_bookmark1623). When the command is received by a [ICD](#intermittently-connected-device-icd), it SHALL enter into [active mode](#_bookmark1090). The [ICD](#intermittently-connected-device-icd) SHALL remain in Active Mode as long as one of these conditions is met:

- A commissioning window is open.

- There is an armed [fail-safe timer](#armfailsafe-command).

#### RevokeCommissioning Command

> This command is used by a current Administrator to instruct a Node to revoke any active [OpenCom­](#opencommissioningwindow-command) [missioningWindow](#opencommissioningwindow-command) or [OpenBasicCommissioningWindow](#openbasiccommissioningwindow-command) command. This is an idempotent com­ mand and the Node SHALL (for ECM) delete the temporary PAKEPasscodeVerifier and associated data, and stop publishing the DNS-SD record associated with the [OpenCommissioningWindow](#opencommissioningwindow-command) or [OpenBasicCommissioningWindow](#openbasiccommissioningwindow-command) command, see [Section 4.3.1, “Commissionable Node Discovery”](#commissionable-node-discovery).
>
> If no commissioning window was open at time of receipt, this command SHALL fail with a cluster specific status code of WindowNotOpen.
>
> If the commissioning window was open and the fail-safe was armed when this command is received, the device SHALL immediately expire the fail-safe and perform the cleanup steps outlined
>
> in [Section 11.10.7.2.2, “Behavior on expiry of Fail-Safe timer”](#_bookmark1408).

## Over-the-Air (OTA) Software Update

### Scope & Purpose

> The majority of IoT devices require security and/or functional feature updates during their lifetime.
>
> This section describes a set of OTA software update capabilities which enable an "OTA Requestor" to be informed of, obtain, and install software updates from a Node fulfilling the role of an "OTA Provider".
>
> An "OTA Requestor" is any Node implementing the OTA Requestor Device Type (0x0012), which ful­ fills the client role for the [OTA Software Update Provider cluster](#ota-software-update-provider-cluster) and the server role for the [OTA](#ota-software-update-requestor-cluster) [Software Update Requestor cluster](#ota-software-update-requestor-cluster). An "OTA Provider" is any Node implementing the OTA Provider Device Type (0x0014), which fulfills the server role for the [OTA Software Update Provider cluster](#ota-software-update-provider-cluster) and the client role for the [OTA Software Update Requestor cluster](#ota-software-update-requestor-cluster).
>
> The OTA updates capabilities are designed to support:

- A mechanism to inform OTA Requestors about available OTA Providers.

- A mechanism to allow OTA Requestors to acquire information about available OTA Software Images.

- A mechanism to allow constrained OTA Requestors to obtain OTA Software Images through a local proxy, e.g. if they are not able or willing to proceed with a direct download from the Inter­ net.

- A mechanism to allow OTA Requestors supporting legacy, non-native, or out-of-band update methods to notify an OTA Provider of having completed an update out-of-band.

- A mechanism to allow deferred installation of a software update, based on administrative rules.

- A mechanism to allow user consent to be considered before offering Software Images to OTA Requestors.

> OTA Requestors wishing to update their software using these capabilities MAY need to use an appli­ cation bootloader and MAY require sufficient additional storage in order to download an OTA image.
>
> Furthermore, to encourage interoperability and timely software updates, the OTA update mecha­ nisms provide means of obtaining Software Images which can be uniformly implemented across OTA Requestors on devices from a variety of different vendors. The OTA Providers SHOULD provide services to OTA Requestors from vendors other than its own, as long as the location of Software Update images for these vendors is found. The [Distributed Compliance Ledger](#distributed-compliance-ledger) is one such central­ ized source of software update image locations that MAY allow OTA Providers to provide OTA Soft­ ware Update Images generically to devices from many vendors.

### Functional overview

> An OTA Requestor SHALL query the OTA Provider periodically to determine the availability of new
>
> Software Images. The OTA Provider MAY learn, from backend systems inside or outside of Fabric scope, of the availability of a new Software Image for an OTA Requestor.
>
> An OTA Requestor which has been updated using a mechanism beyond this Cluster MAY report to an OTA Provider that a Software Image update has been completed.
>
> The OTA Provider MAY announce its presence to OTA Requestors on the Fabric to assist in discovery of this service (see [AnnounceOTAProvider](#_bookmark1675)).
>
> Nodes SHALL NOT rely solely on unsolicited OTA Provider announcements to discover available OTA Providers and SHALL instead employ other means such as using OTA Provider records provi­ sioned during Commissioning, or dynamic discovery of OTA Providers.
>
> OTA Requestors SHALL only upgrade to numerically newer versions and OTA Providers SHALL only ever provide a numerically newer Software Image than a Node’s current version number (see [SoftwareVersion](#softwareversion-attribute)). Any functional rollback SHALL be affected by the Vendor creating a Software Image with a newer (higher) version number, but whose binary contents may match prior func­ tionality.
>
> All OTA Requestors SHALL support usage of a polling mechanism to send a query command to the OTA Provider in order to determine if the OTA Provider has any new Software Images for it. Polling simplifies processing for OTA Requestors that MAY need to perform special setup to get ready to receive a Software Images, such as unlocking flash or allocating space for a new Software Images.
>
> It is ideal to have OTA Providers maintain as little state as possible since this will scale better when there are hundreds of OTA Requestors in a given Fabric. The OTA Provider is not required to keep track of what pieces of an image that a particular OTA Requestor has received.
>
> The flow for querying the availability of a new version is done using commands of the OTA Provider Cluster. In case of a new image available matching an OTA Requestor’s request, the response to the [QueryImage command](#_bookmark1649) SHALL contain a URI where the given image can be down­ loaded.
>
> The download protocol is separate from the Cluster commands. All OTA Providers SHALL support the [BDX Protocol](#bulk-data-exchange-protocol-bdx) to allow for the downloading of OTA images by both sleepy End Devices and more capable devices, without requiring access to the public Internet from the OTA Requestor. OTA Requestors SHOULD support the [BDX Protocol](#bulk-data-exchange-protocol-bdx).
>
> In order to maximize the interoperable combinations of deployed products and Fabric Administra­ tors, the CSA’s Distributed Compliance Ledger (DCL) MAY contain sufficient OTA Software Update information to cover a large number of products, using a federated mechanism of data mainte­ nance. See [Section 11.23, “Distributed Compliance Ledger”](#distributed-compliance-ledger) for details on the Distributed Compli­ ance Ledger common data schemas. See [Section 11.20.3.3.2, “Conceptual algorithm for matching](#_bookmark1634) [OTA Software Images applicable to a query”](#_bookmark1634) for the conceptual algorithm recommended for imple­ mentation by OTA Providers to match records available in the DCL to incoming queries.

### Software update workflow

> The software update workflow consists of several steps executed in a sequence from an OTA Requestor towards an OTA Provider. When a newer Software Image for an OTA Requestor is avail­
>
> able on the OTA Provider this results in an updated Software Image being acquired and applied by said OTA Requestor.
>
> The steps, in order, and assuming each step successfully leads to the next, are the following, with each numbered according to [Figure 91, “Detailed OTA Software Update Workflow”](#_bookmark1628):

- \[10\] OTA Provider optionally announces its presence to nodes (see [AnnounceOTAProvider](#_bookmark1675)). This MAY be used in addition to other OTA Provider discovery methods.

- \[11\] OTA Requestor determines OTA Provider to query.

- \[11\] OTA Requestor queries the OTA Provider for availability of an updated Software Image ver­ sion.

- \[30..34\] OTA Provider obtains consent from user to apply the OTA update.

- \[40..41\] OTA Provider obtains a copy of the new Software Image, either in real time or in a time- deferred manner, to provide to the OTA Requestor over [BDX Protocol](#bulk-data-exchange-protocol-bdx), or over an alternate sup­ ported protocol that both OTA Provider and OTA Requestor support. If the Software Image hap­ pens to be already available in the OTA Provider’s [cache](#_bookmark1638), this step can be skipped.

- \[52\] OTA Requestor downloads the update, either over [BDX Protocol](#bulk-data-exchange-protocol-bdx) from OTA Provider acting as a proxy, or over an alternate protocol that both OTA Provider and OTA Requestor support.

- \[60\] OTA Requestor notifies the OTA Provider that the download is complete and that it is ready to apply the downloaded image.

- \[61\] OTA Provider responds with an authorization to apply the update, after an optional delay.

- \[62\] OTA Requestor applies the update and starts executing updated software.

- \[63\] OTA Requestor notifies the OTA Provider of having successfully applied the update.

> In order to illustrate more specifically these steps, [Figure 91, “Detailed OTA Software Update Work­](#_bookmark1628) [flow”](#_bookmark1628) below depicts a detailed sequence showing the following illustrative (not normative) aspects:

- \[10..21\] Determining the availability of an OTA software update.

- \[22\] Deferral of download by OTA Provider responding with a "Busy" condition, while it obtains user consent and obtains the Software Image from a vendor server based on information in the OTA Provider’s OTA Software Update logic.

- Obtaining user consent in one of these ways:

  - \[30..31\] Out-of-band notification through some externally-provided user interface, such as a mobile device terminal operated by an authorized user, and connected to OTA Provider’s logic in some way.

  - \[32..34\] Reuse of prior user consent, perhaps from a continued but revokable authorization, sent back to the OTA Provider by OTA Software Update logic.

  - Via the OTA Provider delegating to the OTA Requestor Node (see [Section 11.20.3.4.1, “User](#_bookmark1636) [consent delegation to Nodes”](#_bookmark1636)). Note that this case is not illustrated in the sequence diagram.

- \[40..41\] Downloading and temporarily storing a Software Image by the OTA Provider, from a Vendor’s server, over the public Internet, for the purposes of eventual proxied local download by the OTA Requestor.

&nbsp;

- \[50..51\] Responding positively to a subsequent query by the OTA Requestor, since an OTA soft­ ware update is now definitely available.

- \[52\] Downloading of the Software Image from the OTA Provider by the OTA Requestor, using the [BDX Protocol](#bulk-data-exchange-protocol-bdx) against the temporary storage of the OTA Provider.

- \[60..63\] OTA Requestor performs the update (after permission from OTA Provider)

>
> Given that some of the above steps MAY fail to complete, and that some MAY provide a variety of outcomes or replies, the following subsections give the necessary normative details describing the sequence.

#### Determining the OTA Provider to query

> The discovery of available OTA Providers is necessary for OTA Requestors to be able to query for new software images. Each OTA Requestor SHALL keep a list of OTA Provider Operational Identi­ fiers (see [Node Identifier](#node-identifier)) that it could query.
>
> A given OTA Requestor SHALL have sufficient storage to maintain one OTA Provider entry per Fab­ ric within the [DefaultOTAProviders](#_bookmark1673) default list. This default OTA Provider list MAY be augmented by any means deemed acceptable by a given OTA Requestor, such that the internal list of possible locations to query contains at least the DefaultOTAProviders, but it MAY contain more. For example, it may contain cached locations that arose from the [AnnounceOTAProvider](#_bookmark1675) command.
>
> When an OTA Requestor determines that it is time to query an OTA Provider, it MAY use any method of its choosing to determine which OTA Provider to contact for its next query.
>
> An OTA Requestor MAY expunge OTA Providers from its OTA Provider list if it determines that the entry is stale or obsolete.
>
> Discovery of additional OTA Providers MAY be done by handling the arrival of [AnnounceO­](#_bookmark1675) [TAProvider](#_bookmark1675) commands invoked by OTA Providers.
>
> Commissioners SHOULD add an entry to the [DefaultOTAProviders](#_bookmark1673) list attribute, if an OTA Provider is known at commissioning time, to reduce the delay between commissioning and first [QueryImage](#_bookmark1649) [command](#_bookmark1649).
>
> Whenever communicating with an OTA Provider location obtained either through the DefaultO­ TAProviders attribute, or the AnnounceOTAProvider command, an OTA Requestor SHALL target all interactions with that Node by interacting with the given Endpoint on the given ProviderNodeID obtained from these sources.
>
> Discovery of additional OTA Providers MAY be done using runtime service discovery, which is out­ side the scope of this specification.
>
> Nodes MAY attempt to contact OTA Providers that are known to them in any order if failing to reach a default OTA Provider from an entry in the [DefaultOTAProviders](#_bookmark1673) list. This approach would assist in maximizing likelihood of eventual success.

#### Querying the OTA Provider

> Query of the OTA Provider SHALL be done using the [QueryImage command](#_bookmark1649). The arguments for this command provide sufficient information to allow the OTA Provider to determine the availability of a new image for the querying OTA Requestor.
>
> An OTA Requestor SHALL NOT query more frequently than once every 120 seconds, unless a Node loses its timekeeping state, due to events such as power loss or restart, that prevent applying such a delay. This reduces the burden on both the OTA Providers providing the service to a large number of nodes and the supporting networking infrastructure. It is recommended for OTA Requestors to attempt a daily [QueryImage command](#_bookmark1649), if capable, to ensure timely access to updated software, including security-critical updates.
>
> The OTA Provider SHALL use an algorithm deemed satisfactory by its implementer to determine
>
> the availability of a newer Software Image in response to a [QueryImage command](#_bookmark1649). This algorithm will be called the "OTA Image Selection Logic" thereafter.
>
> The OTA Image Selection Logic MAY use any data it deems useful, either local to the equipment or Node hosting the OTA Provider, or remote through external networks, to determine whether an updated Software Image is available (see [Section 11.20.3.3, “Availability of Software Images”](#availability-of-software-images)).
>
> OTA Provider requests are idempotent. In cases where an OTA Requestor is repeating a request it has already done, and the OTA Provider can detect this, it SHALL NOT behave differently on any subsequent attempt compared to the first, unless a new Software Image has become available in the meantime. That is, an OTA Provider SHALL NOT prevent an OTA Requestor from trying to make the same query more than once. This requirement is critical to ensure that OTA Requestors which encounter error conditions during OTA Image Query or OTA Image Transfer can eventually succeed through retrying the same operation more than once.
>
> Upon final determination of the outcome of the [QueryImage command](#_bookmark1649), the OTA Provider SHALL reply with a [QueryImageResponse command](#_bookmark1656).
>
> If an OTA Provider employs synchronous proxying (e.g. proxy-while-downloading) method to reach off-Fabric Software Images and provide them over [BDX Protocol](#bulk-data-exchange-protocol-bdx) to OTA Requestors, it SHALL respond with a Status of DownloadProtocolNotSupported to an OTA Requestor in the [QueryIm­](#_bookmark1656) [ageResponse command](#_bookmark1656) if all the following conditions apply:

1.  A new Software Image is determined to be available.

2.  The Software Image to proxy is served by a remote server that does NOT support range-based transfers.

3.  The OTA Requestor only supports BDX.

4.  The OTA Provider does not support asynchronous proxying (e.g. download-then-proxy).

> The fields of the [QueryImageResponse command](#_bookmark1656) convey the next steps to take. The primary indica­ tion of action to be taken by the OTA Requestor is expressed in the Status field, with the other fields providing the necessary details as described in the following subsections.
>
> Failure to receive an application-layer response from the OTA Provider after invoking the [QueryIm­](#_bookmark1649) [age command](#_bookmark1649) SHOULD be considered equivalent to having received a [QueryImageResponse com­](#_bookmark1656) [mand](#_bookmark1656) with a Status field containing NotAvailable (see [Section 11.20.3.2.4, “Handling NotAvailable](#_bookmark1631) [value in Status field”](#_bookmark1631)).
>
> **Access Control Requirements**
>
> Commissioners or Administrators SHOULD install necessary [ACL entries](#acl-attribute) at Commissioning time or later to enable the handling of the [AnnounceOTAProvider commands](#_bookmark1675) by OTA Requestors.
>
> Below is an exemplary ACL entry for a Node implementing the OTA Requestor cluster server to sup­ port the processing of the AnnounceOTAProvider command:

> Note that there may be a variety of ACL entry configurations that fulfill the necessary goals, includ­ ing wildcard entries for the Administrators on a given Fabric. The examples above are for illustra­ tion purposes only.
>
> **Handling UpdateAvailable value in Status field**
>
> The UpdateAvailable status indicates that the OTA Provider has an update available.
>
> The remaining fields within the [QueryImageResponse command](#_bookmark1656) SHALL contain the information necessary to allow the OTA Requestor to obtain an updated Software Image.
>
> The field [ImageURI](#imageuri-field) SHALL be set to a location from where the image can be downloaded. The URI provided SHALL be for a protocol within the list of supported protocols provided in the request (see [ProtocolsSupported](#protocolssupported-field)). Selection of the URI is based on the information available in the OTA Provider’s Software Images data set.
>
> The field [UpdateToken](#updatetoken-field) SHALL be populated by the OTA Provider with a value of its choosing, to allow tracking of the flow from a given OTA Requestor when it sends further requests. The valid length of the UpdateToken is between 8 and 32 bytes, inclusively. The token SHALL be recorded by the OTA Requestor, until an OTA Software Update Image is either applied or discarded. This value SHALL be provided to any subsequent ApplyUpdateRequest and NotifyUpdateApplied commands.
>
> The field [SoftwareVersion](#softwareversion-field-1) SHALL be set to the version number matching the new Software Image. Handling of SoftwareVersion and ImageURI fields SHALL follow these rules:

- If the SoftwareVersion field matches the version indicated in the header of a previously down­

> loaded OTA Software Image, one of two cases applies:

1.  Image was fully downloaded and verified: the OTA Requestor SHOULD skip the transfer step (see [Section 11.20.3.5, “Transfer of OTA Software Update images”](#transfer-of-ota-software-update-images)), and move directly to the apply step (see [Section 11.20.3.6, “Applying a software update”](#applying-a-software-update)).

2.  Image was partially downloaded: the OTA Requestor SHOULD attempt to continue the trans­ fer from where it left off, if it is capable, otherwise it SHALL start the transfer anew. See [Sec­](#transfer-of-ota-software-update-images) [tion 11.20.3.5, “Transfer of OTA Software Update images”](#transfer-of-ota-software-update-images) for a description of complete and restarted downloads.

- If the SoftwareVersion field indicates a newer (numerically higher) version than the version currently installed on the OTA Requestor, the OTA Requestor SHOULD proceed with OTA Image Transfer (see [Section 11.20.3.5, “Transfer of OTA Software Update images”](#transfer-of-ota-software-update-images)), after awaiting at least the delay stated by the [DelayedActionTime](#delayedactiontime-field) field, if present.

- If the SoftwareVersion field indicates the same or an older (numerically lower) version, or if the ImageURI field somehow contains information which cannot be used by the OTA Requestor, then the OTA Requestor SHALL go back to awaiting its next OTA Software Update query oppor­ tunity, following the rules previously stated in [Section 11.20.3.2, “Querying the OTA Provider”](#querying-the-ota-provider). In that case, the OTA Requestor MAY attempt to select a different OTA Provider according to [Sec­](#determining-the-ota-provider-to-query) [tion 11.20.3.1, “Determining the OTA Provider to query”](#determining-the-ota-provider-to-query), which MAY cause the OTA Requestor to immediately try another query, but to a different OTA Provider, thus not violating daily allowance of a given OTA Requestor towards a given OTA Provider.

> **Handling Busy value in Status field**
>
> The Busy status indicates that the OTA Provider is busy for any reason and that it can only provide a definite answer at a later time. This MAY be because the OTA Provider is currently determining whether an update is available for the OTA Requestor that made the query. An OTA Requestor SHOULD attempt to query the same OTA Provider again later at least once more if a Busy response is obtained, rather than querying a different OTA Provider in its list, so that the OTA Provider that replied Busy could have had resources available to determine availability.
>
> After a Busy status, the OTA Requestor SHALL NOT re-query the OTA Provider which was the sub­ ject of the command sooner than the longest of either:

- 2 minutes (120 seconds) from the last [QueryImage command](#_bookmark1649);

- the delay stated by the [DelayedActionTime](#delayedactiontime-field) field, if present.

> Note that if a Node loses its timekeeping state due to events such as power loss or restart, the above timing constraint MAY be ignored, however, the previously stated overriding constraint of a mini­ mum delay of 120 seconds between queries to any single OTA Provider by a given OTA Requestor has to be respected.
>
> **Handling NotAvailable value in Status field**
>
> The NotAvailable status indicates that there is definitely no update currently available from the queried OTA Provider.
>
> The OTA Requestor MAY choose to attempt a [QueryImage command](#_bookmark1649) on a different OTA Provider in its OTA Provider List to determine if an update is available from that other OTA Provider.
>
> Otherwise, if there are no other OTA Providers available to query, the OTA Requestor SHALL NOT re-query the OTA Provider which was the subject of the command sooner than 2 minutes (120 sec­ onds) from the last [QueryImage command](#_bookmark1649). Note that if a Node loses its timekeeping state due to events such as power loss or restart, the above timing constraint MAY be ignored, however, the pre­ viously stated overriding constraint of a minimum delay of 120 seconds between queries to any sin­ gle OTA Provider by a given OTA Requestor have to be respected.
>
> **Handling errors from QueryImage Command**
>
> If an OTA Requestor hits error conditions of any kind in invoking the QueryImage command, including receiving DownloadProtocolNotSupported in Status, there are two possible outcomes:

1.  If the OTA Requestor has a Software Image it had previously successfully downloaded and veri­ fied, the OTA Requestor SHOULD skip the Query step, and move directly to the Apply step (see [Section 11.20.3.6, “Applying a software update”](#applying-a-software-update)). This increases the likelihood that the OTA Requestor will eventually succeed to apply a previously transferred Software Image.

2.  If the OTA Requestor is still attempting to discover an OTA Update, it MAY choose to attempt a [QueryImage command](#_bookmark1649) on a different OTA Provider in its OTA Provider List, in which case the timing for the query SHALL match the query timing constraints expressed in the previous para­ graphs of this section. Otherwise, it SHALL continue to query the same OTA Provider, again fol­ lowing the query timing constraints previously expressed.

#### Availability of Software Images

> The algorithm used by the Image Selection Logic to determine availability of a new Software Image SHALL consider all fields provided by the OTA Requestor and attempt to provide the newest match­ ing Software Image. The OTA Image Selection Logic SHALL only provide newer (numerically higher) SoftwareVersion than the SoftwareVersion sent in the query. See [Section 11.20.3.3.2, “Con­](#_bookmark1634) [ceptual algorithm for matching OTA Software Images applicable to a query”](#_bookmark1634) for more details.
>
> The OTA Provider MAY provide a Software Image that only conveys data for a subset of updateable components within the OTA Requestor’s Node. These cases of partial or componentized software updates are determined purely by the entity generating the OTA Software Image, and the OTA Provider SHALL never mutate the contents of an OTA Software Image.
>
> The original provider of a Software Image SHOULD be able to assume the contents of the Software Image will remain unchanged and signatures would remain valid. Therefore, an OTA Provider SHALL NOT modify the contents of any Software Images other than allowing that OTA Requestor to index into the Software Image using the [BDX Protocol](#bulk-data-exchange-protocol-bdx) or other supported download protocol, such that the OTA Requestor may obtain only the desired parts of the Software Image.
>
> The OTA Provider SHALL NOT hide or otherwise mask the contents of a Software Image available for transfer to a requestor.
>
> In order for different vendors to participate as widely as possible in the distribution of Software Images for the widest variety of products without requiring bilateral distribution agreements between each pair, it is RECOMMENDED for vendors to participate in distribution schemes that maximize availability across other vendors and OTA Providers.
>
> Vendors SHOULD build data sets aggregating the metadata and payloads of Software Images to sup­ port their OTA Image Selection Logic by any means they deem satisfactory. Vendors SHOULD refer to canonical databases, such as the [Distributed Compliance Ledger](#distributed-compliance-ledger).
>
> Given that most Fabrics likely will contain a reduced subset of Nodes capable of acting as OTA Providers compared to the larger set of vendors represented in the many deployed Nodes, it is advantageous to end-users that Vendors attempt to cover as many other vendors with their data sets. This will ensure that the majority of Software Image queries can be fulfilled if a vendor has released a newer version than that installed on the querying OTA Requestor.
>
> **Download Protocol selection**
>
> The OTA Image Selection Logic SHALL consider the OTA Requestor’s [supported download protocols](#_bookmark1648) to determine whether to respond to a [QueryImage command](#_bookmark1649).
>
> If either the BDXSynchronous or BDXAsynchronous protocols are supported by the OTA Requestor, the OTA Provider SHALL prefer to respond to the OTA Requestor with a BDX protocol URI, as long as it can fulfill the role of BDX server for the OTA Requestor.
>
> Otherwise, if the HTTPS protocol is supported by the OTA Requestor, and the OTA Provider deter­ mines that an OTA Software Image is available to fulfill the request from a server supporting HTTPS, it SHOULD respond with the direct source URI, so that the OTA Requestor MAY download it directly.
>
> Otherwise, if the VendorSpecific protocol is supported by the OTA Requestor, and the OTA Provider has sufficient knowledge of the OTA Requestor’s capabilities based on the [QueryImage command](#_bookmark1649) arguments, it SHOULD respond with a URI which is known to be understood by the OTA Requestor. It is RECOMMENDED to limit usage of this modality and prefer BDXSynchronous and BDXAsynchro­ nous.
>
> **Conceptual algorithm for matching OTA Software Images applicable to a query**
>
> An OTA Provider MAY use any of the fields of the [QueryImage command](#_bookmark1649) in any way it deems applicable to determine whether an appropriate OTA Software image is available for the OTA Requestor.
>
> However, to increase interoperability, OTA Providers which have access to the data present in the [Distributed Compliance Ledger (DCL)](#distributed-compliance-ledger), whether from cached subset or from a full replica, SHOULD employ at least the common conceptual algorithm provided in this section to determine whether an OTA Image is available.
>
> The information to access OTA Software Image locations for certified software versions is available in the [DCL](#distributed-compliance-ledger) [DeviceSoftwareVersionModel Schema](#devicesoftwareversionmodel-schema), which is indexed by VendorID, ProductID and SoftwareVersion.
>
> The inputs to the conceptual algorithm are:

- A subset of the fields of the [QueryImage command](#_bookmark1649) as a structure named requestor:

- [VendorID](#vendorid-field) of the requestor as vendorID

- [ProductID](#productid-field) of the requestor as productID

  - Current [SoftwareVersion](#softwareversion-field) of the requestor as softwareVersion

  - The list of all current entries for the given VendorID and ProductID from the DeviceSoftwareVer­ sionModel schema, ordered by SoftwareVersion, accounting for the following fields, as an array candidates\[\]

    - [SoftwareVersion](#softwareversion) of the entry as softwareVersion

    - [SoftwareVersionValid](#softwareversionvalid) of the entry as softwareVersionValid

    - [MinApplicableSoftwareVersion](#minapplicablesoftwareversion) of the entry as minApplicableSoftwareVersion

    - [MaxApplicableSoftwareVersion](#maxapplicablesoftwareversion) of the entry as maxApplicableSoftwareVersion

> The output of the conceptual algorithm is a tuple of:

- candidateWasFound, a boolean predicate indicating whether a newer version candidate was found

- softwareVersionFound, the version of the newer version candidate, if candidateWasFound was true, 0 otherwise.

> The algorithm is as follows:

1.  Assume no matching candidate found

    - candidateWasFound := False

    - softwareVersionFound := 0

2.  Obtain candidates from a DCL replica or from a DCL-based dataset for the given vendorID and

> productID in the query, keeping only entries where softwareVersionValid is true.

- An OTA Provider MAY as well filter available versions by certification compliance status (see [Section 11.23.8, “DeviceSoftwareCompliance / Compliance test result Schema”](#devicesoftwarecompliance-compliance-test-result-schema)).

3.  Sort all candidates by ascending softwareVersion.

4.  Iterate through all candidates to find all positive matches within the sorted candidates. A "posi­ tive match" is a candidate which fullfills every condition in the following list:

    - requestor.softwareVersion \< candidate.softwareVersion

    - requestor.softwareVersion ≥ candidate.minApplicableSoftwareVersion

    - requestor.softwareVersion ≤ candidate.maxApplicableSoftwareVersion

5.  From the positive matches, select the very last one of list, which will be the newest (numerically highest) possible softwareVersion that could be used. If no positive matches were found, no new software version is available.

> A pseudocode of the conceptual algorithm is presented below:

[TABLE]

[TABLE]

> If candidateWasFound was true, then a version matching (softwareVersionFound) was found and its location and associated metadata can be found in the [DeviceSoftwareVersionModel](#devicesoftwareversionmodel-schema) schema of the DCL.
>
> While the [QueryImage command](#_bookmark1649) MAY also contain the Location, HardwareVersion and Meta­ dataForProvider fields, they are optional to use by an OTA provider. These additional fields MAY assist an OTA provider in supporting field trial and development policies. The certified releases present in the DCL, however, are only indexed by VendorID, ProductID and SoftwareVersion, based on the associated certification.
>
> Once an OTA software update file location ([OtaUrl](#_bookmark1759)) and digest ([OtaChecksum](#_bookmark1760)) are found for the associated version candidate, an OTA provider MAY omit re-downloading the file, and serve a cached copy if a local copy of a file exists which matches all of the following constraints from the
>
> candidate:

- It has the same OtaChecksum

- It has the same OtaChecksumType

- It has the same OtaFileSize

#### Obtaining user consent for updating software

> In the following subsections, the word "User" SHALL be construed to mean "an entity with suffi­ cient privileges associated with the Fabric". For instance, this could be a home dweller having pre­ viously configured Nodes or other services and currently having privilege to further affect such configuration. The exact scope for what an "entity" for such a "User" role may be, and what "suffi­ cient privilege" means, SHALL be implementation-dependent.
>
> An OTA Provider SHOULD obtain some form of "User Consent" prior to responding with a URI for a Software Image or letting an OTA Requestor proceed with applying a previously downloaded update. In the context of the OTA Cluster, "User Consent" SHALL be defined as any signal that an OTA Provider may obtain through its implementation-specific logic, that conveys consent to pro­ ceed from a User administratively allowed to give such consent in an informed manner.
>
> Example of "User Consent" include:

- Triggering a notification to an interactive application user interface, where at least one User is notified of the availability of new software for a given node, and where a signal of approval to continue with the downloading and applying of that update can be conveyed back to the OTA Provider.

&nbsp;

- Example: An OTA Provider detects the local presence of a mobile device with an application supporting required User accounts through out-of-band means. The OTA Provider makes an implementation-specific request over a protocol of its choice, in-band or out-of-band of the Fabric, to obtain consent. The User is notified on screen with "An ExampleCompany Light Bulb needs update to version 1.2.3. Tap here for release notes. Do you want to proceed?". The User then selects "Agree to Update" and the signal is relayed back to the OTA Provider, which then proceeds.

  - Relaying of a previously stored consent signal, previously provided by a User at some point in the past. The original capture of the stored consent signal should have been made after having provided sufficient information to the User to understand the consequences of such stored con­ sent. Multiple signals, covering different Nodes, Vendors or Device Classes, may be stored inde­ pendently to affect a variety of deferred consent policies.

&nbsp;

- Example: An OTA Provider contacts an implementation-specific server with metadata about the OTA Requestor and details for available Software Images, and obtains a consent signal based on an Administrator having previously stated an account preference to "Always apply software updates to light bulbs". The OTA Provider then proceeds further.

> **User consent delegation to Nodes**
>
> Some capable Nodes MAY have sufficient hardware capabilities to request user consent by means such as display or voice, and subsequently recover user consent feedback through input mecha­
>
> nisms. These devices MAY request optional delegation of user consent by the following method:

1.  The OTA Requestor SHALL set the [RequestorCanConsent](#requestorcanconsent-field) field in the QueryImageRequest to True, indicating ability to obtain consent.

2.  The OTA Provider, if it determines that the best way to obtain user consent is to delegate to the OTA Requestor Node, SHALL include the [UserConsentNeeded](#userconsentneeded-field) field, with a value set to True in the QueryImageResponse, indicating that user consent was not previously obtained, and that delegation SHALL occur.

3.  The OTA Requestor, upon observing presence of [UserConsentNeeded](#userconsentneeded-field) field set to True and the availability of an image in the QueryImageResponse SHOULD proceed to obtain user consent using its onboard means, prior to transferring the OTA Software Image reported. If the UserCon­ sentNeeded field is set to False or absent, the OTA Requestor SHALL assume that the OTA Provider already obtained sufficient user consent during the querying phase.

> The above method of obtaining User Consent at the OTA Requestor level SHALL NOT be used if a Node is configured with the [LocalConfigDisabled](#localconfigdisabled-attribute) attribute set to True as reflected by the Basic Information Cluster.
>
> **User consent recommendations**
>
> Because of the variety of Vendors and Devices, the concept of "User Consent" will necessarily take many different forms. Therefore, it is RECOMMENDED that every implementer of OTA Provider logic implement a transparent and easy-to-use set of functionality to allow Users to provide or deny consent for software updates, in a way that functionally integrates with their products and respects the general requirements stated above. Implementation of this feature is expected to improve "user experience" and assist with building trust regarding the installation of new software on Nodes.
>
> It is RECOMMENDED that any method of consent that stores consent signals also provide a way to revoke this consent in the future.
>
> It is RECOMMENDED that metadata from Software Images be used to convey as much information as required within the available set, so that a User can make an informed decision based on the nature of the product being updated, the human-readable instance of the new version number (e.g. [SoftwareVersionString](#_bookmark1684) in OTA Image Header), the changes made available, and their side-effects on product functionality. Any URL for online contents conveyed during this process SHOULD point to content that can be localized at the time of delivery, whenever possible. The responsibility for the maintenance of such version information is on the Vendor providing the URL and metadata. The OTA Provider and associated implementation-specific logic SHALL allow a User to consent to an update, even if errors occur while trying to provide additional release information, as the metadata within the Software Image should suffice to provide a first-order description of the new version, which could then be researched or cross-referenced by the User.
>
> It is RECOMMENDED that Vendor-provided Software Update metadata, such as release note URLs, be maintained in the long-term with stable locations, preferably in a manner allowing historical caching by common online search engines, where applicable. See [Section 11.23.7.11,](#releasenotesurl) [“ReleaseNotesUrl”](#releasenotesurl) and [Section 11.21.2.4.8, “ReleaseNotesUrl field”](#_bookmark1688) for sources of such information.

#### Transfer of OTA Software Update images

> Execution of an OTA Software Update image’s transfer depends on the protocol provided in the [ImageURI](#imageuri-field) field of the query response.
>
> The following are OTA Software Image transfer examples:

- An OTA Requestor invokes a [QueryImage command](#_bookmark1649) stating only support for BDX in its Proto­ colsSupported. The OTA Provider, using its OTA Image Selection Logic, determines that a Soft­ ware Image is available. There are several cases to be considered:

1.  The Software Image is at a URI referring to a resource on the public Internet (e.g.

> <https://domain.example/images/software.bin>).

1.  The OTA Provider MAY completely download the Software Image, temporarily, to local storage. It would then reply to the OTA Requestor with a [locally-accessible BDX URI](#imageuri-field), such as bdx://8899AABBCCDDEEFF/software_8ce40aa1.bin. In that case, the OTA Requestor SHALL proceed with the download from the OTA Provider using the [BDX protocol](#bulk-data-exchange-protocol-bdx).

2.  The OTA Provider MAY employ a variety of buffering and proxying schemes of underly­ ing HTTPS transfers to support the OTA Requestor downloading in real-time as a form of direct proxy. It would immediately reply to the OTA Requestor with a [locally-accessible](#imageuri-field) [BDX URI](#imageuri-field), such as bdx://8899AABBCCDDEEFF/software_8ce40aa1.bin. In that case, the OTA Requestor SHALL proceed with the download from the OTA Provider using the [BDX pro­](#bulk-data-exchange-protocol-bdx) [tocol](#bulk-data-exchange-protocol-bdx). The only difference with the previous case is the fact that the transfer uses data directly proxied in real-time, as opposed to the OTA Requestor downloading a pre-stored cached copy of the same Software Image.

&nbsp;

2.  The Software Image is already cached on the OTA Provider, either from pre-seeding over some implementation-specific scheme, or from having previously served this software update to another OTA Requestor. In that case, the OTA Provider SHALL reply to the OTA Requestor with a [locally-accessible BDX URI](#imageuri-field), such as bdx://8899AABBCCDDEEFF/soft­ ware_8ce40aa1.bin. In that case, the OTA Requestor SHALL proceed with the download from the OTA Provider using the [BDX protocol](#bulk-data-exchange-protocol-bdx).

    - An OTA Requestor invokes a [QueryImage command](#_bookmark1649) stating support for BDX and HTTPS in its ProtocolsSupported. The OTA Provider, using its OTA Image Selection Logic, determines that a Software Image is available. The Software Image is at a URI referring to a resource on the public Internet (e.g. <https://domain.example/images/software.bin>). In the case of support for both HTTPS and BDX, all of the above cases are applicable, in addition to the following:

- The OTA Provider knows that the OTA Requestor supports HTTPS from the [QueryImage com­](#_bookmark1649) [mand](#_bookmark1649). The OTA Provider MAY then respond directly to the OTA Requestor with the <https://domain.example/images/software.bin> URI. The OTA Requestor SHALL proceed to download from the public Internet using the HTTPS protocol.

> As described above, an OTA Provider SHALL either proxy synchronously or asynchronously the actual Software Image data for [BDX Protocol](#bulk-data-exchange-protocol-bdx) clients, when a Software Image is determined to be available from the public Internet or from local storage.
>
> Upon receipt of a [QueryImageResponse command](#_bookmark1656) containing a [DelayedActionTime](#delayedactiontime-field) field, the OTA Requestor SHALL wait for at least the stated delay time before initiating the first part of a file trans­ fer for the URI provided.
>
> The OTA Provider MAY expunge any previously cached Software Image downloaded on behalf of other OTA Requestors, to save storage, at any time, as long as no transfer is currently in active progress. It is RECOMMENDED that OTA Providers on a given Fabric maintain as much Software Image cache as practical, to improve availability of software image and reduce latency between QueryImage requests and availability of the matching QueryImageResponse for a new Software Image ready to be downloaded.
>
> In order to support non-BDX protocols relying on the public Internet, or intranets, the OTA Requestor SHALL only report support for protocols requiring public Internet access if it has deter­ mined that it does indeed have access to the necessary network domains beyond the Fabric. The OTA Requestor MAY employ any method it deems satisfactory to determine public Internet reacha­ bility. Because of the variety of firewall and security policies on network infrastructure, it is REC­ OMMENDED that all Nodes whose primary networking interactions lie within protocols in-band of this wider specification support the BDX method, so that even if a Node cannot access the public Internet, it MAY still obtain OTA Software Images by relying on a local OTA Provider which can.
>
> For BDX transfers, the following BDX-specific constraints SHALL be followed:

- Receiver-Drive mode SHALL be used by the OTA Provider for any transfers initiated from a secure channel on non-TCP transport.

- Asynchronous mode SHALL be used by the OTA Provider for any transfer initiated from a secure channel on TCP transport.

- Idle time-out SHALL be no less than 5 minutes for either Receiver-Driver or Asynchronous mode, before aborting a transfer.

- Block sizes constraints SHALL be as follows:

  - Maximum Block Size over all transports SHALL be a power of two if the OTA Requestor requests a value larger than 128 bytes.

  - For an OTA Requestor-requested Maximum Block Size value between 16 and 128, the exact requested value SHALL be used. This constraint allows low-power Nodes to precisely control the block sizes to ensure their power constraints are respected, including enabling single- frame block transfers over communication mediums where MTU is very small.

  - Maximum Block Size requested by OTA Requestors over non-TCP transports SHALL be no larger than 1024 (2^10) bytes. OTA Providers SHALL support the Maximum Block Size of at least 1024 bytes in those cases.

  - Maximum Block Size requested by OTA Requestors over TCP transport SHALL be no larger than 8192 (2 ^ 13) bytes. OTA Providers SHALL support a Maximum Block Size of at least 4096 (2^12) bytes in this case and MAY support 8192 bytes.

  - Actual Block Size used over all transports SHALL be the negotiated Maximum Block Size for every block except the last one, which may be of any size less or equal to the Maximum Block Size (including zero).

- The OTA Requestor SHALL NOT rely on the ReceiveAccept message from the OTA Provider hav­ ing the RC\[DEFLEN\] bit set (see [Section 11.22.5.4.2.1, “ReceiveAccept](#_bookmark1717) [RC\[DEFLEN\]: definite length](#_bookmark1717) [present”](#_bookmark1717)) and the associated LEN field populated. Instead, OTA Requestors SHALL rely on OTA Software Image metadata to determine the expected size to download.

&nbsp;

- The ReceiveInit message from the OTA Requestor MAY have the RC\[STARTOFS\] bit set and asso­ ciated STARTOFS field set to indicate the resumption of a transfer previously aborted, or to affect partial windowed access to the portion of a Software Image desired.

- The ReceiveInit message from the OTA Requestor MAY have the RC\[DEFLEN\] bit set and associ­ ated DEFLEN field set to state the desired maximum size of the transfer.

> Since OTA Requestors MAY need to read Software Image in parts, it is RECOMMENDED that OTA Providers maintain cached Software Images for at least 5 minutes after closure of the last OTA Requestor transfer, so that the OTA Requestor MAY come back to read different parts of an OTA file.
>
> In the case of very large Fabrics, it often occurs that there is a large number of the same model of Node within a given location. Because of this, OTA Providers SHOULD avoid downloading the same Software Image repeatedly for proxying if it can determine that multiple OTA Requestors are requesting, or can be expected to request, the same Software Image.
>
> It is RECOMMENDED to keep Software Images cached for as long as practical to reduce having to reach external off-Fabric resources frequently to address the update needs of a large fleet of identi­ cal Nodes that could share a single pre-downloaded cached copy in the OTA Provider. This reduces burden on content delivery servers for Software Images and reduces the amount of data trans­ ferred by an OTA Provider from external off-Fabric servers to fulfill software update requirements.
>
> It is RECOMMENDED that Sleepy End Devices make their best effort to optimize their sleep intervals during the OTA Software Image transfer process over BDX to ensure that the download completes in a timely manner. However, it is acknowledged that some Sleepy End Devices might not be able to do so, due to limitations related to their batteries or other constrained power sources. Therefore, such devices MAY take much longer to complete the download process.
>
> In the case where a BDX transfer is aborted due to unforeseen circumstances (e.g. power loss, crash, battery drain on either side), the OTA Requestor MAY try to use a partial (i.e. range-based) transfer to recover and continue the download without having to start from the beginning of a given Soft­ ware Image. An OTA Requestor SHALL abort retrying a transfer after three attempts in a row where each yielded no forward progress.
>
> It is RECOMMENDED for the OTA Provider to validate the length and digest of proxied images whenever possible (see OTA software update file [Header field](#header-field)) to avoid continuing a transfer if the data is obviously corrupted.
>
> In any situation where an OTA Requestor reaches a terminal failure point for a Software Image transfer and all possible retries or alternate OTA Providers have been exhausted, that OTA Requestor SHALL reset its entire software updating state and revert to doing a future query at the next possible scheduled time, so that perhaps a new Software Image may be available again.
>
> The above situation may occur, for example, if an OTA Provider had cleared its Software Update Image File cache for any reason, or if there is a transient network failure of sufficient duration to prevent a complete transfer to take place.
>
> Once the entirety of a Software Image has been downloaded and is ready to apply, the OTA Requestor SHALL execute the ["Applying a software update"](#applying-a-software-update) sequence of the next section.

#### Applying a software update

> Once a Software Image has been fully downloaded based on a [QueryImageResponse command](#_bookmark1656), the OTA Requestor SHALL proceed with a sequence to determine when to apply the update by invoking the [ApplyUpdateRequest](#_bookmark1664) command.
>
> **UpdateToken usage**
>
> The OTA Requestor SHALL provide an [UpdateToken](#updatetoken-field-1) to the OTA Provider with the [ApplyUp­](#_bookmark1664) [dateRequest](#_bookmark1664) command. This token SHALL be a previously provided [UpdateToken](#updatetoken-field) from the last [QueryImageResponse](#_bookmark1656), unless the token was lost by the OTA Requestor. In case of token loss, the OTA Requestor SHALL use its [Operational Node ID](#node-identifier) encoded as a 64-bit value in network byte order. This UpdateToken MAY be used by an OTA Provider to track deferred OTA application or otherwise allow short-term tracking of OTA Requestors for algorithmic bookkeeping. The OTA Provider SHALL NOT consider an invalid UpdateToken as a reason to continuously deny or delay an OTA Requestor’s request to apply a Software Image.
>
> **Update application process**
>
> On receipt of the [ApplyUpdateRequest](#_bookmark1664) command, the OTA Provider SHALL respond with an action to be taken by the OTA Requestor before activating the new version. The method used to determine the [Action](#action-field) field of the response MAY be based on implementation-specific rules and logic.
>
> Note that the DelayedActionTime field is a relative time delay from the moment of receipt, which needs to be computed by the OTA Provider to reflect the difference between the OTA Provider’s cur­ rent time and the desired time for execution of the Action.
>
> In case of a successful invocation, the following actions to be taken by the OTA Requestor are possi­ ble, based on the [Action](#action-field) field in the [ApplyUpdateResponse command](#_bookmark1666):

- Proceed: Apply the update, taking in account the delay time stated in DelayedActionTime.

  - If the DelayedActionTime is zero, then the OTA Requestor SHALL apply the update without additional delay.

  - If the DelayedActionTime is non-zero, the OTA Requestor SHALL await at least DelayedAc­ tionTime seconds prior to applying the software update. An example use of this Action by an OTA Provider is to schedule application of a Software Image based on a user’s preferred update time for Nodes of a certain type (e.g. light bulbs or window coverings) to occur at a time when the user is not at home, or when the temporary unavailability of the Node during the update would not pose a problem.

  - When the Proceed action is given, the OTA Requestor SHALL NOT invoke the [ApplyUp­](#_bookmark1664) [dateRequest](#_bookmark1664) command again, unless the OTA Requestor suffers an error or unexpected con­ dition while proceeding to apply the new Software Image.

- AwaitNextAction: Await at least the given delay time in DelayedActionTime before re-invoking an [ApplyUpdateRequest](#_bookmark1664) to get a new Action.

  - If the DelayedActionTime is less than 120 seconds (2 minutes), the OTA Requestor SHALL assume a value of 120 seconds.

  - An example use of this Action by an OTA Provider is to schedule application of a Software

> Image based on non-occupancy of a room, which Nodes collaborating with the OTA Provider may be able to ascertain, but which may require several attempts over time.

- It is RECOMMENDED to keep usage of this Action to a practical minimum, as it may cause OTA Requestors to be delayed in their application of a Software Image.

- The AwaitNextAction action SHALL NOT be emitted in such a way as to cause more than 24 hours of delay in applying an available Software Image. It is expected that user consent hav­ ing been previously granted should satisfy the overall scheduling constraint this imposes.

&nbsp;

- Discontinue: The OTA Provider is conveying a desire to rescind a previously provided Software Image.

  - The DelayedActionTime SHALL be ignored by the OTA Requestor if present.

  - The OTA Requestor SHOULD clear its previously downloaded and verified Software Image, if it had been obtained from the same OTA Provider as the one providing the Discontinue action.

  - This action SHALL only be used as a stopgap when it is known that a given Software Image previously provided may cause significant negative side-effects to an OTA Requestor, such as unrecoverable loss of functionality, or other damage.

  - In case of receiving this action unexpectedly (e.g. from a different OTA Provider than the one where a Software Image was downloaded), an OTA Requestor MAY ignore it and con­ sider it the same way as if the [ApplyUpdateRequest command](#_bookmark1664) had proceeded with an error.

> It is RECOMMENDED that for any OTA Requestor invoking the [ApplyUpdateRequest command](#_bookmark1664) with an unknown UpdateToken, the OTA Provider SHOULD assume that the OTA Requestor has a Soft­ ware Image ready to apply and thus respond with the Proceed or Await action, rather than responding with an error or Discontinue action.
>
> In case of time-out or any error in obtaining an answer to the ApplyUpdateRequest command, or in case of a restart or other unrecoverable situation while awaiting the DelayedActionTime for a Pro­ ceed or Await action, the OTA Requestor SHOULD retry to execute the "Querying the OTA Provider" flow (see [Section 11.20.3.2, “Querying the OTA Provider”](#querying-the-ota-provider)) again, whenever the OTA Requestor deems it possible.
>
> In case of failure of every possible retry mechanism for at least 3 total attempts, or over more than 24 hours, an OTA Requestor having successfully downloaded and verified a Software Image MAY apply the update. This measure of last recourse is to avoid situations where a critical issue affecting a particular software version would prevent an OTA Requestor or OTA Provider from properly exe­ cuting the "Applying a Software Update" flow, thus leaving an OTA Requestor in reduced or a for­ ever-impaired state that could otherwise be resolved by applying the Software Image it had suc­ cessfully downloaded and verified.
>
> After completion of an update, an OTA Requestor SHOULD invoke a NotifyUpdateApplied command to the OTA Provider which provided the initial query response to indicate that the OTA Requestor has successfully applied the OTA Software Update Image. The OTA Requestor SHALL NOT retry at the application level to invoke this command if a response is not received.

### Security considerations

> Security for the OTA Software Update capabilities encompasses these areas: Software Image verifi­ cation, Software Image transport, and Software Image encryption. Security mechanisms in given applications dictate the security level of OTA upgrading. For example, an application with strict security policies (such as a smart lock) MAY support Software Image encryption at rest beyond the secure channel data-in-transit encryption, while other applications MAY only support data-in-tran­ sit encryption. Each Vendor SHALL decide the list of required security policies for their use of the OTA Software Update capabilities for a particular product.

#### Image Encryption

> A Vendor MAY apply at-rest encryption to Software Image bodies, excluding the Software Update Image Header, using any algorithm of its choosing.
>
> It is out of scope of this specification to mandate such means of protecting the confidentiality of the Software Images.

#### Image Verification

> **Asymmetric Verification of Authenticity and Integrity**
>
> The verification of the authenticity and integrity of Software Images by OTA Requestors is manda­ tory for security reasons. This is most often accomplished through asymmetric encryption technolo­ gies where only one entity is able to create a digital signature but many entities are able to verify it. Software Images SHALL be signed by a private key used by the Vendor for software image signing purposes, with that signature attached to the Software Image that is transported to the OTA Requestor. Once the complete Software Image has been received, the signature SHALL be verified using a matching public key known to the OTA Requestor performing the validation. See [Section](#firmware) [13.5, “Firmware”](#firmware) for the associated security requirements. The format and algorithms used for code signatures verification are out of scope of this specification. The OTA Provider SHOULD NOT expect to be able to validate OTA Software Image signatures on its own.
>
> OTA Requestors MAY be pre-installed with the certificate (public key) of the entity that created the signature, or they MAY receive the certificate over-the-air. How the signer’s security data is obtained is considered outside the scope of the OTA Software Update Cluster and is Vendor Specific. When signer certificates are sent over-the-air, they SHALL be securely transferred from a trusted source to reduce the chance an attacker MAY inject their own signer certificate into the OTA Requestor.
>
> Software Images with verification mechanisms built in MAY be transported over insecure commu­ nication mechanisms while still maintaining their authenticity and integrity. In fact, it is likely that the originator of the Software Image (a Vendor) will not be directly connected to any Fabric and therefore distribute the Software Image across other mediums (such as the Internet) before arriv­ ing on the Fabric. Therefore, it is crucial that the Software Image verification be independent of the communication medium. Any attempts to tamper with the signature or the data itself SHALL be detected and SHALL cause the Software Image to be rejected by the target OTA Requestor. A Soft­ ware Image from an attacker that crafts its own signed image and tries to have it accepted would be rejected since that image will not be signed by the Vendor’s signing authority.
>
> Since Software Images MAY contain software for multiple sub-components (e.g. main processor firmware, radio firmware, graphical/audio assets) which MAY each employ different code signing keys, Software Images SHOULD provide at least an overall authenticity and integrity validation for the entire image, regardless of how it is segmented.
>
> Individual Vendors MAY augment the basic security and authenticity schemes provided by the Soft­ ware Images and provide their own extensions within the payloads. Those extensions are outside the scope of the OTA Software Update Cluster.
>
> Software Images MAY be encrypted with symmetric keys such that only those OTA Requestors that need to decrypt the Software Image have access to the key. This MAY be used to mask or obfuscate the contents of Software Images from intermediate network participants conveying the Software Images, while in transit and at rest. However, the security of this system is dependent on the secu­ rity of all OTA Requestors that have access to the symmetric key and the method of storage of the final Software Image at rest on a given OTA Requestor. The schemes employed by different Vendors to encrypt the body of Software Images in transit and at rest, is outside of the scope of this specifica­ tion.

### Some special situations

> With the mechanisms provided by this Cluster, roll-out of new Software Images applies equally to all OTA Requestors of matching a given \<VendorID, ProductID\> tuple, uniformly across the world. The subsections below describe two situations where finer-grained roll-out can be achieved for some regions or to distribute special non-standard versions.

#### Regional roll-out of Software Images

> Some Manufacturers have a policy of rolling-out by region (i.e. set of countries), to provide world- wide release schedule differentiation, as well as to test roll-outs gradually, among other reasons. These regional roll-outs may only be feasible using manufacturer-specific schemes that are in addi­ tion to the common flows described in this cluster. Common recommended behavior (see [Section](#_bookmark1634) [11.20.3.3.2, “Conceptual algorithm for matching OTA Software Images applicable to a query”](#_bookmark1634)) does not support regional roll-out since there does not exist a location tagging attribute in the [Distrib­](#distributed-compliance-ledger) [uted Compliance Ledger (DCL)](#distributed-compliance-ledger). For regional rolls-outs prior to full roll-out, refer to the overall tech­ niques described in [Section 11.20.5.2, “Roll-out of non-standard Software Images”](#roll-out-of-non-standard-software-images).

#### Roll-out of non-standard Software Images

> Many Manufacturers conduct field trials to test different versions of software (e.g. A/B-testing, beta testing), or provide dedicated Software Images to a subset of Nodes to affect particular diagnosis tasks, etc. The mechanism described in this cluster is not particularly well-suited for such fine- grained deployment (unless the OTA Provider is provided by, or associated with, the Manufacturer).
>
> To achieve more targeted roll-out, Vendors MAY commission a Node on the same Fabric as the devices requiring the special rules, so that it MAY provide OTA Provider capabilities beyond the core interoperable aspects of this Cluster. Finer-grained selection MAY be applied by special OTA Software Image Selection logic in a given OTA Provider, using the [MetadataForProvider](#metadataforprovider-field) field and [MetadataForRequestor](#metadataforrequestor-field) fields of the [QueryImage](#_bookmark1649) command. Furthermore, such special OTA Provider may identify itself by including the [MetadataForNode](#metadatafornode-field) field in a given [AnnounceO­](#_bookmark1675)
>
> [TAProvider](#_bookmark1675) command.
>
> If such a special Software Image is running on an OTA Requestor, the OTA Requestor MAY reject Software Images provided to it by an OTA Provider on the Fabric, to prevent loss of the non-stan­ dard Software Image. A Factory Data Reset of the OTA Requestor SHALL remove such override.

#### Other considerations

> While it is expected that Nodes fulfilling the role of OTA Provider will likely have high availability within the Fabric, it may be possible some will be battery-operated or be power-cycled frequently. It is RECOMMENDED that an OTA Provider Node that determines it cannot reliably stay available to service OTA Requestors SHOULD avoid responding with an available OTA Software Image when responding to a QueryImage command (see [QueryImageResponse](#_bookmark1656)) unless it has sufficient availabil­ ity to allow a long-running [BDX Protocol](#bulk-data-exchange-protocol-bdx) transfer to finish. In general, OTA Provider role SHOULD be fulfilled by a Node with a reliable network availability and stable power, especially if it is set as a default in the [DefaultOTAProviders](#_bookmark1673) attribute.

#### VendorID Field

> The value SHALL be the Vendor ID applying to the OTA Requestor’s Node and SHALL match the value reported by the [Basic Information Cluster VendorID](#vendorid-attribute) attribute.

#### ProductID Field

> The value SHALL be the Product ID applying to the OTA Requestor’s Node and SHALL match the value reported by the [Basic Information Cluster ProductID](#productid-attribute) attribute.

#### SoftwareVersion Field

> The SoftwareVersion included in the request payload SHALL provide the value representing the current version running on the OTA Requestor invoking the command. This version SHALL be equal to the [Software Version attribute](#softwareversion-attribute) of the [Basic Information Cluster](#basic-information-cluster).

#### ProtocolsSupported Field

> This field SHALL contain a list of all download protocols supported by the OTA Requestor.
>
> This field SHALL be used by the OTA Provider to generate the correct URI for the location of the Software Image when one is found to be available. The values of BDX Synchronous and BDX Asyn­ chronous SHALL always be supported by an OTA Provider. Furthermore, OTA Providers with access to external networking SHOULD support the HTTPS protocol. OTA Providers MAY support other protocols.
>
> The algorithm to select the specific protocol to use in a given Software Image URI is implementa­ tion-dependent, provided that the rules in [Section 11.20.3.3.1, “Download Protocol selection”](#_bookmark1633) are fol­ lowed.
>
> See [Section 11.20.3.2, “Querying the OTA Provider”](#querying-the-ota-provider) and [Section 11.20.3.5, “Transfer of OTA Software](#transfer-of-ota-software-update-images) [Update images”](#transfer-of-ota-software-update-images) for more details about usage of this field.

#### HardwareVersion Field

> The value of this field, if present, SHALL contain the OTA Requestor’s hardware version, and SHALL be equal to the [HardwareVersion attribute](#hardwareversion-attribute) of the [Basic Information Cluster](#basic-information-cluster).

#### Location Field

> The location, if present, SHALL provide the same value as the [Basic Information Cluster Location](#location-attribute)
>
> attribute for the OTA Requestor as configured. This MAY be used by the OTA Provider logic to allow per-region selection of the Software Image.

#### RequestorCanConsent Field

> This field SHALL be set to true by an OTA Requestor that is capable of obtaining user consent for OTA application by virtue of built-in user interface capabilities. Otherwise, it SHALL be false.
>
> See [Section 11.20.3.4, “Obtaining user consent for updating software”](#obtaining-user-consent-for-updating-software) for application details about usage.

#### MetadataForProvider Field

> This optional field, if present, SHALL consist of a [top-level](#scope-purpose-5) [anonymous](#anonymous-tags) [list](#lists); each list element SHALL have a [profile-specific](#profile-specific-tags) tag encoded in [fully-qualified](#fully-qualified-tag-form) form. Each list element SHALL contain a man­ ufacturer-specific payload, which the OTA Requestor invoking this command wants to expose to the receiving OTA Provider. This payload MAY be used for any purpose and SHOULD be as small as practical.
>
> The use of this field SHOULD be restricted to Vendor-specific usage and SHALL NOT be used as a selector required to match for the selection of a Software Image in production environments, unless absolutely necessary, as the interpretation of this field may be ambiguous to OTA Providers implementing the Cluster in a compliant but divergent way from the sender.
>
> An example of usage for this field is for an OTA Requestor to provide specific data about grouping or authentication in field trial environments, where the OTA Provider is likely to understand it and be able to act upon it, either for special selection of image, or recording of activity.
>
> An OTA Provider SHALL report the availability of Software Images, if one is found to be applicable using the other provided fields, even if the MetadataForProvider field is deemed to contain invalid or unknown information. That is, the contents of the MetadataForProvider field SHALL NOT be used to deny a software update to an OTA Requestor, unless both OTA Requestor and OTA Provider have an externally agreed-upon policy whereby strictly correct additional MetadataForProvider is expected to fulfill the OTA Software Update process.

#### Usage of the QueryImage Command

> OTA Requestors SHALL send a QueryImage command to the OTA Provider to determine the avail­ ability of a new Software Image.

#### Status Field

> This field SHALL contain the primary response regarding the availability of a Software Image.
>
> See [Section 11.20.3.2, “Querying the OTA Provider”](#querying-the-ota-provider) for details about the possible values for this field and their meaning.

#### DelayedActionTime Field

> This field SHALL convey the minimum time to wait, in seconds from the time of this response, before sending another QueryImage command or beginning a download from the OTA Provider. OTA Requestors SHALL respect this minimum delay, unless they had previously restarted and lost track of it. OTA Providers SHOULD expect OTA Requestors to follow this value to their best capabil­ ity, however, a restarting Node MAY come back sooner, due to having lost track of this state response.
>
> The DelayedActionTime field SHALL only be present if the Status field is set to [Busy](#_bookmark1646).
>
> See [Section 11.20.3.2, “Querying the OTA Provider”](#querying-the-ota-provider) for details about the rules regarding this field.

#### ImageURI Field

> This field, when present, SHALL contain a URI where the OTA Requestor SHOULD download a Soft­ ware Image. The syntax of the ImageURI field SHALL follow the URI syntax as specified in [RFC 3986](#_bookmark47).
>
> This field SHALL be present if it appears in a QueryImageResponse with a Status of UpdateAvail­ able.
>
> If the ImageURI specifies a [BDX Protocol](#bulk-data-exchange-protocol-bdx) bdx: scheme, then the following rules describe the location to be used for download:

1.  The URI’s scheme field SHALL be exactly bdx in lowercase characters.

2.  The URI’s authority field SHALL contain only the host portion and SHALL use string representa­ tion of the [Operational Node ID](#node-identifier) of the Node where to proceed with the download, on the same Fabric on which the OTA Requestor received the QueryImageResponse.

3.  The encoding of the Node ID in the host field SHALL use an uppercase hexadecimal format, using exactly 16 characters to encode the network byte order value of the NodeID, in a similar fashion as the Node Identifier portion of the [Operational Instance Name](#operational-instance-name).

    1.  The Operational Node ID in the host field SHALL match the NodeID of the OTA Provider responding with the QueryImageResponse. The usage of a different Node ID than that of the provider is reserved for future use. This constraint reduces the number of independent [CASE](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case) secure channel sessions that have to be maintained to proceed with OTA software updates, thus reducing energy and resource utilization for the software update process.

4.  The user section of the authority field SHALL be absent, as there are no "users" to be considered.

5.  The port section of the authority field SHALL be absent, as the port for transport SHALL be determined through [Operational Discovery](#operational-discovery) of the target Node.

6.  The URI SHALL NOT contain a query field.

7.  The URI SHALL NOT contain a fragment field.

8.  The path field SHALL employ absolute path representation and SHALL contain the [file designa­](#_bookmark1712) [tor](#_bookmark1712) of the software image to download at the BDX server. When used with the BDX server, the leading / separating the URI authority from the path SHALL be omitted. When contacting the BDX server, further processing of the file designator SHALL NOT be done, including handling of URL-encoded escape sequences. Rather, the exact octets of the path, as received SHALL be the values used by both client and server in handling the file designator.

    1.  The path SHALL only contain valid URI characters.

> These rules above for BDX URIs simplify parsing for OTA Requestors receiving Image URIs. The fol­ lowing example procedure shows how the format constraints simplify the extraction of the neces­ sary data to reach the BDX server for download.

1.  Verify that the URI is 24 characters or longer, which is the minimum length of a valid BDX URI with all elements present, for example bdx://00112233AABBCCDD/0.

2.  Verify the presence of prefix bdx:// indicating a BDX URI.

3.  Extract the next 16 characters and convert from uppercase hexadecimal to a 64-bit scalar value, considering network byte order. This is the destination Node ID.

4.  Verify the presence of a path separator / and skip it.

5.  Extract the remaining characters of the string as the [file designator](#_bookmark1712) to employ when initiating the BDX transfer.

> Example ImageURI values are below, and illustrate some but not all of valid and invalid cases:

- Synchronous or Asynchronous [BDX Protocol](#bulk-data-exchange-protocol-bdx):

  - Valid: bdx://8899AABBCCDDEEFF/the_file_designator123

    - Node ID: 0x8899AABBCCDDEEFF

    - File designator: the_file_designator123

  - Valid: bdx://0099AABBCCDDEE77/the%20file%20designator/some_more

    - Node ID: 0x0099AABBCCDDEE77

    - File designator: the%20file%20designator/some_more. Note that the %20 are retained and not converted to ASCII 0x20 (space). The file designator is the path as received verbatim, after the first '/' (U+002F / SOLIDUS) following the host.

  - Invalid: bdx://99AABBCCDDEE77/the_file_designator123

    - Node ID: Invalid since it is not exactly 16 characters long, due to having omitted leading zeros.

  - Invalid: bdx://0099aabbccddee77/the_file_designator123

    - Node ID: Invalid since lowercase hexadecimal was used.

  - Invalid: bdx:8899AABBCCDDEEFF/the_file_designator123

    - Invalid since bdx scheme does not contain an authority, that is, it does not have // after the first :.

&nbsp;

- HTTP over TLS:

  - Valid: https://example.domain:8466/software/image.bin

> This optional field, if present, SHALL consist of a [top-level](#scope-purpose-5) [anonymous](#anonymous-tags) [list](#lists); each list element SHALL have a [profile-specific](#profile-specific-tags) tag encoded in [fully-qualified](#fully-qualified-tag-form) form. Each list element SHALL contain a man­ ufacturer-specific payload, which the OTA Provider wants to expose to the receiving OTA Requestor. This payload MAY be used for any purpose and SHOULD be as small as practical.
>
> The presence of this field SHALL NOT be required for correct operation of any OTA Provider com­ pliant with this Cluster specification.
>
> The data for this field does not exist in any [Distributed Compliance Ledger](#distributed-compliance-ledger) record and SHOULD only be emitted by an OTA Provider with this additional knowledge if it has knowledge that the receiving OTA Requestor MAY be able to use it.

#### UpdateToken Field

> This field SHALL contain the UpdateToken as specified in [Section 11.20.3.6.1, “UpdateToken usage”](#_bookmark1640). This field MAY be used by the OTA Provider to track minimal lifecycle state to allow finer-grained scheduling of the application of Software Images by OTA Requestors.

#### NewVersion Field

> The NewVersion field included in the request payload SHALL provide the SoftwareVersion value of the new Software Image which the OTA Requestor is ready to start applying. The OTA Provider MAY use this new version to track or record Software Image application by OTA Requestors.

#### When Generated

> The ApplyUpdateRequest Command SHALL be invoked by an OTA Requestor once it is ready to apply a previously downloaded Software Image.

#### Effect on Receipt

> Upon receipt of this command the OTA Provider SHALL respond with an Action field consistent with the next action the OTA Requestor should take, including any possible time delay.
>
> The OTA Provider SHALL NOT refer to previously stored state about any download progress to reply. If any state keeping is done by the OTA Provider, it SHALL only relate to the UpdateToken and the history of prior ApplyUpdateRequest commands.
>
> See [Section 11.20.3.6, “Applying a software update”](#applying-a-software-update) for a description of the flow in response to an OTA Provider receiving an invocation of this command.

#### Handling Error Cases

> See [Section 11.20.3.6, “Applying a software update”](#applying-a-software-update) for all error-handling information.

#### Action Field

> The Action field SHALL express the action that the OTA Provider requests from the OTA Requestor. See [Section 11.20.3.6, “Applying a software update”](#applying-a-software-update) for a description of the Action values provided in response to an OTA Provider receiving an invocation of this command.

#### DelayedActionTime Field

> The minimum time period the OTA Requestor SHALL wait before executing the Action, in seconds from receipt.
>
> If this field has a value higher than 86400 seconds (24 hours), then the OTA Requestor MAY assume a value of 86400, in order to reduce undue Software Image application delays.

| 1 | **Software­ Version** | uint32 | all |  |  | M |

#### UpdateToken Field

> This field SHALL contain the UpdateToken as specified in [Section 11.20.3.6.1, “UpdateToken usage”](#_bookmark1640).

#### SoftwareVersion Field

> The SoftwareVersion included in the request payload SHALL provide the same value as the [Soft­](#softwareversion-attribute) [wareVersion](#softwareversion-attribute) attribute in the invoking OTA Requestor’s [Basic Information Cluster](#basic-information-cluster), and SHOULD be consistent with the value representing a new version running on the Node invoking the command.

#### When Generated

> The NotifyUpdateApplied command SHOULD be invoked in the following two circumstances:

1.  An OTA Requestor has just successfully applied a Software Image it had obtained from a previ­ ous [QueryImage response](#_bookmark1656).

2.  An OTA Requestor has just successfully applied a Software Image it had obtained through means different than those of this Cluster.

> An OTA Provider MAY use the state of invocation of this command to help track the progress of update for OTA Requestors it knows require a new OTA Software Image. However, due to the possi­ bility that an OTA Requestor MAY never come back (e.g. device removed from Fabric altogether, or a critical malfunction), an OTA Provider SHALL NOT expect every OTA Requestor to invoke this command for correct operation of the OTA Provider.
>
> This command SHALL be considered optional and SHALL NOT result in reduced availability of the OTA Provider functionality if OTA Requestors never invoke this command.

#### Effect on Receipt

> An OTA Provider receiving an invocation of this command MAY log it internally.
>
> On receiving this command, an OTA Provider MAY use the information to update its bookkeeping of cached Software Images, or use it for other similar administrative purposes.

| **Value** | **Name** | **Summary** | **Conformance** |
|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | **SimpleAnnouncement** | An OTA Provider is announcing its pres­ ence. | M |
| 1 | **UpdateAvailable** | An OTA Provider is announcing, either to a single Node or to a group of Nodes, that a new Software Image MAY be available. | M |
| 2 | **UrgentUpdateAvail­ able** | An OTA Provider is announcing, either to a single Node or to a group of Nodes, that a new Software Image MAY be available, which contains an update that needs to be applied urgently. | M |

#### SimpleAnnouncement Value

> An OTA Provider is announcing its presence, but there is no implication that an OTA Requestor would have a new Software Image available if it queried immediately.

#### UpdateAvailable Value

> An OTA Provider is announcing, either to a single Node or to a group of Nodes, that a new Software Image MAY be available. The details may only be obtained by executing a [OTA Software Update](#querying-the-ota-provider) [Query](#querying-the-ota-provider) procedure. A receiving OTA Requestor SHOULD only query the indicated OTA Provider at the ProviderLocation at its next upcoming OTA Provider query.

#### UrgentUpdateAvailable Value

> An OTA Provider is announcing, either to a single Node or to a group of Nodes, that a new Software Image MAY be available, which contains an update that needs to be applied urgently. The details may only be obtained by executing a [OTA Software Update Query](#querying-the-ota-provider) procedure. A receiving OTA Requestor SHOULD query the indicated OTA Provider at the ProviderLocation after a random jitter delay between 1 and 600 seconds. This particular reason SHOULD only be employed when an urgent update is available, such as an important security update, or just after initial commissioning of a device, to assist OTA Requestors in more rapidly obtaining updated software.

#### VendorID Field

> This field SHALL contain the assigned Vendor ID of the Node invoking this command, as it would appear in that Node’s [Basic Information Cluster VendorID](#vendorid-attribute) attribute.

#### AnnouncementReason Field

> This field SHALL contain a value expressing the reason for the announcement.

#### MetadataForNode Field

> This optional field, if present, SHALL consist of a [top-level](#scope-purpose-5) [anonymous](#anonymous-tags) [list](#lists); each list element SHALL have a [profile-specific](#profile-specific-tags) tag encoded in [fully-qualified](#fully-qualified-tag-form) form. Each list element SHALL contain a man­ ufacturer-specific payload, which the Node invoking this command wants to expose to the receiving Node. This payload MAY be used for any purpose and SHOULD be as small as practical, especially if invoked to groups, in order to reduce networking burden of these payloads.
>
> This field SHOULD only be included if the sending OTA Provider has knowledge that some recipient can make use of it.

#### Endpoint Field

> This field SHALL contain the endpoint number which has the OTA Provider device type and OTA Software Update Provider cluster server on the ProviderNodeID. This is provided to avoid having to do discovery of the location of that endpoint by walking over all endpoints and checking their [Descriptor Cluster](#descriptor-cluster).

#### When Generated

> An OTA Provider MAY invoke this command directly to an OTA Requestor, to announce its presence as an OTA Provider on the Fabric.
>
> These announcements, if made, SHOULD be made at most once every 24 hours for any given target Node, to assist OTA Requestors in discovering available OTA Provider resources, unless the AnnouncementReason is UrgentUpdateAvailable, in which case this command MAY be more fre­
>
> quent.
>
> Any invocation SHALL be made with a delay of at least 1 second between invocations from a given OTA Provider, to reduce burden on the networking infrastructure and affect a form of serialized jit­ ter. It is RECOMMENDED to offset the first announcement of a round (i.e. new set of announce­ ments after a previous complete set) by a random delay time with a distribution span of \>= 60 sec­ onds to jitter announcement schedules over time.

#### Effect on Receipt

> On receipt of this command, an OTA Requestor SHOULD consider the new ProviderNodeID and AnnouncementReason to possibly query for new software sooner than it would have with its default behavior.
>
> The OTA Requestor SHOULD NOT update entries in the [DefaultOTAProviders](#_bookmark1673) list based on announcements.
>
> The receiving Node MAY ignore the content of the announcement if it is unable or unwilling to fur­ ther query OTA Providers temporarily, or if its provider list is full. If the announcement is ignored, the response SHOULD be SUCCESS.
>
> Depending on the value of the AnnouncementReason field, the OTA Requestor MAY have to query the OTA Provider. See [Section 11.20.7.6.1.3, “AnnouncementReason Field”](#announcementreason-field) for the different values and their meaning.
>
> If present, the [MetadataForNode](#metadatafornode-field) field’s MAY be used by a receiving OTA Requestor in any way it deems satisfactory. The MetadataForNode field SHOULD be empty under most normal operational circumstance, but can be useful in environments such as field trials or integration test environ­ ments to hint at additional capabilities which OTA Requestors MAY use in a particular Vendor-spe­ cific context.

## Over-the-Air (OTA) Software Update File Format

### Scope & Purpose

> The majority of devices will undergo an over-the-air (OTA) software update at some point during their operational lifecycle. It cannot be assumed that the Node responsible for serving OTA updates (OTA Provider) has any specific knowledge about the internals of OTA Requestor Nodes that are receiving OTA updates. This section provides a standardized header that SHALL be included in all OTA Software Images, in order to provide the necessary information for OTA Providers to validate images available for a given OTA Requestor.
>
> It should be noted that while this specification standardizes an OTA Software Image header that SHALL be used by all OTA Software Images, this specification does not further attempt to standard­ ize the remaining contents of those files.

### General Structure

> The OTA Software Image file format is composed of a header followed by an opaque body. The header describes general information about the file such as software version, and the [Vendor ID](#vendor-identifier-vendor-id-vid) and [Product ID](#product-identifier-product-id-pid) for which the image applies, see [Section 11.20.3.3.2, “Conceptual algorithm for](#_bookmark1634) [matching OTA Software Images applicable to a query”](#_bookmark1634)).
>
> OTA Software Image files SHALL use a fixed encoding. Individual fields of the OTA Software Image file may be comprised of more complex data types that utilize other encoding schemes.
>
> The fields that comprise an OTA Software Image file, listed in the sequential order in which they SHALL appear, are provided below.
>
> *Table 87. OTA Software Image File Layout*

[TABLE]

#### FileIdentifier field

> The FileIdentifier field is a fixed-width, little-endian-encoded, unsigned 32-bit value that SHALL be included at the beginning of all OTA software image files in order to quickly identify and distin­ guish the file as being of that format, without having to examine the contents of the whole file. This helps distinguishing the file from other file types in storage. The fixed constant value is defined to be 0x1BEEF11E.

#### TotalSize field

> The TotalSize field is a fixed-width, little-endian-encoded, unsigned 64-bit value that SHALL indi­ cate the total size, in bytes, of the entire file, including all fields and Payload. This field SHALL match the total stored size of the file. It SHALL match the sum of:

- The sizes of the FileIdentifier, TotalSize, and HeaderSize fields.

- The value of the HeaderSize field of this header.

- The value of the PayloadSize field of the Header subfield.

> For example, given:

- Size of total Header structure is 105 bytes, reflected as HeaderSize = 105

- Payload size is 128KiB = 128 \* 1024 bytes = 131072 bytes, reflected as Header.PayloadSize = 131072

> Then the TotalSize would be the sum of:

- the size of the FileIdentifier, TotalSize, and HeaderSize fields: 4 + 8 + 4 = 16 bytes

- the HeaderSize value = 105 bytes

- the Header.PayloadSize value = 131072 bytes

> This would give a total of 16 + 105 + 131072 = 131193 bytes. The overall file SHALL have this size and no more, and the TotalSize field SHALL contain that value.

#### HeaderSize field

> The HeaderSize field is fixed-width, little-endian-encoded, unsigned 32-bit value that SHALL indi­ cate the total size, in bytes, of the TLV-encoded Header field.

#### Header field

> The Header is a [TLV](#appendix-a-tag-length-value-tlv-encoding-format) structure, encoded with anonymous outer tag, with the following format:

> **VendorID field**
>
> The VendorID field SHALL be used by an OTA Provider to determine if a Node is the intended recip­ ient of the OTA software update file by checking that the VendorID field in the OTA software update file matches the [VendorID](#vendorid-field) received in the [Query Image command](#_bookmark1649) from the OTA Requestor. This VendorID field MAY be zero, in which case this OTA software update file MAY apply to more than one vendor.
>
> **ProductID field**
>
> The ProductID field MAY be used by an OTA Provider to determine if a Node is the intended recipi­ ent of the OTA software update file by checking that the ProductID field in the OTA software update file matches the [ProductID](#productid-field) received in the [Query Image command](#_bookmark1649) from the OTA Requestor. This ProductID field MAY be zero, in which case this OTA software update file MAY apply to more than one product.
>
> **SoftwareVersion field**
>
> The SoftwareVersion field SHALL contain a totally orderable scalar representation of the version for the software contained within the file. The SoftwareVersion value SHOULD NOT be displayed to an end-user.
>
> For a given version, this SoftwareVersion field SHALL match what the Node will report in its [Soft­](#softwareversion-attribute) [wareVersion attribute](#softwareversion-attribute) in the [Basic Information Cluster](#basic-information-cluster), once executing the version.
>
> **SoftwareVersionString field**
>
> The SoftwareVersionString field SHALL contain a human readable (displayable) representation of the version for the software contained within the file. The SoftwareVersionString value SHALL NOT be used by an OTA Provider to determine if the OTA software update file contains a newer image than what is currently running on a Node. The SoftwareVersionString value SHOULD be displayed to an end-user when communicating an identification for the software version.
>
> Format constraints for this field SHALL match the constraints of the [SoftwareVersionString](#softwareversionstring-attribute) [attribute](#softwareversionstring-attribute) in the [Basic Information Cluster](#basic-information-cluster).
>
> For a given version, this SoftwareVersionString field SHALL match what the Node will report in its [SoftwareVersionString attribute](#softwareversionstring-attribute) in the [Basic Information Cluster](#basic-information-cluster), once executing the version.
>
> **PayloadSize field**
>
> The PayloadSize field SHALL indicate the total size, in bytes, of the payload contained within this OTA software update file, beyond the header. The length of all data beyond the terminating byte of the header structure SHALL be equal to this field’s value.
>
> **MinApplicableSoftwareVersion field**
>
> The MinApplicableSoftwareVersion field, if present, SHALL be used by an OTA Provider to deter­ mine if the OTA Software Image is suitable for the Node, by checking that the MinApplicableSoft­ wareVersion field in the OTA software update file is less than or equal to the [SoftwareVersion](#softwareversion-field) received in the [Query Image command](#_bookmark1649) from the OTA Requestor.
>
> **MaxApplicableSoftwareVersion field**
>
> The MaxApplicableSoftwareVersion field, if present, SHALL be used by an OTA Provider to deter­ mine if the OTA Software Image is suitable for the Node, by checking that the MaxApplicableSoft­ wareVersion field in the OTA software update file is greater than or equal to the [SoftwareVersion](#softwareversion-field) received in the [Query Image command](#_bookmark1649) from the OTA Requestor.
>
> **ReleaseNotesUrl field**
>
> The ReleaseNotesUrl field, if present, SHOULD specify a link to a product specific web page that contains release notes for the OTA software update file. The specified URL SHOULD resolve to a maintained web page available at that URL for the lifetime of the software version’s availability. The syntax of this field SHALL follow the syntax as specified in [RFC 1738](#_bookmark43) and SHALL use the https scheme. The maximum length of this field is 256 ASCII characters.
>
> **ImageDigestType field**
>
> The ImageDigestTypeField SHALL contain the algorithm used to compute the [ImageDigest](#_bookmark1690) field.
>

For example, a value of 1 would match the sha- 256 identifier, which maps to the SHA-256 digest algorithm per Section 6.2 of [FIPS 180-4](#_bookmark22)
>
> It is RECOMMENDED that a digest algorithm be chosen that has a minimum digest length of 256 bits, such as sha-256 (ID 1 in the registry).
>
> **ImageDigest field**
>
> The ImageDigestField SHALL contain the digest of the entire payload of length [PayloadSize](#_bookmark1685) that fol­ lows the header. The digest SHALL be computed using the algorithm indicated in the [ImageDigest­](#_bookmark1689) [Type](#_bookmark1689) field. This digest SHOULD be used by OTA Providers to ensure they have obtained the entire image expected, and that the contents matches the expectations.

### Security considerations

> The OTA Software Image file format does not specify the mechanisms that an OTA Requestor should use to validate that a software image is valid for itself. Considerations relative to OTA Software

## Bulk Data Exchange Protocol (BDX)

### Overview

> Nodes need the ability to transfer "files" between nodes. For example, uploading sensor data or diagnostics data to another node or downloading software update images from a software update server both require such a protocol.
>
> This document defines a Bulk Data Exchange (BDX) protocol, where files are modeled as collections of bytes with some attached metadata. For the purposes of this protocol, files are opaque, and no attempt is made to specify their format. However, the protocol allows for extensible metadata so that higher-level applications can participate in the decision whether to proceed with a requested file transfer.
>
> The Bulk Data Exchange (BDX) protocol has some semantic elements influenced by the Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) [RFC 1350](#_bookmark42).
>
> One major difference is that TFTP is defined to run over UDP only, while Bulk Data Transfers can proceed over various reliable transports including both TCP and UDP, using the Message Reliability Protocol (see [Section 4.12, “Message Reliability Protocol (MRP)”](#message-reliability-protocol-mrp)). Therefore, BlockAck and BlockQuery fulfill the role of application-layer control flow and acknowledgement rather than providing a relia­ bility and retransmission mechanism. The availability of application-level flow control enables highly power-constrained nodes to pace transfers in a way that respects their power limitations.

### Terminology

#### BDX Sender

> The node that has bulk data to send to another node.

#### BDX Receiver

> The node that receives bulk data from a Sender.

#### BDX Initiator

> The node that initiates a bulk data transfer. The Initiator of a data transfer can either be the Sender (for "upload", which starts with a [SendInit](#_bookmark1700)) or the Receiver (for "download", which starts with a [ReceiveInit](#_bookmark1701)).

#### BDX Responder

> The node that responds to the initiator by either accepting or rejecting the proposed bulk data transfer and choosing parameters of the transfer compatible with those proposed by the Initiator. It can also either be the Sender (for "download", which is when the Responder receives a [ReceiveInit](#_bookmark1701)) or the Receiver (for "upload", which is when the Responder receives a [SendInit](#_bookmark1700)).

#### BDX Synchronous / Asynchronous Modes

> Bulk data transfers can operate in synchronous ("driven") or asynchronous mode. When operating in synchronous mode, one party (the Driver) is responsible for controlling the rate at which the transfer proceeds, and each message in the bulk data transfer protocol SHALL be acknowledged before the next message will be sent.
>
> In asynchronous mode, there is no driver and successive messages are freely sent without waiting for [BlockAck](#blockack-message) responses from the Receiver. In asynchronous mode, flow control is provided by the underlying transport (e.g. Matter over TCP).

#### BDX Driver

> The node (either Sender or Receiver) that controls the rate at which a synchronous data transfer proceeds by sending [Block](#block-message) or [BlockQuery](#blockquery-message) messages to advance the transfer. This facility allows for [intermittently connected devices](#intermittently-connected-device-icd) operating (e.g. due to battery constraints) to complete a bulk data transfer without requiring them to stay active continuously during the transfer. In every synchro­ nous bulk data transfer, exactly one device acts as Driver, and the transfer consists of a series of request/responses, each one initiated by the Driver.
>
> BDX utilizes features of the underlying message layer to provide reliability and at-most-once deliv­ ery semantics. If the transport fails to deliver the message within the specified parameters, the BDX session SHOULD be aborted. For synchronous transfers, if the Driver fails to receive the response to any given request that is not received within a particular application-determined time, it SHOULD abort the session.

#### BDX Follower

> The node (either Sender or Receiver) that "follows" the driver in the protocol flow. The protocol defines the followers as devices that can never be sleepy. Follower either receives a [BlockQuery](#blockquery-message) to send the data upon request from the driver or receives a new [Block](#block-message) message and acknowledges it with a [BlockAck](#blockack-message) message (in synchronous mode).

#### BDX Session

> A bulk data transfer Session is a series of messages passed between a Sender and Receiver that begins with the Initiator starting the transfer negotiation, and ends with a [BlockAckEOF](#blockackeof-message) from the Receiver which indicates receipt of all transmitted data and ends the session. All messages in a ses­ sion SHALL be sent within the scope of a single [Exchange](#message-exchanges-1). Only one bulk data transfer session can be in progress at any time during a [Exchange](#message-exchanges-1).

### Protocol Opcodes and Status Report Values

#### BDX Protocol Messages

> Each message in the BDX protocol is mapped to a unique [Protocol Opcode](#protocol-opcode-8-bits), namespaced under the
>
> [PROTOCOL_ID_BDX](#_bookmark251) [Protocol ID](#protocol-id-16-bits):

- [Vendor ID](#protocol-vendor-id-16-bits) = 0x0000 (Matter Common)

- [Protocol ID](#protocol-id-16-bits) = [PROTOCOL_ID_BDX](#_bookmark251)

> *Table 88. BDX Protocol Opcodes*

[TABLE]

#### BDX Status Codes

> The list of status codes used in [StatusReport](#appendix-d-status-report-messages) messages to signify a reason for failing or rejecting a transfer is provided in [Table 89, “BDX Status reports”](#_bookmark1697). For StatusReport messages, the protocol needs to be defined as the BDX protocol, i.e. StatusReport(GeneralCode: FAILURE, ProtocolId: {Ven­ dorID=0x0000, ProtocolId=[BDX](#_bookmark251)}, ProtocolCode: \<value\>).
>
> *Table 89. BDX Status reports*

[TABLE]

[TABLE]

> The following [StatusReport](#appendix-d-status-report-messages) message ProtocolCode values MAY occur at any time in response to any BDX message:

- *UNEXPECTED_MESSAGE*: When a peer receives a well-formed message that was contextually inappropriate for the current state of the transfer. For example, receiving a Block message before a SendAccept message, or other logical inconsistencies.

- *BAD_MESSAGE_CONTENTS*: When a peer receives a malformed protocol message.

- *TRANSFER_FAILED_UNKNOWN_ERROR*: Other error occurred, such as perhaps an input/output error occurring at either peer.

- *UNKNOWN*: Internal error beyond the usual error handling.

> If any such StatusReport message is received, or any other unexpected StatusReport is received, the receiving peer SHALL terminate its processing of the transfer and invalidate the exchange.

### Security and Transport Constraints

> In order to maintain data-in-transit confidentiality, and ensure authenticated message flows, the BDX protocol SHALL only be executed over [PASE](#passcode-authenticated-session-establishment-pase) or [CASE](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case) encrypted session. This is enforced by the fact that the only messages allowed to be transmitted without message security are the actual PASE and CASE session establishment messages.
>
> The BDX protocol MAY be carried over any supported Matter messaging transport, such as BTP, TCP or MRP, as long as the messages appear in a PASE or CASE session.
>
> Furthermore, the BDX protocol relies on transport-level reliability. Therefore, BDX SHALL always be used over reliable transports. For example, usage with Matter messaging over UDP without MRP reliability, that is, without using the [R Flag](#_bookmark242) in the [Exchange Flags](#exchange-flags-8-bits), would prevent the necessary reli­ ability.

### Transfer Management Messages

1.  SendInit **and** ReceiveInit **Messages**

> A SendInit message is sent by an Initiator to propose a BDX Transfer session where the Initiator wants to be a Sender and deliver information to another node.
>
> A ReceiveInit message is sent by an Initiator to propose a BDX Transfer session where the Initiator wants to be a Receiver and obtain information from another node.
>
> Any BDX transfer exchange begins with one of these two messages.
>
> Both SendInit and ReceiveInit initiate a negotiation for a number of parameters:

- the Initiator (sender of the message) proposes the transfer parameters and the block size;

- the Responder (receiver of the message) responds with a set of parameters compatible with the Initiator’s proposal, according to the Responder’s subset of capabilities in common with the Ini­ tiator.

> The Responder SHALL indicate all the supported modes of operation applicable to the session by replying, upon success, with SendAccept (in response to SendInit) or ReceiveAccept (in response to ReceiveInit).
>
> The parameters in the SendAccept/ReceiveAccept message MUST be used in the transfer. If those parameters are unacceptable to the Initiator, it MUST abort the transfer with an appropriate error per [Table 89, “BDX Status reports”](#_bookmark1697).
>
> Possible replies for SendInit (See [Section 11.22.7, “Synchronous Transfers Message Flows”](#synchronous-transfers-message-flows) for exam­ ples):

- Success: SendAccept, if the transfer is accepted by the Responder

- Failure: StatusReport(GeneralCode: FAILURE, ProtocolId: BDX, ProtocolCode: \<error-specific\>), if the transfer is rejected by the Responder, or anything that prevents the Responder from being able to proceed with the transfer as requested.

&nbsp;

- *FILE_DESIGNATOR_UNKNOWN*: The [file designator](#_bookmark1712) field was present and contained a file designator not supported by the responder.

- *START_OFFSET_NOT_SUPPORTED*: The [start offset](#_bookmark1709) field contained an invalid start offset, or presence of start offset indicated by [RC\[STARTOFS\]](#_bookmark1706) is not supported by the responder.

- *LENGTH_TOO_LARGE*: The [definite length](#_bookmark1710) field was present, but too large for the responder.

- *LENGTH_TOO_SHORT*: The [definite length](#_bookmark1710) field was present, but contextually too short based on the responder’s knowledge of expected size.

- *LENGTH_REQUIRED*: The responder can only support the proposed transfer if the [definite](#_bookmark1710) [length](#_bookmark1710) field is provided.

- *TRANSFER_METHOD_NOT_SUPPORTED*: The responder does not support the proposed transfer control method.

- *RESPONDER_BUSY*: The responder is too busy to process another transfer. An initiator

> SHOULD wait at least 60 seconds before attempting to initiate a new SendInit with this responder.
>
> Possible replies for ReceiveInit (See [Section 11.22.7, “Synchronous Transfers Message Flows”](#synchronous-transfers-message-flows) for examples):

- Success: ReceiveAccept, if the transfer is accepted by the Responder

- Failure: StatusReport(GeneralCode: FAILURE, ProtocolId: [PROTOCOL_ID_BDX](#_bookmark251), ProtocolCode:

> \<error-specific\>), if the transfer is rejected by the Responder, or anything that prevents the
>
> Responder from being able to proceed with the transfer as requested:

- *FILE_DESIGNATOR_UNKNOWN*: The [file designator](#_bookmark1712) field was present and contained a file designator not found or supported by the responder.

- *START_OFFSET_NOT_SUPPORTED*: The [start offset](#_bookmark1709) field contained an invalid start offset, or presence of start offset indicated by [RC\[STARTOFS\]](#_bookmark1706) is not supported by the responder.

- *LENGTH_TOO_LARGE*: The [definite length](#_bookmark1710) field was present, but too large for the responder.

- *LENGTH_REQUIRED*: The responder can only support the proposed transfer if the [definite](#_bookmark1710) [length](#_bookmark1710) field is provided.

- *TRANSFER_METHOD_NOT_SUPPORTED*: The responder does not support the proposed transfer control method.

- *RESPONDER_BUSY*: The responder is too busy to process another transfer. An initiator SHOULD wait at least 60 seconds before attempting to initiate a new ReceiveInit with this responder.

[TABLE]

[TABLE]

> The following subsections describe the fields composing the SendInit and \`ReceiveInit messages.
>
> **Proposed Transfer Control (**PTC**)**
>
> The Proposed Transfer Control (PTC) field specifies, as subfields, the highest version of the protocol and the transfer modes supported by the Initiator of the transfer. All PTC subfields are Initiator-pro­ posed. It is up to the Responder to decide what version and modes it will use. The first version, as of Matter specification 1.0 is BDX Version 0.
>
> At least one of the PTC\[RECEIVER_DRIVE\] or PTC\[SENDER_DRIVE\] field bits SHALL be set in order for the Responder to set the final transfer control. If neither PTC\[RECEIVER_DRIVE\] or PTC\[SENDER_DRIVE\] is set, the transfer SHALL be rejected by the Responder.
>
> The PTC\[ASYNC\] bit is an optimization of the transfer and is subject to negotiation with the Respon­ der. In general if the Initiator proposes an ASYNC transfer, it SHOULD also be prepared to accept a synchronous transfer, and SHOULD at least list one of PTC\[RECEIVER_DRIVE\] or PTC\[SENDER_DRIVE\] in the request.
>
> Multiple transfer modes can be specified, which signifies that the Initiator can support any of those transfer modes. For example, if PTC\[ASYNC\], PTC\[RECEIVER_DRIVE\] and PTC\[SENDER_DRIVE\] bits are set on a SendInit, it indicates that the Initiator supports 3 distinct transfer modes: synchronous Sender drive, synchronous Receiver drive and asynchronous (drive is implied). Only one transfer mode SHALL be used in the actual transfer. The Responder SHALL choose which one to use. If the Responder supports both Sender and Receiver drive, it SHOULD prefer to use Sender drive to retain the request/response semantics.
>
> *Table 91. SendInit/ReceiveInit Proposed Transfer Control (*PTC*) field structure*

[TABLE]

> The fields for PTC are:

#### SendInit/ReceiveInit PTC\[VERSION\]: proposed protocol version

- Width: 4 bits

- Values: 0x00-0x0F proposed protocol version

> **SendInit/ReceiveInit** PTC\[SENDER_DRIVE\]**: sender drive supported**

- Width: 1 bit

- Values:

  - 0 if Sender drive is not supported

  - 1 if Sender drive is supported by Initiator

> **SendInit/ReceiveInit** PTC\[RECEIVER_DRIVE\]**: receiver drive supported**

- Width: 1 bit

- Values:

  - 0 if Receiver drive is not supported

  - 1 if Receiver drive is supported by Initiator

#### SendInit/ReceiveInit PTC\[ASYNC\]: asynchronous mode supported

- Width: 1 bit

- Values:

  - 0 if asynchronous mode is not supported

  - 1 if asynchronous mode is supported by Initiator

  - NOTE: Synchronous mode is always implicitly supported.

> **Range Control (**RC**)**
>
> The Range Control (RC) field specifies parameters related to offset and length of the transfer:

- whether the transfer has a definite length (DEFLEN);

- whether an offset is present (STARTOFS);

- the width of the length and offset fields (WIDERANGE).

> *Table 92. SendInit/ReceiveInit Range Control (*RC*) field structure*

[TABLE]

> The fields for RC are:

#### SendInit/ReceiveInit RC\[DEFLEN\]: definite length present

- Width: 1 bit

  - Values:

    - 0 if no length is present (indefinite length)

    - 1 if a definite length is present (see [DEFLEN](#_bookmark1710) field)

> **SendInit/ReceiveInit** RC\[STARTOFS\]**: start offset present**

- Width: 1 bit

  - Values:

    - 0 if a start offset is not present

    - 1 if a start offset is present

#### SendInit/ReceiveInit RC\[WIDERANGE\]: wide (64-bit) range enable for values

- Width: 1 bit

  - Values:

    - 0 to indicate that offset ([STARTFOFS](#_bookmark1709)) and length ([DEFLEN](#_bookmark1710)) are 4 octets (32-bit) little-endian unsigned quantities.

    - 1 to indicate that offset ([STARTFOFS](#_bookmark1709)) and length ([DEFLEN](#_bookmark1710)) are 8 octets (64-bit) little-endian unsigned quantities.

> **Proposed Max Block Size (**PMBS**)**
>
> The Proposed Max Block Size (PMBS) field specifies the maximum data size (in bytes) of the block that the Initiator supports, exclusive of block header fields, such as a block counter.
>
> **Start Offset (**STARTOFS**)**
>
> The Start Offset (STARTOFS) field is an optional 32-bit/64-bit length that specifies the offset in bytes from start of the file from which the Sender would start the transfer. This allows large file transfers to be segmented into multiple bulk transfer sessions. The RC\[STARTOFS\] bit indicates whether this start offset is present in the message. The RC\[WIDERANGE\] bit defines the size of start offset quantity (32-bit or 64-bit). Receivers are not required to accept non-zero start offset transfers. Devices SHOULD make every attempt to support non-zero start offset. If a Responder cannot accept a given start offset, it MUST reject the SendInit with a StatusReport(GeneralCode: FAILURE, ProtocolId: [BDX](#_bookmark251), ProtocolCode: START_OFFSET_NOT_SUPPORTED). See [Table 89, “BDX Status reports”](#_bookmark1697).
>
> **Length (**DEFLEN**)**
>
> The optional length (DEFLEN) field specifies a predetermined definite length for the transfer. For a SendInit message, this field defines the number of bytes the Sender commits to sending to the Receiver. For a ReceiveInit message, this field defines the maximum number of bytes that the Receiver wishes to receive from the Sender. The SendAccept or ReceiveAccept response will then con­ tain the expected length for the transfer. A Receiver receiving a premature BlockEOF would have to consider the transfer failed. A length of 0 or a missing length field signifies an indefinite length. The
>
> [RC(DEFLEN)](#sendinitreceiveinit-rcdeflen-definite-length-present) bit indicates the presence of this field. The [RC\[WIDERANGE\]](#sendinitreceiveinit-rcwiderange-wide-64-bit-range-enable-for-values) bit indicates the width of this field.
>
> **File Designator Length (**FDL**)**
>
> The File Designator Length (FDL) field is a 16-bit unsigned little-endian field over 2 octets that speci­ fies the length of the upcoming file designator ([FD](#_bookmark1712)) field, which has variable length.
>
> **File Designator (**FD**)**
>
> The File Designator (FD) field is a variable-length identifier chosen by the Initiator to identify the payload to be transferred. In some applications, this identifier will need to be negotiated in advance, so that the Responder will know how to handle the file designator. In other applications, the file designator and optional metadata will be sufficient for the Responder to determine whether to accept the file transfer and how to handle the data, allowing the transfer to proceed without any additional message exchanges.
>
> The length of this field in bytes is provided by the previous File Designator Length ([FDL](#_bookmark1711)) field.
>
> **Metadata (**MDATA**)**
>
> The Metadata (MDATA) field is an optional field, and allows the Initiator to send additional applica­ tion-specific information about the file to be transferred. The contents of this field are not specified here; applications can use it to avoid needing a separate round-trip negotiation of the file designa­ tor, as described above. The TLV metadata consumes the rest of the payload for the SendInit
>
> /ReceiveInit message, after all previous fields.

#### SendAccept Message

> A SendAccept message is sent by the Responder as a response to SendInit in order to accept a BDX Transfer session where the Initiator wants to be a Sender and deliver information (upload) to the Responder. The final transfer parameters used are decided by the Responder, given the Initiator proposals in the SendInit message.
>
> Responds to (See [Section 11.22.7, “Synchronous Transfers Message Flows”](#synchronous-transfers-message-flows) for examples):

- SendInit - to accept the proposed transfer.

> Possible replies (See [Section 11.22.7, “Synchronous Transfers Message Flows”](#synchronous-transfers-message-flows) for examples):

- Block - if the Initiator accepts the parameters from the SendAccept message, and the transfer method is Sender drive.

- StatusReport - If there was another error the Initiator encountered.

> Possible follow-ups (See [Section 11.22.7, “Synchronous Transfers Message Flows”](#synchronous-transfers-message-flows) for examples):

- BlockQuery - if the proposed method is Receiver drive. If the Initiator does not accept the para­ meters, it SHOULD ignore this and send a StatusReport(GeneralCode: FAILURE, ProtocolId: [BDX](#_bookmark251), ProtocolCode: TRANSFER_METHOD_NOT_SUPPORTED) to end the transfer.

#### ReceiveAccept Message

> A ReceiveAccept message is sent by the Responder as a response to ReceiveInit in order to accept a BDX Transfer session where the Initiator wants to be a Receiver and receive information (down­ load) from the Responder. The final transfer parameters used are decided by the Responder, given the Initiator proposals in the ReceiveInit message.
>
> Responds to (See [Section 11.22.7, “Synchronous Transfers Message Flows”](#synchronous-transfers-message-flows) for examples):

- ReceiveInit - to accept the proposed transfer.

> Possible replies (See Message Flows for examples):

- BlockQuery - if the Initiator accepts the parameters from the ReceiveAccept message, and the transfer method is Receiver drive.

- StatusReport - If there was another error the Initiator encountered.

> Possible follow-ups (See [Section 11.22.7, “Synchronous Transfers Message Flows”](#synchronous-transfers-message-flows) for examples):

- Block - if the proposed method is Sender drive. If the Initiator does not accept the parameters, it SHOULD ignore this and send a StatusReport(GeneralCode: FAILURE, ProtocolId: [BDX](#_bookmark251), Protocol­ Code: TRANSFER_METHOD_NOT_SUPPORTED) to end the transfer.

#### SendAccept and ReceiveAccept message fields

> The format of the SendAccept message is enumerated in [Table 93, “SendAccept message fields”](#_bookmark1715).
>
> The format of the ReceiveAccept message is enumerated in [Table 94, “ReceiveAccept message](#_bookmark1716) [fields”](#_bookmark1716).
>
> Since the meaning of many fields overlap in these messages, they are described only once following the ReceiveAccept message fields.
>
> *Table 93. SendAccept message fields*

[TABLE]

> *Table 94. ReceiveAccept message fields*

[TABLE]

> The following subsections describe the fields composing the SendAccept and ReceiveAccept mes­ sages.
>
> **Transfer control (**TC**)**
>
> The Transfer Control (TC) field specifies, as subfields, the transfer mode and protocol version.
>
> For the transfer mode (TC\[SENDER_DRIVE\], TC\[RECEIVER_DRIVE\]), exactly one mode SHALL be chosen for this transfer, which MUST be one of the original proposed transfer methods sent by the Initia­ tor.
>
> The version SHALL be the newest version that is supported by the Responder and is not newer than the proposed version sent by the Initiator. If the Responder cannot support a version equal or older to the [proposed version](#sendinitreceiveinit-ptcversion-proposed-protocol-version), the Responder MUST send a StatusReport(GeneralCode: FAILURE, Proto­ colId: [BDX](#_bookmark251)\_, ProtocolCode: VERSION_NOT_SUPPORTED) to end the transfer.
>
> The Responder MAY reject a proposed asynchronous transfer ([PTC\[ASYNC\]](#sendinitreceiveinit-ptcasync-asynchronous-mode-supported) = 1) by sending a Status­ Report(GeneralCode: FAILURE, ProtocolId: [BDX](#_bookmark251), ProtocolCode: TRANSFER_METHOD_NOT_SUPPORTED) to end the transfer. If the Initiator proposed both the PTC\[RECEIVER_DRIVE\] and PTC\[SENDER_DRIVE\], the Responder SHALL select exactly one of those options. In that case, in order to retain the request/response semantics, the Responder MUST default to TC\[SENDER_DRIVE\].

> *Table 95. SendAccept/ReceiveAccept Transfer Control (*TC*) field structure*

[TABLE]

> The fields for TC are:
>
> **SendAccept/ReceiveAccept** TC\[VERSION\]**: protocol version**

- Width: 4 bits

- Values: 0x00-0x0F accepted protocol version

> **SendAccept/SendAccept** TC\[SENDER_DRIVE\]**: sender drive enabled**

- Width: 1 bit

- Values:

  - 0 if Sender drive was not chosen

  - 1 if Sender drive was chosen (if this is set, TC\[RECEIVER_DRIVE\] MUST be 0)

> **SendAccept/ReceiveAccept** TC\[RECEIVER_DRIVE\]**: receiver drive enabled**

- Width: 1 bit

- Values:

  - 0 if Receiver drive was not chosen

  - 1 if Receiver drive was chosen (if this is set, TC\[SENDER_DRIVE\] MUST be 0)

#### SendAccept/ReceiveAccept TC\[ASYNC\]: asynchronous mode enabled

- Width: 1 bit

- Values:

  - 0 if synchronous mode was chosen for the transfer.

  - 1 if asynchronous mode was chosen for the transfer.

  - NOTE: Synchronous mode is always implicitly supported.

> **ReceiveAccept Range Control (**RC**)**
>
> **NOTE** This field is only present in ReceiveAccept messages.
>
> The Range Control (RC) field specifies parameters related to offset and length of the transfer:

- whether the transfer has a definite length (DEFLEN);

- the width of the length and offset fields (WIDERANGE).

> *Table 96. ReceiveAccept Range Control (*RC*) field structure*

[TABLE]

> The fields for RC are:
>
> **ReceiveAccept** RC\[DEFLEN\]**: definite length present**

- Width: 1 bit

  - Values:

    - 0 if no length is present (indefinite length)

    - 1 if a definite length is present (see [LEN](#_bookmark1719) field)

#### ReceiveAccept RC\[WIDERANGE\]: wide (64-bit) range enable for values

- Width: 1 bit

  - Values:

    - 0 to indicate that length [LEN](#_bookmark1719) is a 4 octets (32-bit) little-endian unsigned quantity.

    - 1 to indicate that length [LEN](#_bookmark1719) is a 8 octets (64-bit) little-endian unsigned quantity.

> **Max Block Size (**MBS**)**
>
> The Max Block Size (MBS) field specifies the maximum size, in bytes, of each block for this transfer. The maximum whole block payload size will be the sum of the Max Block Size and the size of the block parameters (such as the block counter). This value MUST be less than or equal to the [pro­](#_bookmark1708) [posed max block size (PMBS)](#_bookmark1708).
>
> **Length (**LEN**)**
>
> **NOTE** This field is only present in ReceiveAccept messages, and only if RC\[DEFLEN\] = 1.
>
> The Length (LEN) field specifies the length of the transfer. If the Initiator indicated a definite length, this length SHALL either be:

- equal to the proposed definite length, if the remaining data in the file beyond the Start Offset (STARTOFS) is larger or equal to the proposed length;

- smaller than the proposed definite length, if the remaining data in the file beyond the Start Off­ set (STARTOFS) is smaller than the proposed length.

> If this field is present, and the Initiator indicated an indefinite length (i.e. [RC\[DEFLEN\] = 0](#sendinitreceiveinit-rcdeflen-definite-length-present) in ReceiveInit), this Length field SHALL be equal to the size of the file remaining (if known), or 0, for indefinite. The absence of the Length (LEN) field implies indefinite length.
>
> **Metadata (**MDATA**)**
>
> The Metadata (MDATA) field is optional and allows the Responder to provide application-specific metadata about the transfer in [TLV format](#appendix-a-tag-length-value-tlv-encoding-format). The TLV metadata consumes the rest of the payload for the SendAccept/ReceiveAccept message, after all previous fields.

### Data Transfer Messages

#### Block Ordering Rules

> The following behavior applies to all messages containing a Block Counter field.
>
> Queries (BlockQuery message) MUST be made in ascending and sequential Block Counter order. If the arriving Block Counter at the recipient is not exactly equal to the previous \`BlockQuery’s Block Counter, plus 1 (i.e. next block is being directly asked), a block counter SHALL be considered out-of- order by the recipient.
>
> Blocks (Block, BlockEOF message) MUST be sent in ascending and sequential Block Counter order. If the arriving Block Counter at the recipient is not exactly equal to current expected Block Counter, the block counter SHALL be considered out-of-order by the recipient.
>
> Block acknowledgements (BlockAck, BlockAckEOF messages) MUST be sent with the same Block Counter as the previously received Block/BlockEOF, since they convey a direct acknowledgement. If the arriving Block Counter at the recipient is not exactly equal to the last sent Block Counter, the Block Counter SHALL be considered out-of-order by the recipient.
>
> On any out-of-order block counter condition described above, the recipient of the out-of-order mes­ sage MUST send a StatusReport(GeneralCode: FAILURE, ProtocolId: [BDX](#_bookmark251), ProtocolCode: BAD_BLOCK\_­ COUNTER) and abort the transfer. On receiving a StatusReport(GeneralCode: FAILURE, ProtocolId: [BDX](#_bookmark251), ProtocolCode: BAD_BLOCK_COUNTER), the recipient MUST abort the transfer.
>
> Since Block Counter fields are always 32-bit unsigned integer values, but file sizes may be specified over 64-bit lengths to support very large transfers, the ordering for a "next block counter" SHALL use modulo 2^32 integer arithmetic. Therefore, if the last Block Counter was 0xFFFF_FFFF, the next expected Block Counter would be 0x0000_0000.

#### NOTE

> Since the data length of blocks does not need to exactly match the Max Block Size in Block/BlockEOF messages, it is application-dependent whether Block Counters can be used to statelessly track the offset within a span of initiated transfer. That is, the relationship: current_offset = start_offset + (max_block_size \* block_counter) is true **only** if it is contextually known that this usage applies for a given transfer application. This relationship, is MUST NOT be assumed, since it may not apply, such as when variable-sized blocks are being sent to optimize a given data transfer flow.

#### BlockQuery Message

> The BlockQuery message is sent by the driving Receiver to the follower to request the next block of data. This message implies a BlockAck of the previous block if no BlockAck was explicitly sent. The block counter SHOULD start at 0 at the start of the transfer, and increment by one for each subse­ quent block.
>
> In asynchronous transfers, no BlockQuery messages are sent. The fields of the BlockQuery message are:
>
> *Table 97. BlockQuery message fields*

[TABLE]

#### BlockQueryWithSkip Message

> The BlockQueryWithSkip message MAY be sent by a driving Receiver to the follower to request the next block of data, after skipping an amount forward within the stream. This message implies a BlockAck of the previous block if no BlockAck was explicitly sent.
>
> This message is semantically equivalent to a BlockQuery, but with the following additions:

- Before the next Block is sent by the Sender, the cursor within the underlying data transferred by the Sender SHALL be advanced by BytesToSkip bytes.

- If, after skipping BytesToSkip bytes, the cursor reaches the end of the file, or beyond, then the next message from the Sender SHALL be a BlockEOF with empty contents. In other words, there SHALL be no error indicated when receiving a request to skip past the end of the transferable data.

- The amount of BytesToSkip MAY be a size that does not match the current transfer’s maximum block size.

> This message enables seeking forward in BDX transfers without requiring the termination of a transfer followed by the re-opening of a new one with a different [STARTOFS](#_bookmark1709) field specified.
>
> In asynchronous transfers, no BlockQueryWithSkip messages are sent. The fields of the BlockQueryWithSkip message are:
>
> *Table 98. BlockQueryWithSkip message fields*

[TABLE]

#### Block Message

> The Block message is the container for the actual bulk transfer data.
>
> Blocks MUST be sent ascending and sequential block counter order (see [Section 11.22.6.1, “Block](#block-ordering-rules) [Ordering Rules”](#block-ordering-rules)). Block data payload length does not need to exactly match the Max Block Size for the transfer.
>
> The fields of the Block message are:
>
> *Table 99. Block message fields*

[TABLE]

#### BlockEOF Message

> The BlockEOF message represents the final block in a data transfer.
>
> Note that, unlike a Block, BlockEOF MAY have a data length of zero. If the entire transfer fits within the negotiated block size, the BlockEOF SHALL be the one and only message sent in the exchange and no Block messages will be sent. In that trivial case, the Block Counter would be 0 in the Block­ EOF.
>
> On receipt of this message, the recipient SHALL verify that the pre-negotiated file size was trans­ ferred, if a definite size had been given. If the Receiver finds a discrepancy between the pre-negoti­ ated size of the file and the amount of data that the Sender has sent, then it MAY consider the trans­ fer failed. In that case, the Receiver MAY respond with a StatusReport(GeneralCode: FAILURE, Proto­ colId: [BDX](#_bookmark251), ProtocolCode: LENGTH_MISMATCH) message.
>
> Blocks MUST be sent ascending and sequential block counter order (see [Section 11.22.6.1, “Block](#block-ordering-rules) [Ordering Rules”](#block-ordering-rules)). Block data payload length does not need to exactly match the Max Block Size for the transfer.
>
> *Table 100. BlockEOF message fields*

[TABLE]

[TABLE]

#### BlockAck Message

> The BlockAck message is an application-level acknowledgement that a Block was received, and not necessarily that the Block’s data was stored.
>
> If the Sender is driving in a synchronous transfer, the Receiver MUST send a BlockAck in response to each block of data received. If the Receiver is driving in a synchronous transfer, the Receiver MAY send a BlockAck after receipt of a Block, and before its next BlockQuery. For example, the Receiver SHOULD send a BlockAck if it knows it will be going to sleep for some time before the next Block­ Query, so that the Sender can free resources associated with the last block.
>
> In asynchronous transfers, no BlockAck messages are sent.
>
> The Block Counter in a BlockAck MUST correspond to the Block Counter which was embedded in the
>
> Block being acknowledged (see [Section 11.22.6.1, “Block Ordering Rules”](#block-ordering-rules)).
>
> *Table 101. BlockAck message fields*

[TABLE]

#### BlockAckEOF Message

> The BlockAckEOF message is sent in response to BlockEOF to indicate that the Receiver has received all data.
>
> This message MUST be sent in both synchronous and asynchronous transfers. This signals the end of the ongoing bulk data transfer session and a successful transfer of the file. The table below enu­ merates the contents of the message
>
> The Block Counter in a BlockAckEOF MUST correspond to the Block Counter which was embedded in the BlockEOF being acknowledged (see [Section 11.22.6.1, “Block Ordering Rules”](#block-ordering-rules)).

> In the [following flow](#_bookmark1729), the Initiator wants to continue downloading (receiving) a file after the first 200 bytes were received in a previous transfer. The entire remaining contents is desired until the end of the file. Therefore, the proposed start offset (STARTOFS) is set to the offset of the first byte desired in the first block transferred. The proposed length (PLEN) is set to 0 (or omitted) to announce desire to receive as much as is available from the Sender.
>
> During negotiation, the length (LEN) field of ReceiveAccept is set to the known remaining file size by the Sender. This could have also been omitted in case the Sender could not or would not state the maximal amount of data to read. Observe that block numbering begins at 0 for every transfer, even if the start offset is not 0. Block indices are always 0-based for every transfer.

## Distributed Compliance Ledger

### Scope & Purpose

> The CSA’s DCL (Distributed Compliance Ledger) is a distributed store of information used for track­ ing certification status and Vendor maintained information such as, but not limited to, product name, product description, and firmware URL. This information is cryptographically secured by digital signatures and is made available via CSA approved synchronized servers or nodes that are geographically distributed.
>
> The Policies, Procedure and Governance of DCL is maintained by Board approved committees that
>
> comprise Test Certification Oversight Committee (TCOC) and Security Advisory Group (SEC AG).
>
> [Distributed Compliance Ledger](https://github.com/zigbee-alliance/distributed-compliance-ledger) \[https://github.com/zigbee-alliance/distributed-compliance-ledger\] is an open- source project designed to:

- Act as a data store for device models' information and their compliance status.

- Act as a secure distribution point of device meta data as made available by vendors.

- Act as a secure distribution point of [Product Attestation Authorities certificates](#product-attestation-authority-paa-certificate).

- Act as a secure distribution point of [Operational Root CA Certificates (RCAC)](#trusted-root-ca-certificates).

> The DCL is owned and hosted by CSA members in a way that,

- Write access to Ledger is restricted

  - Vendors role can add new device models that belong to the VendorID that is associated with the public key of that vendor. VendorID is associated to the vendor public key during vendor account creation process.

  - Vendor role can update a subset of existing device model information, such as product name, product description, firmware and hardware info. Updates are only allowed if the device is associated with the same vendor account.

  - A TestHouse role can write the test status for each device to the Ledger.

  - A ZBCertificationCenter role can write the confirmation of the Compliance or revoke the Compliance status of a device model to the Ledger.

- Read access from DCL is public

  - Read DeviceModel info, including firmware and hardware versions from the DCL.

  - Read the Device compliance state from the Ledger.

  - Read the [Product Attestation Authorities certificates](#product-attestation-authority-paa-certificate).

  - Read the [Operational Root CA Certificates (RCAC)](#trusted-root-ca-certificates).

> The DCL is cryptographically secure, machine-readable, and distributed. More details about the Ledger can be found [here](https://github.com/zigbee-alliance/distributed-compliance-ledger/blob/master/docs/DCL-Overview.pdf) \[https://github.com/zigbee-alliance/distributed-compliance-ledger/blob/master/docs/ DCL-Overview.pdf\].
>
> While the [DCL repository](https://github.com/zigbee-alliance/distributed-compliance-ledger/) \[https://github.com/zigbee-alliance/distributed-compliance-ledger/\] functionality MAY contain more features which MAY evolve independently from those described in this section, this section SHALL be the normative source of truth for usage of the DCL within this specification.
>
> The DCL best practice guidelines are available in [Section 13.6.9, “Distributed Compliance Ledger”](#distributed-compliance-ledger-1).

#### VendorID

> This field SHALL indicate the [VendorID](#vendor-identifier-vendor-id-vid) associated with the PAA or PAI whose revocation informa­ tion is provided. For a non-vendor-scoped PAA, this SHALL be the VendorID associated with the organization operating the PAA. For vendor-scoped PAA and for PAIs, this field SHALL contain the VendorID as found in the CRLSignerCertificate (see [Section 6.2.2.2, “Encoding of Vendor ID and](#encoding-of-vendor-id-and-product-id-in-subject-and-issuer-fields) [Product ID in subject and issuer fields”](#encoding-of-vendor-id-and-product-id-in-subject-and-issuer-fields) for encoding).

#### ProductID

> This field is only required when a PAI is making the distribution point available. This field SHALL only be provided if the IsPAA field is false and if the CRLSignerCertificate field has a ProductID in its subject (see [Section 6.2.2.2, “Encoding of Vendor ID and Product ID in subject and issuer fields”](#encoding-of-vendor-id-and-product-id-in-subject-and-issuer-fields) for encoding).

#### IsPAA

> This field SHALL be set to true if the revocation information distribution point relates to a PAA, oth­ erwise it SHALL be set to false (i.e. it relates to a PAI, not a PAA)."

#### Label

> This field contains a label to disambiguate multiple revocation information partitions of a particu­ lar issuer. Uniqueness within the Device Attestation PKI Revocation Distribution Points schema SHALL be enforced against the tuple containing all of:

- VendorID

- Label

- IssuerSubjectKeyID

> Therefore, there MAY be multiple entries for the same VendorID and IssuerSubjectKeyID in case partitioning is done, which are disambiguated by the Label.
>
> Enforcement of uniqueness constraints SHALL be done by the Distributed Compliance Ledger’s block transaction processing and SHALL also be done by clients making use of the information from this schema.

#### CRLSignerDelegator

> This field SHALL be present and non-empty if all of the following are true:

- Certificate in CRLSignerCertificate field is not self-signed.

- IsPAA is false.

- CRLSignerCertificate is not a PAI.

> When present, this field SHALL contain the issuer certificate which signed the CRLSignerCertificate, encoded in X.509v3 PEM format.
>
> Additional constraints related to the value of this field are specified in [Section 11.23.9.6, “CRLSign­](#crlsignercertificate) [erCertificate”](#crlsignercertificate).

#### CRLSignerCertificate

> This field SHALL contain the issuer certificate who signed the revocation information that is pro­ vided in the distribution point entry, encoded in X.509v3 PEM format.
>
> If the RevocationType is 1 (X.509v3 CRL):

- The certificate’s subject public key SHALL be used to validate the signatureValue of the Certifi­ cateList object in the CRL (see [RFC 5280](#_bookmark54) sec 5.1.1.3). These checks SHALL be done by the client making use of the information, since they cannot be done by the Distributed Compliance Ledger implementation which cannot rely on out-of-ledger records or files.

- The certificate’s SubjectKeyIdentifier mandatory extension SHALL match the Authority Key Identifier found in the file at the DataUrl.

- The certificate SHALL be checked for correct chaining by the dynamic validation within the Dis­ tributed Compliance Ledger’s block transaction processing:

  - If the certificate is self-signed, it SHALL be considered as a PAA certificate, the IsPAA field SHALL be true, and the certificate SHALL be found in the list of approved PAA certificates currently in force in the Distributed Compliance Ledger using exact byte equality.

  - If the certificate is not self-signed and the IsPAA field is set to true, it SHALL be considered as a CRL signer certificate delegated by a PAA. The certificate format SHALL be as specified in [Section 11.23.9.6.1, “PAA-delegated CRLSignerCertificate format”](#_bookmark1769). The certificate SHALL be validated using the set of approved PAA certificates currently in force in the Distributed Compliance Ledger and the IssuerSubjectKeyID field SHALL match the SubjectKeyIdentifier extension value in the matching PAA. Commissioners SHALL verify that the PAA that issued the CRLSignerCertificate is the same PAA that issued the PAI being checked for revocation.

  - If the certificate is not self-signed and the IsPAA field is set to false, it SHALL be considered as a PAI certificate or a CRL signer certificate delegated by a PAI. The format of a CRL signer certificate delegated by a PAI SHALL be as specified in [Section 11.23.9.6.2, “PAI-delegated](#_bookmark1770) [CRLSignerCertificate format”](#_bookmark1770). If the CRL signer certificate is not a PAI certificate but is dele­

> gated by a PAI, then the PAI certificate SHALL be present in the CRLSignerDelegator field so that the full certificate chain can be verified. The certification path containing the certificate SHALL be validated using the set of approved PAA certificates currently in force in the Dis­ tributed Compliance Ledger as the trust store. Commissioners SHALL verify that either the CRLSignerCertificate or the CRLSignerDelegator is the same PAI that issued the DAC being checked for revocation.
>
> **PAA-delegated CRLSignerCertificate format**
>
> In case the CRLSignerCertificate is a delegate of a PAA for signing CRL for revoking PAI certificates, then the certificate SHALL follow the following constraints layered on top of the encoding specified by [RFC 5280](#_bookmark54) within the TBSCertificate structure:

1.  The version field SHALL be set to 2 to indicate v3 certificate.

2.  The signature field SHALL contain the identifier for signatureAlgorithm ecdsa-with-SHA256.

3.  The issuer field SHALL be a sequence of RelativeDistinguishedName s.

4.  The issuer field SHALL match the subject field of the parent PAA certificate.

5.  The subject field SHALL be a sequence of RelativeDistinguishedName s.

6.  A ProductID value SHALL NOT be present in either the subject or issuer fields.

7.  The algorithm field in subjectPublicKeyInfo field SHALL be the object identifier for prime256v1.

8.  The certificate SHALL carry the following Extensions:

    1.  Basic Constraint extension SHALL be marked critical and have the cA field set to FALSE.

    2.  Key Usage extension SHALL be marked critical.

        1.  The cRLSign bits SHALL be set in the KeyUsage bitstring

        2.  The digitalSignature bit MAY be set in the KeyUsage bitstring

        3.  Other bits SHALL NOT be set

    3.  Subject Key Identifier

9.  The certificate MAY also carry the following additional Extensions:

    1.  Extended Key Usage

    2.  Authority Key Identifier

    3.  Any other extension allowed in [RFC 5280](#_bookmark54) where inclusion does not violate size limitations. These extensions insofar not defined in this specification SHALL be ignored, but MAY be present to allow flexibility in CA operation.

#### IssuerSubjectKeyID

> This field SHALL uniquely identify the PAA or PAI for which this revocation distribution point is provided, via the certificate’s SubjectKeyIdentifier mandatory extension. This field is provided to assist queries without requiring additional certificate parsing. This field SHALL provide the subject key identifier as an even number of uppercase hexadecimal characters (\[0-9A-F\]), with no white­ space and no non-hexadecimal characters.
>
> For example, subject key ID A3:03:13:6D:54:A8:4B:E2:4C:48:87:B3:41:06:6D:C2:70:96:2F:99 (as it
>
> would appear in openssl x509 output, for human consumption) would be recorded as
>
> A303136D54A84BE24C4887B341066DC270962F99.
>
> When processing revocation information during the device [Device Attestation Procedure](#device-attestation-procedure), clients SHALL only use entries whose IssuerSubjectKeyID matches a candidate certificate’s Authority Key Identifier extension.

#### DataUrl

> This field SHALL indicate the URL where to obtain the information in the format indicated by the RevocationType field. The syntax of this field SHALL follow the syntax as specified in [RFC 1738](#_bookmark43). The maximum length of this field is 256 ASCII characters. All URLs SHALL use either the http or https scheme.
>
> For entries of RevocationType 1 ([RFC 5280](#_bookmark54) CRL):

- The content located at the DataUrl SHALL be a [RFC 5280](#_bookmark54) Certificate Revocation List document

> (see section 5 in the RFC) encoded in DER format.

- Note that conformance to the [RFC 5280](#_bookmark54) CRL profile requires at least the AuthorityKeyIdenti­ fier and CRLNumber extensions to be present in the document.

&nbsp;

- If multiple entries exist in the schema, which match in VendorID and IssuerSubjectKeyID, then:

  - All entries SHALL have a different Label.

  - All entries SHALL have a different DataUrl.

  - The content located at the DataURL SHALL have the Issuing Distribution Point critical CRL extension present (see [RFC 5280](#_bookmark54) section 5.2.5).

    - DCL software SHALL validate the uniqueness of Label and DataUrl of each entry.

    - Note that the content located at the DataURL will never be accessed or validated by DCL software which cannot rely on out-of-ledger records or files.

  - Based on the Issuing Distribution Point critical CRL extension (see [RFC 5280](#_bookmark54) section 5.2.5), the following validation SHALL be applied:

    - The distributionPoint field of the extension SHALL have a single GeneralName of type

> uniformResourceIdentifier.

- The uniformResourceIdentifier SHALL match exactly, byte-for-byte, the value found in the DataUrl field of this schema entry.

- If the value of the [CRLSignerCertificate](#crlsignercertificate) is a CRL signer certificate delegated by a PAA or delegated by a PAI, then the indirectCRL field of the extension SHALL be set to true. Oth­ erwise, the indirectCRL field of the extension SHALL be set to false.

#### DataFileSize

> This field, if present, SHALL indicate the total size in bytes of the file found at the DataUrl. This field SHALL be omitted if the RevocationType is 1, which refers to a type having built-in signatures.

#### DataDigest

> This field, if present, SHALL contain the digest of the entire contents of the associated file down­ loaded from the DataUrl field, encoded in base64 string representation. The digest SHALL have been computed using the algorithm specified in DataDigestType. This field SHALL be present if and only if the DataFileSize field is present.

#### DataDigestType

> This field, if present, SHALL indicate the type of digest used in the DataDigest field. This field SHALL be provided if and only if the DataDigest field is present.
>
> The value of this field SHALL be a supported numerical identifier value from the [IANA Named](https://www.iana.org/assignments/named-information/named-information.xhtml#hash-alg) [Information Hash Algorithm Registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/named-information/named-information.xhtml#hash-alg) \[[https://www.iana.org/assignments/named-information/named-informa](http://www.iana.org/assignments/named-information/named-informa)­ tion.xhtml#hash-alg\] established as part of [RFC 6920](#_bookmark64). For example, a value of 1 would match the sha- 256 identifier, which maps to the SHA-256 digest algorithm per Section 6.2 of [FIPS 180-4](#_bookmark22).
>
> The digest algorithm chosen SHALL have a minimum digest length of 256 bits, such as sha-256 (ID 1 in the registry).
>
> To increase interoperability, DataDigestType, if present, SHALL be within the list of \[1, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12\].

#### RevocationType

> This field SHALL identify the type of file found at the DataUrl for this entry. Values supported are:

- 0: Undefined. This value SHALL NOT appear

- 1: [RFC 5280](#_bookmark54) Certificate Revocation List (CRL)

- Other: reserved for future use.

## Joint Fabric Datastore Cluster

> The Joint Fabric Datastore Cluster is a cluster that provides a mechanism for the [Joint Fabric](#joint-fabric-1) Administrators to manage the set of Nodes, Groups, and Group membership among Nodes in the [Joint Fabric](#joint-fabric-1).
>
> When an Ecosystem Administrator Node is commissioned onto the [Joint Fabric](#joint-fabric-1), the Ecosystem Administrator Node has no knowledge of what Nodes and Groups are present, or what set-up infor­ mation related to the [Joint Fabric](#joint-fabric-1) is provided by the user. To address lack of knowledge, the Joint Fabric Datastore provides the information required for all Ecosystem Administrators to maintain a consistent view of the [Joint Fabric](#joint-fabric-1) including Nodes, Groups, settings and privileges.
>
> The Joint Fabric Datastore cluster server SHALL only be accessible on a Node which is acting as the Joint Fabric Anchor Administrator. When not acting as the Joint Fabric Anchor Administrator, the Joint Fabric Datastore cluster SHALL NOT be accessible.
>
> The Admin level of access to the Joint Fabric Datastore cluster server SHALL be limited to JF Adminis­ trator Nodes identified using the [Administrator CAT](#administrator-cat).
>
> **NOTE** Support for Joint Fabric Datastore cluster is provisional.

### Revision History

### Usage Requirements

> This section describes the required flows for Joint Fabric Administrators to perform common actions related to adding and removing Nodes to a Joint Fabric, and managing Groups and Group Membership on the Joint Fabric.
>
> Many flows performed by a Joint Fabric Administrator require commands to be sent to the Datas­ tore in order to keep the Datastore up-to-date with regard to Nodes and Groups on the Fabric. While a Joint Fabric Administrator SHALL update the Datastore with changes made to Nodes and Groups, it MAY complete these configuration and commissioning tasks when the Datastore is unreachable. If attempts to update the Datastore fail due to temporary conditions (reachability issues, BUSY response error, RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED error, etc.), the Commissioner SHALL periodically retry the attempted commands until successful.
>
> The RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED error MAY be used by the Datastore to indicate that a storage capacity limit of the Datastore has been reached and SHALL notify the user of this condition using propri­ etary means outside of this specification (ex. email, screen-based notification, etc.), and SHALL pro­ vide a means for the user to purge information pertaining to unused Nodes.

#### Adding a Node to the Joint Fabric

> During commissioning of a Node onto a Joint fabric, the Fabric Administrator performing the com­ missioning first populates the Datastore in order to ensure the new Node can be discovered by any client on the fabric for which the user has granted access. Specifically, before completing the com­ missioning process, the Commissioner SHALL invoke the [Add Pending Node Command](#addpendingnode-command) in order to add a node entry to the Datastore (which will be marked with “pending” status since commission­ ing of the device has not yet completed), and follow [Section 11.24.4.9, “Adding/Removing access](#addingremoving-access-privileges-for-a-controller) [privileges for a Controller”](#addingremoving-access-privileges-for-a-controller) to ensure access privileges are managed consistently across the Joint Fabric. After completion of commissioning and associated configuration, the Commissioner SHALL invoke the [Refresh Node Command](#refreshnode-command) in order to indicate completion of commissioning and to cause the Datastore to update the Node Information Entry with state read from the Node and mark the entry as "committed". By performing this work in two steps (first pending status, then committed status), the design can prevent error scenarios where a node is brought onto a fabric without
>
> appearing in the Datastore. Commissioning Flow - Datastore Impact

1.  Regular Flow: Commissioner obtains setup code, discovers device, completes PASE portion of commissioning.

2.  Datastore Step: Commissioner SHALL add a Node Information Entry to the Datastore (see [Add](#addpendingnode-command) [Pending Node Command](#addpendingnode-command)).

3.  Regular Flow: Commissioner finalizes commissioning via CASE.

> If the finalize commissioning step fails, the Commissioner removes the pending node from the Datastore (see [Remove Node Command](#removenode-command).
>
> If the finalize commissioning step succeeds, the Commissioner SHALL indicate completion by call­ ing the \<ref_RefreshNode,Refresh Node Command\>\>.

#### Removing a Node from the Joint Fabric

> When removing a Node from the [Joint Fabric](#joint-fabric-1) the following steps SHALL be followed:

1.  The [Joint Fabric](#joint-fabric-1) Administrator SHALL first remove access privileges (see [Section 11.24.4.9,](#addingremoving-access-privileges-for-a-controller) [“Adding/Removing access privileges for a Controller”](#addingremoving-access-privileges-for-a-controller)) for the Node.

2.  The Node Information Entry SHALL be removed from the Joint Fabric Datastore using the [Remove Node Command](#removenode-command).

#### Pending Data Cleanup

> The Datastore SHALL periodically review its data in a Pending and PendingDeletion state and attempt to reach the corresponding Node in order to apply these updates. Examples of configura­ tion that may be in such a state include:

1.  Node GroupKey additions and removals.

2.  Node Endpoint Group membership additions and removals.

3.  Node ACL additions, updates and removals for groups, including changes relating to CAT ver­ sion updates.

4.  Node Binding additions and removals for groups.

> See [Refresh Node Command](#refreshnode-command) for a detailed description of each step. An Administrator MAY invoke this command at any time to request that the Datastore perform this operation immediately for a given Node.
>
> When a new node entry is left in the pending state, a [Joint Fabric](#joint-fabric-1) Administrator may not be able to determine whether commissioning completed or failed. In this scenario, the [Joint Fabric](#joint-fabric-1) Adminis­ trator must continue to monitor and attempt maintenance duties upon the node until the node entry is removed by another [Joint Fabric](#joint-fabric-1) Administrator or by the user.

#### Adding a Node to a Group

> When adding a Node to a Group, the [Joint Fabric](#joint-fabric-1) Administrator SHALL use the [AddGroupIDToEnd­](#addgroupidtoendpointfornode-command) [pointForNode Command](#addgroupidtoendpointfornode-command) to update the Node with the KeySet and Group relationship required for the new Group membership.
>
> When the Group membership is intended for control of the Node, the [Joint Fabric](#joint-fabric-1) Administrator SHALL use the [AddACLToNode Command](#addacltonode-command) to update the Node with the appropriate ACL.
>
> When the Group membership is intended for control by the Node, the [Joint Fabric](#joint-fabric-1) Administrator SHALL use the [AddBindingToEndpointForNode Command](#addbindingtoendpointfornode-command) to update the Node with the appropriate Binding.

#### Removing a Node from a Group

> When the Group membership was used for control of the Node, the [Joint Fabric](#joint-fabric-1) Administrator SHALL use the [RemoveACLFromNode Command](#removeaclfromnode-command) to remove the ACL from the Node.
>
> When the Group membership was used for control by the Node, the [Joint Fabric](#joint-fabric-1) Administrator SHALL use the [RemoveBindingFromEndpointForNode Command](#removebindingfromendpointfornode-command) to remove the Binding from the Node.
>
> When removing a Node from a Group, the [Joint Fabric](#joint-fabric-1) Administrator SHALL use the [Remove­](#removegroupidfromendpointfornode-command) [GroupIDFromEndpointForNode Command](#removegroupidfromendpointfornode-command) to ensure the KeySet and Group relationship is removed from the Node and the Datastore reflects the new Group membership.
>
> For groups with access control considerations, the [Joint Fabric](#joint-fabric-1) Administrator SHALL use the [UpdateGroup Command](#updategroup-command) to update the GroupKeySetID and increment the GroupCATVersion. If the Node is a Controller, then the [Joint Fabric](#joint-fabric-1) Administrator SHALL also update the GroupCATVersion of the Group.

#### Making a Node a Group Controller (eg. Light Switch example)

> In this example, Node N’s Endpoint E (On/Off Light Switch) should control Group G with Group Key Set K:

1.  Make sure Node N is in Group G by calling [AddGroupIDToEndpointForNode Command](#addgroupidtoendpointfornode-command) with arguments N, E, and G.

2.  Add a binding to Endpoint E on Node N by calling [AddBindingToEndpointForNode Command](#addbindingtoendpointfornode-command) with arguments N, E, and the desired Binding.

#### Adding a Joint Fabric Administrator Node to a Fabric

> When a Node is a Joint Fabric Administrator, its Group membership does not need to be managed by the Datastore since it has the ability to monitor the Datastore and issue operational certs for its own Administrator Nodes at any time. As a result, rather than adding Joint Fabric Administrator Nodes to the regular NodeList attribute via the [AddPendingNode Command](#addpendingnode-command), these Nodes SHALL be added to the AdminList via the [AddAdmin Command](#addadmin-command).
>
> It’s important to explicitly track the vendor ID of an [Joint Fabric](#joint-fabric-1) Administrator so that the [Joint Fab­](#joint-fabric-1)
>
> [ric](#joint-fabric-1) Administrator controlling the Root Operational Cert for the fabric can sign intermediate certifi­ cates which can be used by an [Joint Fabric](#joint-fabric-1) Administrator to issue operational certificates.

#### Adding/Updating/Removing a Group

> When adding a group, a client must create the group information entry before adding membership associations between the Node and the Group.
>
> Adding a Group
>
> Add Group Key Set Entry (if new) using the [AddKeySet Command](#addkeyset-command), followed by Group Information Entry using the [AddGroup Command](#addgroup-command).
>
> Updating a Group
>
> Update the Group Key Set Entry (if changing) using the [UpdateKeySet Command](#updatekeyset-command). Update the Group Information Entry using the [UpdateGroup Command](#updategroup-command). KeySet and Group updates performed using these commands will cause the Datastore to attempt to update all Node members of the group with these changes. Any Node changes that do not complete (for example, if the Node is unreachable) will result in Pending status on the data in the Node Information Entry.
>
> Removing a Group
>
> Remove the Group Information Entry using the [UpdateGroup Command](#updategroup-command). This command will fail if the Group is in use (and not with PendingDelete Status) by any Nodes.
>
> Remove the Group Key Set Entry using the [RemoveKeySet Command](#removekeyset-command). This command will fail if this KeySet is in use by any Groups.

#### Adding/Removing access privileges for a Controller

> In order to ensure a consistent approach to access control by Administrators on a [Joint Fabric](#joint-fabric-1), [Joint](#joint-fabric-1) [Fabric](#joint-fabric-1) Administrators SHALL use groups in the Datastore for managing access to Nodes. One goal of this approach is to avoid creating ACL entries on Nodes which reference a single NodeID, which does not scale as the number of Controller NodeIDs increases. Instead, ACLs can reference the CAT tag of the group or the GroupID of the group, depending upon the type of access intended. Each group in the Datastore contains a CAT tag for use in unicast access to group members, and a KeySet for use in broadcast access to group members.
>
> In order to add a new access privilege to NodeA by ControllerB, the [Joint Fabric](#joint-fabric-1) Administrator SHALL identify a group to use for this grant (using [Section 11.24.7.4, “AddGroup Command”](#addgroup-command) to cre­ ate a new one if needed), and call [Section 11.24.7.15, “AddGroupIDToEndpointForNode Command”](#addgroupidtoendpointfornode-command) and [Section 11.24.7.19, “AddACLToNode Command”](#addacltonode-command) in order to configure NodeA to allow access by the group. Next, the Administrator SHALL provide a NOC to the controller containing the CAT tag specified for the given group.
>
> In order to remove an access privilege grant for ControllerB on NodeA, the [Joint Fabric](#joint-fabric-1) Administra­ tor SHALL revoke access to the group by ControllerB (see [Section 11.24.4.5, “Removing a Node from](#removing-a-node-from-a-group) [a Group”](#removing-a-node-from-a-group)) and in doing so, ensure that the CAT version for the Group Information Entry is incre­ mented.

#### RequestCommissioningApproval Command

> This command is sent by a client to request approval for a future CommissionNode call. This is required to be a separate step in order to provide the server time for interacting with a user before informing the client that the CommissionNode operation may be successful.
>
> If the command is not executed via a CASE session, the command SHALL fail with a status code of UNSUPPORTED_ACCESS.
>
> The server MAY request approval from the user, but it is not required.
>
> The server SHALL always return SUCCESS to a correctly formatted RequestCommissioningApproval command, and then generate a CommissioningRequestResult event associated with the command’s
>
> accessing fabric once the result is ready.
>
> Clients SHOULD avoid using the same RequestID. If the RequestID and client NodeID of a Request­ CommissioningApproval match a previously received RequestCommissioningApproval and the server has not returned an error or completed commissioning of a device for the prior request, then the server SHOULD return FAILURE.

#### RequestID

> This SHALL be set by the client to be used again in future interactions.

#### VendorID / ProductID fields

> These fields SHALL contain the VendorID and ProductID which match the values in the Device Attestation Certificate of the device that the client would like to have commissioned in the subse­ quent ReverseOpenCommissioningWindow command.

#### Label

> The Label field SHOULD be set to a user readable name for the device that the client would like to have commissioned in the subsequent ReverseOpenCommissioningWindow command. This may be an ecosystem defined label or user provided name.
>
> For example, in [FabricSynchronization](#supporteddevicecategorybitmap-type) between two ecosystems (E1 as initial commissioner and E2 as initial commissionee), the label here represents the node on E1 that will be commissioned by E2 in the reverse commissioning operation after E1 has initially commissioned E2. This enables E2 to provide the user with a label for the node on E1 prior to completing the reverse commissioning operation.

#### CommissionNode Command

> This command is sent by a client to request that the server begins commissioning a previously approved request.
>
> The server SHALL return FAILURE if the CommissionNode command is not sent from the same NodeID and on the same fabric as the RequestCommissioningApproval or if the provided RequestID to CommissionNode does not match the value provided to RequestCommissioningApproval.
>
> If the command is not executed via a CASE session, the command SHALL fail with a status code of
>
> UNSUPPORTED_ACCESS.
>
> Upon receipt, the server SHALL respond with ReverseOpenCommissioningWindow if Commission­ ingRequestResult was generated with StatusCode of SUCCESS for the matching RequestID field and NodeID of the client.
>
> The server SHALL return FAILURE if the CommissionNode command is received after the server has already responded to a client with ReverseOpenCommissioningWindow for a matching RequestID field and NodeID of the client unless the client has sent another RequestCommis­ sioningApproval and received an additional CommissioningRequestResult.
>
> The parameters for CommissionNode command are as follows:

| **ID** | **Name** | **Type** | **Constraint** | **Quality** | **Default** | **Confor­ mance** |

| 0 | **RequestID** | uint64 |  |  |  | M |
| 1 | **Response­ TimeoutSec­ onds** | uint16 | 30 to 120 |  | 30 | M |

#### RequestID Field

> This SHALL be set by the client to be the same value provided to RequestCommissioningApproval.

#### ResponseTimeoutSeconds Field

> Timeout in seconds that the client SHALL wait to receive a response before considering the responses invalid.

#### ReverseOpenCommissioningWindow Command

> When received within the timeout specified by ResponseTimeoutSeconds in the CommissionNode command, the client SHALL open a commissioning window on a node which matches the VendorID and ProductID provided in the associated RequestCommissioningApproval command.
>
> When commissioning this node, the server SHALL check that the VendorID and ProductID fields provided in the RequestCommissioningApproval command match the VendorID and ProductID attributes of the Basic Information Cluster which have already been verified during the [Device](#device-attestation-procedure) [Attestation Procedure](#device-attestation-procedure). If they do not match, the server SHALL NOT complete commissioning and SHOULD indicate an error to the user.

#### NOTE

> This is an alias onto the [Open Commissioning Window](#opencommissioningwindow-command) command within the Admin­ istrator Commissioning Cluster. Refer to the [Open Commissioning Window](#opencommissioningwindow-command) com­ mand for a description of the command behavior and parameters.

# Chapter 12. Multiple Fabrics

## Introduction

> The Multiple Fabric feature allows a Node to be commissioned to multiple separately-administered Fabrics. With this feature a current Administrator can (with user consent) allow the Commissioner for another fabric to commission that Node within its Fabric. The new Commissioner MUST have their own [Node Operational Certificate (NOC)](#node-operational-certificate-noc) issued by its Trusted Root Certificate Authority (TRCA). Once commissioning is completed and the Node is properly configured, Administrators on the newly joined Fabric have access to the Node and can perform all administrative tasks.
>
> A Fabric is anchored by its Trusted Root Certificate Authority (TRCA). A TRCA MAY delegate to one or more Intermediate Certificate Authorities (ICA) which issue [NOCs](#node-operational-certificate-noc). Multiple vendors or compa­ nies can use the same CA hierarchy in which case they will be governed under the same Trusted Root Certificate Authority.

## Joint Fabric

### Introduction

> When multiple vendors or companies use the same CA hierarchy, governed under the same Trusted Root Certificate Authority, they create a Joint Fabric using the [Joint Commissioning Method](#joint-commissioning-method-jcm) flow. This flow enables a set of one or more companies to use a single fabric anchored by the Trusted Root Certificate Authority (TRCA). In the context of JCM, the fabric that is anchored by this TRCA is known as the Anchor Fabric.
>
> **NOTE** Support for Joint Fabric is provisional.

### Node ID Generation

> Any newly-allocated Node ID SHALL:

- be greater than 0x0000_0000_0000_0000, but less than 0xFFFF_FFEF_FFFF_FFFF, representing a value within the Operational NodeID range (see [Table 4, “Node Identifier Allocations”](#_bookmark119));

- be checked to ensure its uniqueness in the [NodeList](#nodelist-attribute) attribute of the [Joint Fabric](#joint-fabric-1) Datastore The Node ID SHALL be regenerated if these constraints are not met.

> It is RECOMMENDED to use random allocation within the valid range to avoid having to regenerate the Node ID.

### Anchor ICAC requirements

> Anchor ICAC SHALL be the ICAC corresponding to the Anchor Administrator. Anchor ICAC SHALL contain the reserved org-unit-name attribute from the [Table 64, “Standard DN Object Identifiers”](#_bookmark624) with value jf-anchor-icac in its Subject DN. The Anchor CA SHALL NOT place the reserved org- unit-name attribute jf-anchor-icac value into any Node that is not the Anchor Administrator. The
>
> Anchor CA SHALL place the reserved org_unit-name attribute jf-anchor-icac value into the Anchor ICAC.

### Joint Fabric ACL Architecture

> A set of [CASE Authenticated Tags](#_bookmark647) defined to be used in the context of Joint Fabric. In combination with the Anchor ICAC, these CATs can provide a greater level of security.

#### Administrator CAT

> The Administrator CAT is meant to simplify management of the group of Administrator Nodes as opposed to managing a list of subject Node IDs. All devices participating in [Joint Fabric](#joint-fabric-1) SHALL con­ tain an ACL entry granting Administer privilege to CaseSubjectAdmin set to the Administrator CAT. During commissioning of any Node onto the [Joint Fabric](#joint-fabric-1) the CaseAdminSubject field SHALL be set to the Administrator CAT upon invoking the [AddNOC](#addnoc-command) command.
>
> Any Node advertising as a [Joint Fabric](#joint-fabric-1) Administrator SHALL contain the Administrator CAT in its NOC. A NOC containing the Administrator CAT MAY be issued by any [Joint Fabric](#joint-fabric-1) Administrator.
>
> Any client that discovers the Administrator Node with DNS-SD and connects to the Node via CASE SHALL check if the Administrator CAT is present in the NOC of the Node as part of the CASE hand­ shake. This SHALL be required in order to verify that the Node is authorized to act as an Adminis­ trator in the [Joint Fabric](#joint-fabric-1).
>
> If the Administrator CAT is already in use in a fabric that wants to participate in the [Joint Fabric](#joint-fabric-1) then its Administrator first needs to take the required steps for updating it with a non-overlapping Administrator CAT. This may involve updating ACLs and [NOCs](#node-operational-certificate-noc) on the Nodes wishing to participate in the [Joint Fabric](#joint-fabric-1).
>
> Concern for its use in gaining unauthorized Administer access is mitigated by the fact that the Administrator CAT is a [special subject distinguished name](#x.501-distinguished-names) within the [NOC](#node-operational-certificate-noc) and that the [NOC](#node-operational-certificate-noc) must be issued by an Administrator and not self-issued.
>
> User initiated and granted revocation of an Administrator to administer nodes SHALL be achieved by updating the Administrator CAT. The Joint Fabric Anchor Administrator SHALL increment the version number of the Administrator CAT to a value higher than its current value (e.g., from 0x0000 to 0x0001), update the existing credentials ([NOC](#node-operational-certificate-noc)) for all Administrator Nodes that are NOT being revoked with the new version of the Administrator CAT, and update the ACL entry of all Nodes whose subject list contains the prior version of the Administrator CAT with the new version of the Administrator CAT. This has the effect of revoking the Administer access of any Administrator Nodes that did not receive updated credentials ([NOC](#node-operational-certificate-noc)) with the new version of the Administrator CAT. Com­ pleting this operation requires visiting all the nodes in the [Joint Fabric](#joint-fabric-1), a task which might take a long time to complete or might never complete if some Nodes are permanently offline or otherwise unreachable. However, any Nodes that are permanently offline are probably not at risk due to the no longer trusted Administrator Node because they are inaccessible to it.

#### Anchor CAT

> Any Node advertising as a [Joint Fabric](#joint-fabric-1) Anchor SHALL contain the Anchor CAT in its NOC. A NOC containing the Anchor CAT SHALL be issued only by the [Joint Fabric](#joint-fabric-1) Anchor ICAC.
>
> Any client that discovers a Anchor Node with DNS-SD and connects to the Node via CASE SHALL check if the Anchor CAT or the Anchor/Datastore CAT is present in the NOC of the Node and the NOC chains up to the [Anchor ICAC](#anchor-icac-requirements).
>
> If the Node also has the role of a Datastore then the [Anchor/Datastore CAT](#anchordatastore-cat) SHALL be used instead.

#### Datastore CAT

> A NOC containing the Datastore CAT SHALL be issued by any [Joint Fabric](#joint-fabric-1) Administrator.
>
> Any client that discovers a Datastore Node with DNS-SD and connects to the Node via CASE SHALL check if the Datastore CAT or the Anchor/Datastore CAT is present in the NOC of the NODE as part of the CASE handshake. This SHALL be required in order to verify that the Node is authorized to act as a Datastore in the [Joint Fabric](#joint-fabric-1).
>
> If the Node is also a [Joint Fabric](#joint-fabric-1) Anchor then the [Anchor/Datastore CAT](#anchordatastore-cat) SHALL be used instead.

#### Anchor/Datastore CAT

> A NOC containing the Anchor/Datastore CAT SHALL be issued only by the Anchor ICAC.
>
> Any client that discovers an Anchor/Datastore Node with DNS-SD and connects to the Node via CASE SHALL check the Anchor/Datastore CAT is present in the NOC of the Node as part of the CASE handshake. This SHALL be required in order to verify that the Node is authorized to act as an Anchor and Datastore in the [Joint Fabric](#joint-fabric-1).

### Joint Commissioning Method (JCM)

> **NOTE** Support for Joint Commissioning Method is provisional.
>
> This method SHALL be implemented for Commissioners and Administrators that support Joint Fab­ ric. Given a pre-existing Matter fabric Fabric A managed by an Ecosystem A with its own adminis­ trator nodes and commissioner nodes, a Joint Fabric can be created with another Ecosystem B such that all devices of Ecosystem A and Ecosystem B can communicate using a single operational root of trust and devices can be added to the new joint fabric by either Ecosystem.
>
> The joint operation ensures that ICA’s from both Fabric A and Fabric B are signed by the Anchor CA (the Root CA of the fabric selected to become the Anchor Fabric), establishing a common trust between all devices of the original Fabric A and Fabric B and all newly added devices to the “Joint Fabric”.
>
> The Joint Fabric contains multiple ecosystems whose ICACs are cross-signed by the Anchor CA. Therefore, all ecosystems participating in the [Joint Fabric](#joint-fabric-1) SHALL use an [ICAC](#intermediate-ca-ica-certificate) to sign [NOCs](#node-operational-certificate-noc). Signing NOCs with a Root CA different than the Anchor CA is not permitted in the Joint Fabric.
>
> The following steps describe JCM. In the figure below, Ecosystem A with Fabric A acts as the Anchor Fabric and Ecosystem B with Fabric B as joining fabric to create a Joint Fabric between the two Ecosystems.

1.  Commission an Administrator from the Ecosystem B (Eco B Admin) using either [ECM](#enhanced-commissioning-method-ecm) or [BCM](#basic-commissioning-method-bcm)

> triggered by one Commissioner device from Ecosystem A (Eco A Commissioner). When Ecosys­ tem B Administrator advertises its presence over DNS-SD (as a result of [Open Commissioning](#opencommissioningwindow-command) [Window](#opencommissioningwindow-command)) it SHALL also advertise the correct [JF TXT key](#txt-key-for-joint-fabric).

2.  Once [ECM](#enhanced-commissioning-method-ecm) or [BCM](#basic-commissioning-method-bcm) is over, Ecosystem B Administrator SHALL check that the NOC belonging to Ecosystem A Administrator (responder NOC field of the [sigma-2-tbsdata](#_bookmark372)) contains either an [Anchor CAT](#anchor-cat) or an [Anchor/Datastore CAT](#anchordatastore-cat).

3.  User Consent must be obtained on Ecosystem B before proceeding with the next steps.

4.  Ecosystem B Administrator SHALL use [ec-pub-key](#public-key), [pub-key-algo](#public-key-algorithm) and [ec-curve-id](#ec-curve-identifier) of [Eco A RCAC](#trustedrootcertificates-attribute) together with [Ecosystem A VendorID](#fabricdescriptorstruct-type) as input parameters for [RCAC based Vendor ID validation](#vendorid-validation-procedure-1).

5.  Ecosystem B Administrator SHALL check that the returned certificate is a RCAC (Basic Con­ straint extension SHALL be marked critical and have the cA field set to TRUE).

6.  Ecosystem B Administrator requests an Administrator from Ecosystem A to sign its ICA by invoking the [ICACSR Request](#icacsrrequest-command) command of the [Joint Fabric PKI Cluster](#joint-fabric-pki-cluster), as described in [ICA Cross](#ica-cross-signing) [Signing](#ica-cross-signing).

7.  Ecosystem A Administrator performs the steps in [ICA Cross Signing](#ica-cross-signing) on the request from the Ecosystem B Administrator.

8.  Cross-signed ICAC is returned to Ecosystem B Administrator using [ICACSR Response](#icacsrresponse-command) command.

9.  Ecosystem B Administrator SHALL use following commands from [Node Operational Credentials](#node-operational-credentials-cluster) [cluster](#node-operational-credentials-cluster) to update each node in the Fabric B to join the Joint Fabric:

    1.  Update [TrustedRootCertificates](#trustedrootcertificates-attribute) by using [AddTrustedRootCertificate](#addtrustedrootcertificate-command)

    2.  Update Node Operational Credentials using [AddNOC](#addnoc-command). Subject DN of the issued NOCs encodes a matter-fabric-id attribute whose value SHALL be identical with the value of the matter- fabric-id attribute from the cross-signed ICAC.

    3.  Remove the old Trusted Root CA Certificate and the associated fabric using the [RemoveFab­](#removefabric-command) [ric](#removefabric-command) command

> Upon successful completion of [JCM](#joint-commissioning-method-jcm), all nodes from Fabric B will be part of the Joint Fabric anchored by the Ecosystem A.

> *Figure 104. Joint Commissioning Steps*

#### Scope of User Consent

> Before commissioning a Joint Fabric Administrator, the user SHALL be asked for consent to enable Joint Fabric functionality between ecosystems. Each ecosystem joining the Joint Fabric SHALL inde­ pendently ask the user for consent.

#### Discovery

> The user SHALL be able to enable JCM through an appropriate interface of the devices on that ecosystem. For example, a mobile application, a web configuration, or an on-device interface.

#### Vendor ID Validation

> The Joint Fabric requires that the fabrics participating in a Joint Fabric perform mutual Vendor ID validation so that they can be sure of the authenticity of the Vendor ID being asserted. Vendor ID validation SHALL be achieved by using the [VendorID Validation Procedure](#vendorid-validation-procedure-1).

#### ICA Cross Signing

> As described in the [Joint Commissioning Method](#joint-commissioning-method-jcm), an Ecosystem Administrator, different than the Joint Fabric Anchor Administrator, SHALL have the ability to issue [NOCs](#node-operational-certificate-noc) chaining up to the Anchor CA. To obtain this ability it SHALL receive an [ICAC](#intermediate-ca-ica-certificate) issued by the Joint Fabric Anchor Administrator. Cross-signing means that the SubjectPublicKey of the [ICAC](#intermediate-ca-ica-certificate) chaining up to the Anchor CA is identical to the SubjectPublicKey of the pre-installed [ICAC](#intermediate-ca-ica-certificate) (chaining up to that particular Ecosystem Adminis­ trator [RCAC](#trusted-root-ca-certificates)).
>
> The Ecosystem Administrator that needs to obtain a cross-signed ICAC SHALL create a Certificate Signing Request (ICA CSR) as described in [PKCS \#10](#_bookmark45):

1.  ICA CSR SHALL include a signature (see [RFC 2986](#_bookmark45) section 4.2, SignatureAlgorithm) generated using the Private Key of its pre-installed [ICAC](#intermediate-ca-ica-certificate).

2.  The Public Key associated with the Private Key used to sign the ICA CSR SHALL appear in the SubjectPublicKey of the ICA CSR.

3.  Minimum attributes that SHALL be present are shown in the image below. Note that the subject DN SHALL encode a matter-fabric-id attribute. The attribute’s value SHALL be identical to the Fabric ID of the Anchor Fabric.

4.  Once the ICA CSR is created it SHALL be sent in a DER-encoded string inside the [ICACSR](#_bookmark1833) parame­ ter of the [ICACSRRequest](#icacsrrequest-command) command.

> *ICACSR*

[TABLE]

> The ICA cross signing requires a Joint Fabric Anchor Administrator to receive and validate a Certifi­ cate Signing Request by following these steps:

1.  Check that User Consent has been obtained previously or ask for User Consent.

    1.  If User Consent is not obtained, error status SHALL be [IcaCsrRequestNoUserConsent](#_bookmark1827).

2.  Check that the ICA CSR follows the encoding and rules from [PKCS \#10](#_bookmark45).

    1.  Otherwise, error status SHALL be [InvalidIcaCsrFormat](#_bookmark1821).

3.  Check that the signature can be validated using the Public Key of the ICA CSR.

    1.  Otherwise, error status SHALL be [InvalidIcaCsrSignature](#_bookmark1822).

4.  Convert the Subject Public Key Info of the ICA CSR’s to the equivalent Matter certificate TLV val­ ues by using the specific rules for [ec-pub-key](#public-key), [pub-key-algo](#public-key-algorithm) and [ec-curve-id](#ec-curve-identifier).

5.  Perform [ICAC based Vendor ID validation](#vendorid-validation-procedure-1) using as input parameters the ec-pub-key, pub-key- algo, ec-curve-id and the Vendor ID associated with the Administrator requesting the ICA CSR Signing:

    1.  If the output of the validation is an empty list, error SHALL be [FailedDCLVendorIdValidation](#_bookmark1823)

    2.  Check that the DCL returned certificate is an ICAC ([Basic Constraints extension](#basic-constraints-extension) SHALL be marked critical and have the cA field set to FALSE).

        1.  If not an ICAC, error status SHALL be [NotAnIcac](#_bookmark1824).

6.  Upon success, ICA’s certificate SHALL be signed by the [RCAC](#trusted-root-ca-certificates) of the Joint Fabric Anchor Adminis­ trator.

    1.  If signing fails, error status SHALL be [IcaCsrSigningFailed](#_bookmark1826).

7.  ICAC SHALL be returned in a PEM format inside the [ICAC](#_bookmark1836) field of the [ICACSRResponse](#icacsrresponse-command) com­ mand.

> If any of the above validation checks fail, the server SHALL immediately respond to the client with an [ICACSRResponse](#icacsrresponse-command) command. The [StatusCode](#_bookmark1835) SHALL be set to the error status value specified in the above validation checks.

### Anchor Administrator Selection

> The [Joint Fabric](#joint-fabric-1) design allows devices to communicate with one another regardless of which com­ missioner was used to commission devices. Similarly, devices participating in Joint Fabric can be removed without impacting the remaining devices. If all devices commissioned using a particular commissioner are deleted, the devices remaining in the Joint Fabric will typically continue to func­ tion.
>
> User SHALL provide consent when an Anchor Administrator is removed and a new Anchor CA is chosen. In the example below, the Anchor Administrator is removed from the Joint Fabric and the user has selected a candidate Administrator to be promoted to Anchor Administrator. For clarity, Joint Fabric Anchor Administrator A is being replaced with the candidate Joint Fabric Administrator B.
>
> User consent SHALL be mutual:

- on Administrator A side, User provides consent that transfer of the Anchor role to Administrator

> B is allowed.

- on Administrator B side, User provides consent that receipt of the Anchor role from Administra­ tor A is allowed.

> Flow for Anchor Transfer is as follows:

1.  Administrator B SHALL:

    1.  send [TransferAnchorRequest](#transfer-anchor-request-command) to Administrator A to set itself as Joint Fabric Anchor Adminis­ trator.

    2.  obtain user consent prior to sending the [TransferAnchorRequest](#transfer-anchor-request-command) command.

2.  Administrator A SHALL:

    1.  check that the NOC used by Administrator B during the CASE session contains an Adminis­ trator CAT.

    2.  check that user provided consent that allows the transfer of the Anchor role to a different

> Administrator. If not, then [TransferAnchorResponse](#transfer-anchor-response-command) command with StatusCode set to [Trans­](#_bookmark1830) [ferAnchorStatusNoUserConsent](#_bookmark1830) SHALL be sent and the procedure stopped here.

3.  check all the [Datastore](#joint-fabric-datastore-cluster) entries of type [DatastoreStatusEntry](#datastorestatusentry-type). If any of these entries has a value that equals to Pending or to DeletePending then [TransferAnchorResponse](#transfer-anchor-response-command) command with StatusCode set to [TransferAnchorStatusDatastoreBusy](#_bookmark1829) SHALL be sent and the proce­ dure stopped here.

4.  put Joint Fabric Datastore in read only state by setting the Datastore [StatusEntry](#statusentry-attribute) to Delete­ Pending.

5.  stop DNS SD advertising of the Administrator, Anchor and Datastore capability inside the [JF](#txt-key-for-joint-fabric) [TXT key](#txt-key-for-joint-fabric).

6.  set [BusyAnchorTransfer](#_bookmark1825) error status for the [ICACSRResponse](#icacsrresponse-command) in case an [ICA Cross Signing](#ica-cross-signing) is in progress.

&nbsp;

3.  All other Joint Fabric Administrators SHALL:

    1.  stop commissioning of any new devices into the Joint Fabric once it detects that Datastore [StatusEntry](#statusentry-attribute) equals DeletePending.

4.  Administrator B SHALL:

    1.  copy (through attribute read, BDX) Joint Fabric Datastore from Administrator A.

    2.  set the Datastore [StatusEntry](#statusentry-attribute) to Committed.

    3.  set the value of the Datastore [AnchorNodeId](#anchornodeid-attribute) attribute to the value of its Node ID.

    4.  increase [Administrator CAT](#administrator-cat) version.

    5.  use following commands from [Node Operational Credentials cluster](#node-operational-credentials-cluster) on the other Joint Fab­ ric Administrators:

        1.  update [TrustedRootCertificates](#trustedrootcertificates-attribute) by using [AddTrustedRootCertificate](#addtrustedrootcertificate-command).

        2.  update Node Operational Credentials using [AddNOC](#addnoc-command). NOCs SHALL contain an updated version of the Administrator CAT.

    6.  issue itself a new NOC with the updated version of the Anchor/Datastore CAT.

    7.  set itself as the new Datastore provider and Anchor Administrator by advertising the Admin­ istrator, Anchor and Datastore capabilities inside the [JF TXT key](#txt-key-for-joint-fabric).

    8.  send [TransferAnchorComplete](#transfer-anchor-complete-command) to Administrator A to announce that transition to Anchor Administrator is complete.

5.  All other Joint Fabric Administrators SHALL:

    1.  subscribe to the new Datastore provider (Administrator B) having discovered the new Datas­ tore capability via Service Discovery of the [JF TXT key](#txt-key-for-joint-fabric).

    2.  check that the [NOC](#node-operational-certificate-noc) used by the new Datastore provider (Administrator B) during the first CASE session contains an [Anchor/Datastore CAT](#anchordatastore-cat) and that the NOC chains up to the [Anchor](#anchor-icac-requirements) [ICAC](#anchor-icac-requirements).

    3.  request [ICA Cross Signing](#ica-cross-signing) from the new Joint Fabric Anchor Administrator discovered via Service Discovery (Administrator and Anchor flags are set in [JF TXT key](#txt-key-for-joint-fabric)).

    4.  remove devices from the fabric governed by the old Anchor CA using the [RemoveFabric](#removefabric-command) com­

> mand.

5.  start commissioning devices onto the Joint Fabric using the new ICAC for NOC issuance.

### Administrator Removal

> Since [Joint Fabric](#joint-fabric-1) has multiple [Intermediate NOC Certificate Authorities](#intermediate-ca-ica-certificate) trusted by Joint Fabric Anchor CA, the following steps SHALL be taken to remove an [Intermediate NOC Certificate Author­](#intermediate-ca-ica-certificate) [ity](#intermediate-ca-ica-certificate) from a [Joint Fabric](#joint-fabric-1).
>
> The [RemoveFabric](#removefabric-command) section outlines a Warning that SHALL apply here for removing a Joint Fabric Administrator.

1.  Joint Fabric Anchor Administrator SHALL send a [RemoveFabric](#removefabric-command) command to a Joint Fabric Admin that user has consented to remove.

2.  Joint Fabric Administrator SHALL remove the outgoing Administrator from the Joint Fabric Datastore.

3.  The outgoing Administrator SHALL remove the given Fabric and **delete all associated fabric- scoped data**.

4.  Joint Fabric Anchor Administrator SHALL increase [Administrator CAT](#administrator-cat) version and issue itself a new NOC.

5.  Administrator B SHALL set new [NOC](#node-operational-certificate-noc) for all the Joint Fabric Administrators.

#### 12.2.7.1. Security Consideration

> Matter does not currently include any method for a [Trusted Root Certificate](#trusted-root-ca-certificates) to revoke an ICAC pre­ viously issued. Thus, to ensure proper fail proof removal of a Joint Fabric Administrator from a Joint Fabric, the Anchor Administrator SHOULD trigger a transition to a new [Trusted Root Certifi­](#trusted-root-ca-certificates) [cate](#trusted-root-ca-certificates) as described in the [Anchor Administrator Selection](#anchor-administrator-selection) section. In this case, the new Anchor can be run by the same ecosystem as the old Anchor but the new [Trusted Root Certificate](#trusted-root-ca-certificates) will not issue an ICAC to the Joint Fabric Administrator that is to be removed.

## User Consent

> A user who wishes to have an already commissioned Node join another Fabric (and therefore another Security Domain) provides consent by instructing an existing Administrator, which SHALL put the Node into commissioning mode by using steps outlined in [Section 5.6.4, “Open Commission­](#open-commissioning-window) [ing Window”](#open-commissioning-window). Administrators SHALL provide a mechanism for the user to thus instruct them.

## Administrator-Assisted Commissioning Method

> Administrators SHALL support opening a commissioning window on a Node using the mandatory method described in [Section 5.6.3, “Enhanced Commissioning Method (ECM)”](#enhanced-commissioning-method-ecm). All Nodes SHALL support having a commissioning window opened using the mandatory method described in [Section](#enhanced-commissioning-method-ecm) [5.6.3, “Enhanced Commissioning Method (ECM)”](#enhanced-commissioning-method-ecm).
>
> An Administrator MAY open a commissioning window on a Node using the optional method
>
> described in [Section 5.6.2, “Basic Commissioning Method (BCM)”](#basic-commissioning-method-bcm), if the Node supports the method.

## Node Behavior

> The Node SHALL host an [Section 11.19, “Administrator Commissioning Cluster”](#administrator-commissioning-cluster). The Cluster exposes commands which enable the entry into commissioning mode for a prescribed time, and which SHALL be invoked over a [CASE](#certificate-authenticated-session-establishment-case) secure channel. See [Section 11.19.8.1, “OpenCommissioning­](#opencommissioningwindow-command) [Window Command”](#opencommissioningwindow-command) and [Section 11.19.8.2, “OpenBasicCommissioningWindow Command”](#openbasiccommissioningwindow-command). During such a commissioning window, the Node SHALL maintain its existing configuration, such as its operational network connection and identities, and SHOULD allow normal interactions from other Nodes.

## Fabric Synchronization

### Introduction

> The Fabric Synchronization feature enables commissioning of devices from one fabric to another without requiring user intervention for every device. It defines mechanisms that can be used by multiple ecosystems/controllers to communicate with one another to simplify the experience for users.
>
> The following diagram shows how two ecosystems/controllers would communicate after a single setup sequence.

![](media/image126.png)

> *Figure 105. Example of two synchronized fabrics*

### Terminology

> A component within an ecosystem which supports Fabric Synchronization will be referred to as a **Fabric Synchronizing Administrator**. This includes the Aggregator and Fabric Administrator node(s).
>
> A device which is being synchronized between ecosystems will be referred to as a **Synchronized Device**.

### Fabric Synchronization Composition

> Fabric Synchronization is present when an Aggregator satisfies the FabricSynchronization condi­ tion or one or more Bridged Nodes satisfy the FabricSynchronizedNode condition. (See Device Library, *Aggregator* and *Bridged Node*.)

![](media/image127.png)

> *Figure 106. Composition of a device supporting Fabric Synchronization.*
>
> An Aggregator supporting Fabric Synchronization SHALL be composed of the following compo­ nents.

#### Matter Fabric Administrator Node

> The device providing the Aggregator SHALL be able to commission nodes on its fabric.

#### Aggregator Node

> When Fabric Synchronization is supported, the Aggregator with FabricSynchronization condition (see Device Library, *Aggregator*) SHALL be met on an endpoint with the following endpoints in the Descriptor cluster PartsList.
>
> **Commissioner Control Cluster**
>
> The Commissioner Control Cluster enables another device which supports Fabric Synchronization to set up a bidirectional synchronization relationship without the user having to scan a QR code or enter a Manual Pairing Code (as used in [ECM](#enhanced-commissioning-method-ecm) flow) for a device.
>
> Fabric Synchronization SHALL be supported when the SupportedDeviceCategories attribute in the Commissioner Control Cluster has the FabricSynchronization bit set.
>
> **Bridged Node Endpoint(s)**
>
> Every Bridged Node endpoint presented that conforms to the FabricSynchronizedNode condition (see Device Library, *Bridged Node*) represents a device that can be synchronized (A Synchronized Device).
>
> The Bridged Node with FabricSynchronizedNode condition enables the synchronization of devices between fabrics by the following:

- The Bridged Node SHALL include the Ecosystem Information Cluster. (Enables discovery and directory synchronization.)

- The Bridged Node SHALL include the Administrator Commissioning Cluster when the user con­ sents to share a device. (Enables synchronization of devices between fabrics.)

- The Bridged Node SHOULD support the BridgedICDSupport feature in the Bridged Device Basic Information Cluster if the Synchronized Device is an Intermittently Connected Device (ICD). (Enables communication with ICDs.)

### Preventing Device Duplication

> A Fabric Synchronizing Administrator SHOULD NOT commission devices onto the same fabric that they are already on. To avoid this, the Fabric Synchronizing Administrator SHOULD examine the UniqueID of a potential Synchronized Device’s Bridged Device Basic Information Cluster and SHOULD examine the VendorID and ProductID fields if they are present in the Bridged Device Basic Information Cluster. If all of the provided values for UniqueID, ProductID, and VendorID match a known device that is already on the Fabric Synchronizing Administrator’s fabric, then it SHOULD NOT attempt to commission the device.

#### Missing UniqueID

> The UniqueID field in the Basic Information Cluster became mandatory after the initial release of this specification. Therefore, the following must be performed to support devices without UniqueIDs.
>
> When a Fabric Synchronizing Administrator commissions a Synchronized Device, it SHALL persist and maintain an association with the UniqueID in the Bridged Device Basic Information Cluster exposed by another Fabric Synchronizing Administrator.
>
> If a Fabric Synchronizing Administrator exposes a Synchronized Device which does not have a UniqueID in its Basic Information Cluster, then the Fabric Synchronizing Administrator SHALL gen­ erate and persist a new UniqueID to be used in the Bridged Device Basic Information Cluster.

#### Unifying Generated UniqueID

> When a Fabric Synchronizing Administrator establishes a PASE session to a Synchronized Device for the purposes of commissioning, the Fabric Synchronizing Administrator SHOULD verify that the device is not already present on the intended fabric as follows:

- The Fabric Synchronizing Administrator MAY check if the UniqueID is present in the Basic Information Cluster. If the UniqueID is present, the Fabric Synchronizing Administrator can skip the below check.

- If the UniqueID is not present or not checked, the Fabric Synchronizing Administrator SHOULD check if the intended fabric is already present in the Fabric Table.

  - If it is present, the Fabric Synchronizing Administrator SHOULD NOT complete commission­ ing and SHOULD avoid attempting to commission the device (or establish PASE sessions) in

> the future by persisting the UniqueID exposed by the other Fabric Synchronizing Adminis­ trator’s Bridged Device Basic Information Cluster. (If the Fabric Synchronizing Administra­ tor exposes the device through a Bridged Node endpoint, then the Fabric Synchronizing Administrator SHOULD expose the UniqueID through its Bridged Device Basic Information Cluster.)

- If it is not present, the Fabric Synchronizing Administrator MAY continue the commissioning process.

> To avoid the potential for getting stuck in a loop of checking the device and updating UniqueIDs in the Bridged Device Basic Information Cluster, a caching and tie-breaker policy is required. If a Fab­ ric Synchronizing Administrator updated its Bridged Device Basic Information Cluster as a result of a duplication detected when checking the Fabric Table during a PASE session, then it SHOULD per­ form the following:

- The Fabric Synchronizing Administrator SHOULD create a cache of prior known UniqueIDs scoped to the NodeID of the Synchronized Device. The cache SHOULD have space for at least 5 entries per NodeID.

- If a Fabric Synchronizing Administrator (hereafter denoted A) receives a UniqueID from another Fabric Synchronizing Administrator’s (hereafter denoted B) Bridged Device Basic Infor­ mation Cluster that matches an entry in the cache, but is not the entry currently presented in the Bridged Device Basic Information Cluster of the client Fabric Synchronizing Administrator (A), then the Fabric Synchronizing Administrator (A) SHOULD set the UniqueID in its Bridged Device Basic Information Cluster to the value stored in the cache which is lexicographically smaller than all other entries.

### Changes to device and locations of Synchronized Devices

> A fabric administrator typically has information on topology or logical grouping of the Synchro­ nized Devices, which can be of use to the user when shared with other administrators.
>
> For example, consider a fabric with 50 lights. If the locations (such as rooms) and device naming are not present, the user would just see a list of 50 lights on their synchronized controller and would not know which of those lights would be in which location.
>
> Typically, the user has some means (e.g. a Manufacturer-provided app) to assign names to the Syn­ chronized Devices, or names could be assigned automatically by the administrator. Sometimes these names are written to the Basic Information Cluster on the device, while other times the administrator does not write these names to the Basic Information Cluster.
>
> A Fabric Synchronizing Administrator SHOULD expose such names in the Ecosystem Information Cluster on the associated endpoint. A Fabric Synchronizing Administrator MAY expose such names in the Basic Information Cluster on the associated endpoint.
>
> If a Fabric Synchronizing Administrator exposes such names in the Basic Information Cluster for a Synchronized Device, then the same associated names SHALL be exposed in the Ecosystem Infor­ mation Cluster.
>
> Similarly, the user typically has some means to assign and change the location (e.g. room/zone) names. The grouping MAY also be applied automatically by the administrator.
>
> A Fabric Synchronizing Administrator SHOULD expose such grouping using the Ecosystem Informa­ tion Cluster as described above.
>
> Nodes that wish to be notified of a change in such a name or location SHOULD monitor changes of the Ecosystem Information Cluster.
>
> A Fabric Synchronizing Administrator MAY make it possible (e.g. through a Manufacturer’s app) for its users to restrict whether all or some of the Ecosystem Information Cluster is exposed to the Fab­ ric.

### Changes to the set of Synchronized Devices

> Matter Devices can be added to or removed from the set of Synchronized Devices through Adminis­ trator-specific means. For example, the user can use a Manufacturer-provided app to disable syn­ chronization of specific devices. When an update to the set of synchronized Devices occurs, the Fab­ ric Synchronizing Administrator SHALL:

- Update the PartsList attribute on the Descriptor clusters of the [Root Node Endpoint](#root-node-endpoint) and of the endpoint which holds the Aggregator device type.

- Update the exposed endpoints and their descriptors according to the new set of Synchronized Devices

> Nodes that wish to be notified of added/removed devices SHOULD monitor changes of the PartsList attribute in the Descriptor cluster on the [Root Node Endpoint](#root-node-endpoint) and the endpoint which holds the Aggregator device type.
>
> Allocation of endpoints for Synchronized Devices SHALL be performed as described in [Dynamic](#dynamic-endpoint-allocation) [Endpoint allocation](#dynamic-endpoint-allocation).

### Fabric Synchronized Relationships

> Each Client ecosystem to a Fabric Synchronizing Administrator (possibly multiple unique clients per ecosystem) will use the client ecosystem’s fabric to commission the Aggregator. The client ecosystems will each have their own dedicated, isolated fabric that is separate from the fabric used by the Aggregator to interact with the Matter devices.
>
> This relationship can be seen in the [overview figure](#_bookmark1869). In that figure, Ecosystem E1 can directly access all devices and the Aggregator of Ecosystem E2 from Ecosystem E1’s fabric. This is done with­ out requiring Ecosystem E2 to have any access granted on Ecosystem E1’s fabric.

### Setup flow for Fabric Synchronization

> This section will cover generic setup sequences, which ecosystems MAY extend to provide the desired level of configuration options.

#### Fabric Synchronization Mutual Authentication

> As a precondition to enabling the Fabric Synchronization feature, ecosystems MAY wait until the complete bi-directional commissioning of both ecosystems has been completed before exposing any
>
> Bridged Nodes. At this point, both ecosystems have received the device attestation from the other.

#### Scope of User Consent

> Before or after commissioning a Fabric Synchronizing Administrator, the user SHALL be asked for consent to enable Fabric Synchronization functionality between ecosystems. This matches the exist­ ing single-device Administrator-Assisted Commissioning consent model that requires user consent when Matter devices are shared.
>
> Each ecosystem SHALL independently ask the user for consent. This can be done before or after commissioning the device.
>
> Similar to the Multi-Admin flow, after the share operation has been completed, the second Admin can now perform additional sharing operations with the device and/or data according to consent the user has given the second ecosystem.

#### Starting Condition

> For the purpose of demonstrating the setup process, consider two ecosystems that provide Fabric Synchronization. These may have existing Matter devices commissioned on their independent fab­ rics.

#### Enabling Fabric Synchronization Between Two Ecosystems

> **User Action Summary (Informational)**
>
> To initiate the setup of Fabric Synchronization, the manufacturer-specific setup SHOULD include the following steps:

1.  Scan a QR code or enter the Manual Pairing Code of the Commissionee Fabric Synchronizing Administrator. This is similar to the current [Administrator-Assisted Commissioning](#administrator-assisted-commissioning-flows) of Matter devices.

2.  Consent and configure relationships on both ecosystems. (The Commissionee ecosystem MAY provide a configuration step prior to providing the QR code or Manual Pairing Code.)

> If full bi-directional Fabric Synchronization is enabled, the end result of the setup process will
>
> resemble the [Introductory Example](#_bookmark1869).
>
> **Initiating Discovery**
>
> The user SHALL be able to enable the administrator-assisted commissioning of an ecosystem’s Fab­ ric Synchronization feature through an appropriate interface of the devices on that ecosystem. For example, a mobile application, a web configuration, or an on-device interface.
>
> The Fabric Synchronizing Administrator that advertises its presence over DNS-SD will be desig­ nated the Commissionee. The Fabric Synchronizing Administrator that performs service discovery will be designated the Commissioner.
>
> The Commissionee SHALL provide the user with Manual Pairing Code and MAY provide the user with a QR code to initiate commissioning of the Commissionee by the Commissioner.
>
> **Discovery**
>
> The Commissionee SHALL advertise its presence over DNS-SD (see [Section 5.4.2.7, “Using Existing](#using-existing-ip-bearing-network) [IP-bearing Network”](#using-existing-ip-bearing-network) and [Commissionable Node Discovery](#commissionable-node-discovery).)
>
> A Commissioner MAY discover the Commissionee device and provide the user with a notification prior to additional user action.

![](media/image129.png)

> *Figure 108. Fabric Synchronization Setup - Commissioner Relationship Established.*
>
> **Forward Commissioning**
>
> The user SHALL then be able to initiate commissioning on another administrator with the Fabric Synchronization feature using the provided QR code or manual pairing code from the Commis­ sioner.
>
> The Commissioner SHALL commission the Commissionee using the steps outlined in the [Concur­](#_bookmark547) [rent connection commissioning flow](#_bookmark547).
>
> After commissioning is complete, the Commissionee Fabric Synchronizing Administrator’s Aggrega­ tor will now be accessible on the Fabric administrated by the Commissioner.

> ![](media/image130.png)
>
> *Figure 109. Fabric Synchronization Setup - Forward Commissioning Complete.*
>
> **Reverse Commissioning**
>
> After the Commissioner has finished commissioning the Commissionee, the Commissioner SHOULD initiate Reverse Commissioning using the Commissioner Control Cluster.
>
> **NOTE** A Commissionee Fabric Synchronizing Administrator MAY choose to require reverse commissioning before enabling Fabric Synchronization.

> *Figure 110. Fabric Synchronization Setup - Reverse Commissioning Complete.*
>
> **Fabric Synchronization Configuration**
>
> After or before commissioning (and optionally Reverse Commissioning,) the device-appropriate interfaces for the Fabric Synchronization feature SHALL ask the user for consent to synchronize devices between fabrics according to [Scope Of User Consent](#scope-of-user-consent-1).
>
> The following are example configurable options:

- The Fabric Synchronization feature MAY ask the user for consent for all Synchronized Devices or consent for smaller subsets independently.

- The Fabric Synchronization feature MAY ask the user for consent to perform this operation

> automatically when new Synchronized Devices are commissioned.

- The Fabric Synchronization feature MAY ask the user for consent to share Synchronized Device metadata such as device names and locations.

> **Fabric Synchronization**
>
> Once commissioning and configuration are complete, the ecosystems are now ready to synchronize their fabrics.
>
> The Fabric Synchronizing Administrator SHALL commission the synchronized devices as config­ ured by the user.
>
> Commissioning of Matter devices SHALL be performed by:

1.  Discover available Synchronized Devices to commission by identifying endpoints specified in the PartsList of the Aggregator within the Fabric Synchronizing Administrator.

2.  Identify if the Synchronized Device supports the BridgedICDSupport feature in the Bridged Device Basic Information Cluster by presence of the BridgedICDSupport feature.

> a\. If the BridgedICDSupport feature is present, the client MAY use the BridgedICDSupport fea­ ture to ensure the device is active.

3.  Initiate commissioning by sending an Open Commissioning Window command to the Adminis­ trator Commissioning Cluster exposed on the endpoint with the Bridged Node device type speci­ fied in the PartsList and the Administrator Commissioning Cluster present.

4.  Complete commissioning using the Enhanced Commissioning Method.

# Chapter 13. Security Requirements

## Overview

> Each Matter security and privacy requirement references the underlying countermeasure (CM) and threat (T) in the Threat Model that motivated the need for the requirement. The requirements are grouped by topic. Unless stated otherwise, these requirements typically address all Devices and Nodes (i.e. all implementations of Matter functionality). Some requirements are called out specifi­ cally for a particular group of implementations, or Roles.

## Device vs. Node

> For some requirements, we need to differentiate between a Node (the entity which supports the Matter protocol stack) and a Device (a piece of equipment containing one or more Nodes).

- If the Node contains all of the Matter functionality, nevertheless it will probably rely on some security features of the Device.

- If the Node uses Matter functionality provided by the Device, the requirements obviously hold for both the Node and the Device.

## Commissioning

1.  Nodes SHALL stop both commissioning and unsecured rendezvous actions after a specified time period from the beginning of the commissioning mode when commissioning has not been con­ cluded, unless allowed for other purposes such as [Commissionable Node Discovery](#commissionable-node-discovery). The time period for commissioning and unsecured rendezvous announcements SHALL follow require­ ments as specified in [Section 5.5, “Commissioning Flows”](#commissioning-flows) and [Section 5.4.2.3, “Announcement](#announcement-duration) [Duration”](#announcement-duration) respectively. \[CM8 for T5, T7\]

2.  Nodes SHALL utilize multiple hash iterations in PBKDF, as required by definitions in [Section 3.9,](#password-based-key-derivation-function-pbkdf) [“Password-Based Key Derivation Function (PBKDF)”](#password-based-key-derivation-function-pbkdf). Nodes SHALL validate the bounds of the iteration count for PBKDF, to respect the minimum and maximum values stated in the cryptog­ raphy primitives section (see [Section 3.9, “Password-Based Key Derivation Function (PBKDF)”](#password-based-key-derivation-function-pbkdf)). \[CM99 in T102\]

3.  Nodes SHALL exit commissioning mode after 20 failed commission attempts (see [Section 5.5,](#commissioning-flows) [“Commissioning Flows”](#commissioning-flows)). \[CM100 for T101, T112\]

4.  Devices SHALL include a Device Attestation Certificate and private key, unique to that Device. \[CM23 for T22, T24, T34, T86\]

5.  When the setup code is not permanently attached to a device, for example, it is removable or only found in the device setup guide, the device SHALL NOT deliver the Onboarding Payload using an NFC tag \[CM4 for T90\].

6.  If an [NFC Tag](#nfc-tag) is used to convey the Onboarding Payload from a device to a Commissioner, depending on how the NFC tag is associated with the device (e.g. device package, attached to the device, connected to the device…), the NFC Tag SHALL only allow the alteration of the Onboard­ ing Payload and the reading thereof in ways and in device states attackers cannot exploit to illic­

> itly onboard the device (e.g., the alteration of the NFC Tag Onboarding Payload SHALL only be possible while being manufactured, the NFC tag read-out SHALL NOT be possible when the device is still in the packaging, the NFC Tag read-out SHALL only be allowed during the enabled commissioning window). \[CM4 for T90\]

7.  After initial Commissioning of a Device, subsequent Commissioning SHALL only be triggered by an Administrator or an equivalent entity where the user gives administrative consent. \[CM2 for T1\]

## Factory Reset

1.  Devices and Nodes SHALL have a factory reset capability. \[CM15 for T16, T17, T79, T82\]

2.  Factory reset SHALL remove from the Node all security- and privacy-related data and key mate­ rial created during or after commissioning except data explicitly required to persist across resets. \[CM35 for T16, T17, T79, T82\]

> See the following sections for detailed factory reset requirements.

- [Section 6.4.3, “Node Operational Identifier Composition”](#node-operational-identifier-composition)

- [Section 6.4.11, “Security Considerations”](#security-considerations)

- [Section 6.6.3, “Access Control List Examples”](#access-control-list-examples)

- [Section 7.12.1, “Persistence”](#persistence)

- [Section 7.14, “Event”](#event)

- [Section 11.12, “General Diagnostics Cluster”](#general-diagnostics-cluster)

- [Section 11.20.4.2, “Image Verification”](#image-verification)

- [NOCs](#nocs-attribute)

- [Fabrics](#fabrics-attribute)

- [CommissionedFabrics](#commissionedfabrics-attribute)

- [TrustedRootCertificates](#trustedrootcertificates-attribute)

## Firmware

1.  Nodes SHALL support OTA firmware updates, either using Matter-provided means (see [Section](#over-the-air-ota-software-update) [11.20, “Over-the-Air (OTA) Software Update”](#over-the-air-ota-software-update)) or proprietary means. \[CM58 for T59, T226\]

2.  Nodes SHALL validate the authenticity and integrity of the firmware prior to installation, such as through cryptographic means (see [Section 11.20.4.2, “Image Verification”](#image-verification)). \[CM58 for T59, T226\]

3.  Nodes SHOULD validate configuration and input for length, and acceptable values and ranges before applying them. This validation is dependent on the configuration or input being applied (see [Section 9.10, “Access Control Cluster”](#access-control-cluster)). Configuration and input validation is explicitly defined in relevant sections of the specification. \[CM46 for T55\]

## Security Best Practices

> This section describes best practices that Matter implementors SHOULD implement. Matter imple­ menters SHALL indicate whether they comply or not to the best practices. Matter certification will not itself test that these requirements have been met.

### Cryptography

1.  Devices and Nodes SHOULD include protection (if it exists) against known remote attacks that can be used to extract or infer cryptographic key material. \[CM107 for T94\]

2.  Devices SHOULD protect the confidentiality of attestation (DAC) private keys. The level and nature of protection for these keys may vary depending on the nature of the Device. \[CM77 for T22\]

3.  Nodes SHOULD protect the confidentiality of Node Operational Private Keys. The level and nature of protection for these keys may vary depending on the nature of the Nodes. \[CM87 for T87, T110, T120\]

4.  Cryptographic keys SHALL be randomly chosen using a cryptographically secure random num­ ber generator in accordance with algorithms defined in [Section 3.1, “Deterministic Random Bit](#deterministic-random-bit-generator-drbg) [Generator (DRBG)”](#deterministic-random-bit-generator-drbg). \[CM39 for T39\]

5.  Devices SHALL use non-repeating initialization vectors for a given session key. \[CM78 for T81\]

### Commissioning and Administration

6.  Manufacturers SHOULD control the number of DACs issued under their Vendor ID. \[CM24 for T23, T34\]

7.  Where practical, the setup code SHOULD NOT be photograph-able or visible when installed (e.g., QR code hidden with a flap). \[CM89 for T90\]

8.  Uncommissioned Devices SHOULD only be available to be commissioned with some form of physical proximity user interaction (e.g. power cycle or button press). \[CM3 for T15, T90, T92\]

9.  For Devices subject to physical tampering (e.g. doorbell, camera, door lock, devices designed for outdoor use cases), the physical interaction to initiate commissioning and/or the setup code (QR code, NFC Tag or Manual code) SHOULD NOT be accessible to a physical attacker. E.g. setup code is removable or not on the device, the button used to initiate commissioning for the lock is inside the house. \[CM4 for T3, T84\]

10. A Commissioner or Administrator SHOULD only add Root Certificates that it trusts to a Node. \[CM36 for T153\]

11. A device manufacturer SHOULD implement [Basic Commissioning Method](#basic-commissioning-method-bcm) only for devices that adequately secure the [Passcode](#passcode). \[CM154 for T173\]

12. Commissioners and Administrators SHOULD carefully control which Nodes get Administer, Manage, or Operate privilege, especially for safety-critical systems like Door Locks and Smoke CO Alarms. \[CM244 for T17, T20, T59, T94, T230\]

### Firmware

13. Vendors of Matter implementations (including their suppliers of Matter functionality) SHOULD have a public vulnerability reporting mechanism and policy and actively monitor, identify and rectify in a timely manner security vulnerabilities throughout the publicly stated security life- cycle policy of the product. Typical responsible disclosure guidelines allow vendors from 60 to 120 days to patch a vulnerability, but the implementation of such a program is at each vendor’s discretion. \[CM59 for T9, T226\]

14. Devices SHOULD have a verified boot based in an immutable root of trust to verify the authen­ ticity of firmware. Commissioners SHOULD only be loaded on a computing platform that has such a verified boot. If devices cannot support verified boot, devices SHOULD perform verifica­ tion on any firmware update before applying the new firmware. \[CM22 for T16, T20, T226\]

15. The private part of the code signing key (used to sign firmware) SHOULD be strongly protected against disclosure or misuse. For example, it could be stored in an HSM on a secure server out­ side the factory with very restricted access to only a small number of Device Manufacturer employees. \[CM28 for T72\]

### Manufacturing

16. Fusing of Devices in production SHOULD be done to limit unintended access to hardware com­ ponents. For example, vendors may disable debug interfaces, and program trust anchors for secure boot. There are multiple options to secure fusing on the factory floor (e.g., physically securing the fusing station, pre-fusing the silicon, etc). \[CM113 for T117\]

### Resiliency

17. Matter implementations SHOULD implement resiliency features (e.g., responding to secure boot failures with recovery or error signaling mode) to detect and handle compromise. \[CM57 for T59, T226\]

### Battery Powered Devices

18. Battery powered Devices SHOULD respond to excessive queries by rate limiting (even limiting the rate to zero if desired). \[CM51 for T52, T53\]

### Tamper Resistance

19. Protection against physical attacks (especially those that impact cybersecurity) MAY be needed for some Devices, as determined by the manufacturer. \[CM62 for T60\]

### Bridging

20. Admins SHOULD only grant privileges to a Bridge or Bridged Device (sending commands from that Bridged Device towards a Matter node) that the User is comfortable implicitly granting to all other Bridged Devices exposed by that Bridge. Background: Matter’s ACL mechanism does not provide a way to grant privileges to only a single endpoint (Bridged Device) from a node (the Bridge). \[CM149 for T162, T165, and T167\]

### Distributed Compliance Ledger

21. Vendors SHOULD avail themselves of the DCL store-and-forward functionality so that they can control posting of data about their products to the DCL. \[CM160 for T170\]

22. Access to Validator Nodes SHOULD be restricted (e.g., with VPN that only permits Validator Nodes, Observer Nodes, and authenticated clients with write access). \[CM163 for T169, T177, T180, T183, T186\]

23. Vendors SHOULD run and use their own Observer Nodes and restrict access to it to make sure that it stays available to the vendors' DCL clients. \[CM166 for T180, T182\]

24. Vendors SHOULD protect DCL private keys in Hardware Security Module (HSM) equipped servers. \[CM167 for T168, T186\]

25. All parameters passed in transactions and queries to the DCL SHALL pass input validation checks done by the implementation of the DCL. \[CM169 for T185\]

### Safety

26. Safety-relevant Devices SHOULD revert to a safe state before performing operations that will result in an outage (e.g., restart or firmware update) and, if possible, when an outage is detected. Safety-relevant Devices are Devices whose operation may have a safety or physical impact. The definitions of "safety-relevant" and "safe state" may vary depending on the kind of Device and on that Device’s usage. \[CM263 for T249\]

27. Vendors SHOULD implement controls to ensure that safety-relevant Devices remain safe and can enter a failsafe state. Any settings that could lead to a safety or physical impact and which can be modified via Matter clusters, SHOULD be vetted and ignored if outside safe limits. For example, maximum temperature of Water Heaters should remain at factory setting and never change during the lifetime of the device. \[CM269 for T55\]

28. Energy Management SHOULD NOT make automated decisions based on unauthenticated data. When using such data, it should treat it as advisory only. Examples include weather data that is pulled in from online resources or tariff and grid event data provided by Utilities. \[CM254 to T239\]

| **ID** | **Description** |
|----|----|
| CM2 | After initial Commissioning of a Device, subsequent Commissioning can only be triggered by an Administrator or an equivalent entity where the user gives administrative consent. |
| CM3 | Commissioning is started with some form of physical user interaction (e.g. power cycle or button press). |
| CM4 | For Devices subject to physical tampering (e.g. doorbell, camera, door lock, devices designed for outdoor use cases), the physical interaction to initiate com­ missioning and/or the setup code is not accessible to a physical attacker. E.g. setup Passcode is removable or not on the device, the button for the lock is inside the house. |

| **ID** | **Description** |
|----|----|
| CM5 | All Devices include a randomly generated setup passcode and a corresponding passcode verifier derived from the setup passcode via a PBKDF. The setup code includes at least 27 bits of entropy compliant with a recognized standard (e.g., NIST SP 800-90B). |
| CM6 | Unsecured rendezvous are enabled by a user action and, upon time-out or com­ missioning failure, will cause deletion of any state information. Examples of "user actions" are pressing a physical button, power-cycling a Device, and leveraging a previously commissioned account. |
| CM7 | Minimize OS and other version information advertised during discovery. |
| CM8 | Both commissioning and unsecured rendezvous actions time-out after at most 15 minutes from the beginning of the commissioning mode when commissioning has not been concluded. |
| CM15 | Devices have a physical button or trigger for factory reset. |
| CM16 | Devices rotate keys at specified triggers (e.g. Factory Device Reset). |
| CM17 | Devices implement Perfect Forward secrecy key agreement protocols that give assurances that session keys will not be compromised even if long-term secrets used in the session key exchange are compromised. |
| CM20 | Revoke Device credentials and privileges when the Device is removed from the home. |
| CM21 | Devices have cryptographically signed firmware, including all firmware and soft­ ware on the Device. |
| CM22 | Devices have a verified boot based in an immutable root of trust to verify the authenticity of firmware. |
| CM23 | All Devices include a Device Attestation Certificate and private key, unique to that Device. |
| CM24 | Manufacturers control the number of DACs issued under their Vendor ID. |
| CM28 | Private part of code signing key is strongly protected against disclosure or misuse. For example, it could be stored in an HSM on a secure server outside the factory with very restricted access to only a small number of Device Manufacturer employees. |
| CM35 | Factory reset removes all local data and key material created during or after com­ missioning except data explicitly required to persist across resets. |
| CM36 | A Commissioner / Administrator only adds Root Certificates that it trusts to a node. |
| CM39 | Cryptographic keys are randomly chosen using the strong entropy separately required and the cryptographic algorithms and key lengths specified by Matter. |
| CM41 | Administrators can view the set of Fabrics on each Device (i.e., Attributes for the Node Operational Credentials Cluster). |

| **ID** | **Description** |
|----|----|
| CM44 | Administrator responds to reported or detected attacks and malfunctions (e.g., by adding Devices to a denylist, notifying the user, changing group keys, or hopping channels). |
| CM45 | Configuration for secure channel protocol is carefully negotiated and validated by both parties. |
| CM46 | Devices validate configuration and input changes for length, character type, and acceptable values and ranges before applying them. This validation is dependent on the configuration or input being applied (e.g. ACL entries). Configuration and input validation is explicitly defined in relevant sections of the specification. |
| CM47 | Device management service uses a secure communication mechanism for recon­ figuration. |
| CM51 | Battery powered Devices respond to excessive queries by rate limiting (even limit­ ing the rate to zero if desired). |
| CM57 | Devices implement resiliency features (e.g., responding to secure boot failures with recovery or error signaling mode) to detect and handle compromise. |
| CM58 | Devices support OTA firmware updates. Devices validate the authenticity and integrity of the firmware prior to installation. |
| CM59 | Manufacturers monitor newly discovered vulnerabilities and provide software updates to address them. |
| CM62 | Protection against physical attacks (especially those that impact cybersecurity) is needed for some Devices, as determined by the manufacturer. |
| CM76 | All DCL writers constantly watch for DCL changes that relate to them and com­ plain about them if they are unauthorized. |
| CM77 | All Devices protect the confidentiality of attestation (DAC) private keys. The level and nature of protection for these keys may vary depending on the nature of the Device. |
| CM78 | Devices use random initialization vectors. |
| CM87 | All Nodes protect the confidentiality of operational credential private keys. The level and nature of protection for these keys may vary depending on the nature of the Nodes. |
| CM89 | The setup code is not photographable (e.g., NFC) or not visible when installed (e.g., QR code hidden with a flap). |
| CM99 | Devices utilize multiple hashes in PBKDF. |
| CM100 | Device exits commissioning mode after 20 failed commissioning attempts. |
| CM101 | Use PKI best practices for all CAs, including secure backup of private key, use of an HSM, four eyes principle, etc. These are described in the PKI CP. |
| CM107 | Devices include protection (if it exists) against known remote attacks that can be used to extract or infer cryptographic key material. |

| **ID** | **Description** |
|----|----|
| CM110 | Devices support remote Firmware attestation with trusted root of measurement to allow local and cloud agents to validate the cryptographic identity of the Device firmware and refuse to perform actions on behalf of or by relying to information acquired by known compromised versions. Firmware attestation is performed at initial commissioning and when revocation lists get updated. |
| CM112 | ACLs restrict access granted to Nodes. |
| CM113 | Fusing of Production Devices is done correctly. For example, disabling debug interfaces, and programming trust anchors for secure boot. There are multiple options to secure fusing on the factory floor (e.g., physically securing the fusing station, pre-fusing the silicon, etc). |
| CM117 | Design, implement, and operate the PAI and associated infrastructure so that unauthorized Devices cannot be created with proper credentials. |
| CM149 | Administrators only grant privileges to a Bridge if the Administrator is comfort­ able granting those same privileges to all Bridged Devices behind that Bridge. |
| CM152 | Device manufacturers provide a way to secure a static [Passcode](#passcode) after initial com­ missioning so that it is not available for unauthorized agents. |
| CM154 | A device manufacturer implements [Section 5.6.2, “Basic Commissioning Method](#basic-commissioning-method-bcm) [(BCM)”](#basic-commissioning-method-bcm) only for devices that adequately secure the [Passcode](#passcode). |
| CM160 | Vendors sign off on some other entity posting data about their products to the DCL. |
| CM163 | Tightly restrict access to Validator Nodes (e.g., with VPN that only permits Valida­ tor Nodes, Observer Nodes, and authenticated clients with write access). |
| CM166 | Matter vendors run and use their own Observer Node and restrict access to it to make sure that it stays available to that company’s DCL clients. |
| CM167 | Matter vendors protect DCL private keys in HSM equipped servers. |
| CM169 | All parameters passed in transactions and queries to the DCL pass input valida­ tion checks. |
| CM183 | VID & PID are not advertised before Commissioning. |
| CM199 | Light client cryptographically verifies responses received from nodes. |
| CM244 | Commissioners and Administrators carefully control which Nodes get Administer, Manage, or Operate privilege, especially for safety-critical systems like Door Locks and Smoke CO Alarms. |
| CM245 | Device manufacturers consider carefully whether their products that support remotely starting its operation could do harm to the end user; if so, require some additional operations (e.g. attended confirmation for remote start). |
| CM248 | Devices with content launching features require source of content origin and per­ form verification of origin information and display human-friendly information before sharing Video content and/or commands to perform sharing of content |

# Appendix A: Tag-length-value (TLV) Encoding Format

## Scope & Purpose

> The Matter TLV (*Tag-Length-Value*) format is a generalized encoding method for simple structured data, used throughout this specification.
>
> Values in the Matter TLV format are encoded as *TLV elements*. Each TLV element has a type. Ele­ ment types fall into two categories: *primitive types* and *container types*. Primitive types convey fun­ damental data values such as integers and strings. Container types convey collections of elements that themselves are either primitives or containers. The Matter TLV format supports three different container types: structures, arrays and lists.
>
> All valid *TLV encodings* consist of a single top-level element. This value can be either a primitive type or a container type.

## Tags

> A TLV element includes an optional numeric tag that identifies its purpose. A TLV element without a tag is called an *anonymous* element. For elements with tags, two categories of tags are defined: *profile-specific* and *context-specific*.

### Profile-Specific Tags

> Profile-specific tags identify elements globally. A profile-specific tag is a 64-bit number composed of the following fields:

- 16-bit [Vendor ID](#vendor-identifier-vendor-id-vid)

- 16-bit profile number

- 32-bit tag number

> Profile-specific tags are defined either by Matter or by vendors. Additionally the Matter Common Profile includes a set of predefined profile-specific tags that can be used across organizations.

### Context-Specific Tags

> Context-specific tags identify elements within the context of a containing structure element. A con­ text-specific tag consists of a single 8-bit tag number. The meaning of a context-specific tag derives from the structure it resides in, implying that the same tag number may have different meanings in the context of different structures. Effectively, the interpretation of a context-specific tag depends on the tag attached to the containing element. Because structures themselves can be assigned con­ text-specific tags, the interpretation of a context-specific tag may ultimately depend on a nested chain of such tags.
>
> Context-specific tags can only be assigned to elements that are immediately within a structure. This
>
> implies that an element with a context-specific tag cannot appear as the outermost element of a TLV encoding.

### Anonymous Tags

> A special "anonymous tag" is used to denote TLV elements that lack a tag value. Such a TLV element is referred to as an anonymous element.

### Canonical Ordering of Tags

> Where a distinguished ordering of tags is required (e.g. for the purposes of generating a hash or cryptographic signature of elements within a structure), the following ordering rules SHALL be used:

- Anonymous tags SHALL be ordered before all other tags.

- Context-specific tags SHALL be ordered before profile-specific tags.

- Context-specific tags with numerically lower tag values SHALL be ordered before those with higher tag values.

- Profile-specific tags with numerically lower Vendor IDs SHALL be ordered before those with higher Vendor IDs.

- Profile-specific tags with the same Vendor ID, but numerically lower profile numbers SHALL be ordered before those with higher profile numbers.

- Profile-specific tags with the same Vendor ID and the same profile numbers but numerically lower tag numbers SHALL be ordered before those with higher tag numbers.

> The ordering rules SHALL apply to elements at the same level within a container.

## Lengths

> Depending on its type, a TLV element may contain a length field that gives the length, in octets, of the element’s value field. A length field is only present for string types (character and octet strings). Other element types either have a predetermined length or are encoded with a marker that identi­ fies their end.

## Primitive Types

> The Matter TLV format supports the following primitive types:

- Signed integers

- Unsigned integers

- UTF-8 Strings

- Octet Strings

- Single or double-precision floating point numbers (following [IEEE 754-2019](#_bookmark28))

- Booleans

  - Nulls

> Of the primitive types, integers, floating point numbers, booleans and nulls have a predetermined length specified by their type. Octet strings and UTF-8 strings include a length field that gives their lengths in octets.

## Container Types

> The Matter TLV format supports the following container types:

- Structures

- Arrays

- Lists

> Each of the container types is a form of element collection that can contain primitive types and/or other container types. The elements appearing immediately within a container type are called its *members*. A container type can contain any number of member elements, including none. Con­ tainer types can be nested to any depth and in any combination. The end of a container type is denoted by a special element called the ‘end-of-container’ element. Although encoded as a member, conceptually the end-of-container element is not included in the members of the containing type.

### Structures

> A structure is a collection of member elements that each have a distinct meaning. All member ele­ ments within a structure SHALL have a unique tag as compared to the other members of the struc­ ture. Member elements without tags (anonymous elements) are not allowed in structures. The encoded ordering of members in a structure may or may not be important depending on the intent of the sender or the expectations of the receiver. For example, in some situations, senders and receivers may agree on a particular ordering of elements to make encoding and decoding easier.
>
> Where a distinguished ordering of members is required (for example, for the purposes of generat­ ing a hash or cryptographic signature of the structure), the members of the structure SHALL be encoded as specified in [Section A.2.4, “Canonical Ordering of Tags”](#canonical-ordering-of-tags).

### Arrays

> An array is an ordered collection of member elements that either do not have distinct meanings, or whose meanings are implied by their encoded positions in the array. An array can contain any type of element, including other arrays. All member elements of an array SHALL be anonymous ele­ ments – that is, they SHALL be encoded with an anonymous tag.

### Lists

> A list is an ordered collection of member elements, each of which may be encoded with a tag. The meanings of member elements in a list are denoted by their position within the list in conjunction with any associated tag value they may have.
>
> A list can contain any type of element, including other lists. The members of a list may be encoded
>
> with any form of tag, including an anonymous tag. The tags within a list do not need to be unique with respect to other members of the list.

## Element Encoding

> A TLV element is encoded a single control octet, followed by a sequence of tag, length and value octets. Depending on the nature of the element, any of the tag, length or value fields may be omit­ ted.

| **Control Octet** | **Tag**       | **Length**    | **Value** |
|-------------------|---------------|---------------|-----------|
| 1 octet           | 0 to 8 octets | 0 to 8 octets | Variable  |

## Control Octet Encoding

> The control octet specifies the type of a TLV element and how its tag, length and value fields are encoded. The control octet consists of two subfields: an *element type field* which occupies the lower 5 bits, and a *tag control field* which occupies the upper 3 bits.

### Element Type Field

> The element type field encodes the element’s type as well as how the corresponding length and value fields are encoded. In the case of Booleans and the Null value, the element type field also encodes the value itself.

[TABLE]

[TABLE]

> For both signed and unsigned integer types the bottom two bits of the element type field signal the width of the corresponding field as follows:

- 00 — 1 octet

- 01 — 2 octets

- 10 — 4 octets

- 11 — 8 octets

> For UTF-8 and octet string types the bottom two bits of the element type field signal the width of the length field as follows:

- 00 — 1 octet

- 01 — 2 octets

- 10 — 4 octets

- 11 — 8 octets

> For end of container element type the tag control bits are set to 0. Any other combination of the tag control bits for this element type only is reserved. See [Section A.10, “End of Container Encoding”](#end-of-container-encoding).

### Tag Control Field

> The tag control field identifies the form of tag assigned to the element (including none) as well as the encoding of the tag octets.

[TABLE]

## Tag Encoding

> Tags are encoded in 0, 1, 2, 4, 6 or 8 octet widths as specified by the tag control field. Tags consist of up to three numeric fields: a *Vendor ID field*, a *profile number field*, and a *tag number field*. All fields are encoded in little-endian order. The tag fields are ordered as follows:

| **Vendor ID** | **Profile Number** | **Tag Number**    |
|---------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| 0 or 2 octets | 0 or 2 octets      | 1, 2, or 4 octets |

### Fully-Qualified Tag Form

> A profile-specific tag can be encoded in *fully-qualified tag form*, where the encoding includes all three tag components (Vendor ID, profile number and tag number). Two variants of this form are supported, one with a 16-bit tag number and one with a 32-bit tag number. The 16-bit variant SHALL be used with tag numbers \< 65536, while the 32-bit variant SHALL be used with tag num­ bers \>= 65536.

| **Tag Control** | **Vendor ID Size** | **Profile Number Size** | **Tag Number Size** |  |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| 110b | 2 octets | 2 octets | 2 octets | For tag numbers \< 65536 |

[TABLE]

### Implicit Profile Tag Form

> A profile-specific tag can also be encoded in *implicit profile tag form*, where the encoding includes only the tag number, and the Vendor ID and profile number are inferred from the protocol context in which the TLV encoding is communicated. This form also has two variants based on the magni­ tude of the tag number.

| **Tag Control** | **Tag Number Size** |                           |
|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| 100b            | 2 octets            | For tag numbers \< 65536  |
| 101b            | 4 octets            | For tag numbers \>= 65536 |

### Common Profile Tag Form

> A special encoding exists for profile-specific tags that are defined by the Matter Common Profile. These are encoded in the same manner as implicit profile tags except that they are identified as common profile tags, rather than implicit profile tags in the tag control field.

| **Tag Control** | **Tag Number Size** |                           |
|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| 010b            | 2 octets            | For tag numbers \< 65536  |
| 011b            | 4 octets            | For tag numbers \>= 65536 |

### Context-Specific Tag Form

> Context-specific tags are encoded as a single octet conveying the tag number.

| **Tag Control** | **Tag Number Size** |                         |
|-----------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| 001b            | 1 octets            | All tag numbers 0 - 255 |

### Anonymous Tag Form

> Anonymous elements do not encode any tag octets.

| **Tag Control** | **Tag Size** |                 |
|-----------------|--------------|-----------------|
| 000b            | 0 octets     | No data encoded |

## Length Encoding

> Length fields are encoded in 0, 1, 2, 4 or 8 octet widths, as specified by the element type field. Length fields of more than one octet are encoded in little-endian order. The choice of width for the
>
> length field is up to the discretion of the sender, implying that a sender can choose to send more length octets than strictly necessary to encode the value.

## End of Container Encoding

> The end of a container type is marked with a special element called the end-of-container element. The end-of-container element is encoded as a single control octet with the value 18h. The tag con­ trol bits within the control octet SHALL be set to zero, implying that end-of-container element can never have a tag.

| **Control Octet** |
|-------------------|
| 1 octet           |

## Value Encodings

### Integers

> An integer element is encoded as follows:

| **Control Octet** | **Tag**       | **Value**           |
|-------------------|---------------|---------------------|
| 1 octet           | 0 to 8 octets | 1, 2, 4 or 8 octets |

> The number of octets in the value field is indicated by the element type field within the control octet. The choice of value octet count is at the sender’s discretion, implying that a sender is free to send more octets than strictly necessary to encode the value. Within the value octets, the integer value is encoded in little-endian format (two’s complement format for signed integers).

### UTF-8 and Octet Strings

> UTF-8 and octet strings are encoded as follows:

| **Control Octet** | **Tag**       | **Length**    | **Value**         |
|-------------------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| 1 octet           | 0 to 8 octets | 1 to 8 octets | 0 to 2⁶⁴-1 octets |

> The length field of a UTF-8 or octet string encodes the number of octets (not characters) present in the value field. The number of octets in the length field is implied by the type specified in the ele­ ment type field (within the control octet).
>
> For octet strings, the value can be any arbitrary sequence of octets. For UTF-8 strings, the value octets SHALL encode a valid UTF-8 character (code points) sequence. Senders SHALL NOT include a terminating null character to mark the end of a string.

### Booleans

> Boolean elements are encoded as follows:

| **Control Octet** | **Tag**       |
|-------------------|---------------|
| 1 octet           | 0 to 8 octets |

> The value of a Boolean element (true or false) is implied by the type indicated in the element type field.

### Arrays, Structures and Lists

> Array, structure and list elements are encoded as follows:

| **Control Octet** | **Tag**       | **Value**  | **End-of-Container** |
|-------------------|---------------|------------|----------------------|
| 1 octet           | 0 to 8 octets | *Variable* | 1 octet              |

> The value field of an array/structure/list element is a sequence of encoded TLV elements that consti­ tute the members of the element, followed by an end-of-container element. The end-of-container element SHALL always be present, even in cases where the end of the array/structure/list element could be inferred by other means (e.g. the length of the packet containing the TLV encoding).

### Floating Point Numbers

> A floating point number is encoded as follows:

| **Control Octet** | **Tag**       | **Value**     |
|-------------------|---------------|---------------|
| 1 octet           | 0 to 8 octets | 4 or 8 octets |

> The value field of a floating point element contains an [IEEE 754-2019](#_bookmark28) single or double precision floating point number encoded in little-endian format (specifically, the reverse of the order described in External Data Representation, [RFC 4506](#_bookmark52)). The choice of precision is implied by the type specified in the element type field (within the control octet). The sender is free to choose either pre­ cision at their discretion.

### Nulls

> A Null value is encoded as follows:

| **Control Octet** | **Tag**       |
|-------------------|---------------|
| 1 octet           | 0 to 8 octets |

# Appendix B: Tag-length-value (TLV) Schema Definitions

## Introduction

> A TLV Schema provides a simple textual description of the structure of data encoded in the [Matter](#appendix-a-tag-length-value-tlv-encoding-format) [TLV](#appendix-a-tag-length-value-tlv-encoding-format) format. A single TLV Schema MAY define the structure of multiple different TLV-encoded pay­ loads. This section describes the syntax one can use to define a TLV Schema.

### Basic Structure

> A TLV Schema takes the form of a series of definitions. Each definition describes some construct, such as a data type. Each definition has an associated human readable name separated from the definition with a ⇒ symbol. As a mnemonic device, it is useful to read the ⇒ symbol as “is a”. For example, the following definition defines a data type that MAY be used to represent a sensor sam­ ple:
>
> *Example*

[TABLE]

> This example would be read as "*sensor-sample* is a structure containing a *timestamp* and *value*".
>
> A TLV Schema MAY contain multiple definitions. The order of definitions within a TLV Schema is unimportant.

### Keywords

> TLV Schemas employ various keywords when describing a construct. These keywords (e.g. STRUC­ TURE, SIGNED INTEGER, and range) are an inherent part of the schema language. Keywords in TLV Schemas are always case-insensitive. However, by convention, keywords associated with types and other high-level constructs are capitalized for emphasis in text-only contexts.

### Naming

> Each definition in a TLV Schema assigns a human-readable name to the construct being defined. This name serves both as a descriptive title as well as a means to refer to the construct from else­ where in the schema.
>
> Names in TLV Schemas are limited to ASCII alphanumeric characters, plus dash (-) and underscore (\_). Additionally, all names SHALL begin with either an alphabetic character or an underscore. In
>
> general, any name conforming to these rules MAY be used, as long as it does not collide with a [key­](#keywords) [word](#keywords) used by the schema language.

### Namespaces

> The name assigned to a schema construct SHALL be unique relative to all other named constructs in the same scope. To facilitate this, TLV Schemas support a namespacing mechanism similar to that provided in languages like C++.
>
> The names of constructs defined within a namespace definition are only required to be unique within the given namespace. Namespaces themselves MAY be nested to any depth.
>
> Constructs defined in other namespaces MAY be referenced using a name that gives the enclosing namespaces, plus the construct name, each separated by dots (.). Such a multi-part name is called a *scoped name*. For example:
>
> *Namespaces Example*

[TABLE]

> See [namespace-def](#namespace-definition-namespace-def) for further details.

### Qualifiers

> Constructs within a TLV Schema MAY be annotated with additional information using a *qualifier*. Qualifiers appear within square brackets (\[…\]) immediately following the construct they affect. In most cases the use of qualifiers is optional, but there are some situations where the schema syntax requires a qualifier.
>
> Often qualifiers are used to place restrictions on the form or range of values that a construct can assume. For example a [length](#length) qualifier MAY be used to constrain the length of a STRING type:

[TABLE]

> Multiple qualifiers MAY appear within the square brackets, and SHALL be separated by commas. See [Section B.5, “Qualifiers”](#qualifiers-1) for further details.

### Tagging

> In a TLV Schema, [tag numbers](#tags) appear as [qualifiers](#qualifiers) attached to a particular named construct, such as a field within a structure. This association reflects the tag’s role as an alias for the textual name in the TLV encoding. The syntax for tag qualifiers is defined in [tag](#tag). For example:
>
> *Tagging Example*

[TABLE]

## Definitions

> A Matter TLV Schema consists of a set of one or more definitions. The definitions that MAY appear within a schema are:

- [type-def](#type-definition-type-def)

- [field-group-def](#field-group-definition-field-group-def)

- [namespace-def](#namespace-definition-namespace-def)

- [protocol-def](#protocol-definition-protocol-def)

- [vendor-def](#vendor-definition-vendor-def)

### Type Definition (type-def)

> *Type Definition Syntax*

[TABLE]

[TABLE]

> A type definition associates a name (type-name) with a schema construct representing a TLV type or [pseudo-type](#pseudo-types). The given name serves as a descriptive title for the type, as well as a means to refer to the type from elsewhere in the schema.
>
> Type definitions (type-def) are often used to describe TLV types that appear directly in some form of communication. For example, a type definition MAY define the structure of data carried within the payload of a message. Some type definitions may be used to define general purpose TLV con­ structs which are then employed in the definitions of other types.
>
> The type (type-name) associated with a type definition MAY be any one of the available TLV types or pseudo-type. Alternatively, a type definition MAY contain a scoped type (scoped-type-name) referring to another type definition appearing elsewhere in the schema. This form is referred to as a type ref­ erence (type-ref). The ordering of type definitions and type references within a schema is unimpor­ tant, implying that a type reference MAY refer to a type that is defined later in the schema.
>
> A [tag](#tag) qualifier MAY be applied to the name within a type definition to associate a default tag with that name. The default tag will be used in an encoding of the type whenever an explicit tag has not been given.

### FIELD GROUP Definition (field-group-def)

> *FIELD GROUP Definition Syntax*

[TABLE]

[TABLE]

> FIELD GROUP declares a collection of fields that MAY be included in a TLV [Structure](#structures). A FIELD GROUP is never directly encoded in a TLV encoding. A FIELD GROUP is used with includes statement to define common patterns of fields such that they MAY be reused across different STRUCTURE definitions.
>
> A FIELD GROUP definition (field-group-def) contains a list of field definitions, each of which gives the type of the field, its tag, and an associated textual name. The field type MAY be either a fundamen­ tal type, a CHOICE OF pseudo-type, an ANY pseudo-type, or a reference to one of these types defined outside the FIELD GROUP definition.
>
> A FIELD GROUP definition MAY also contain one or more includes statements. Each such statement identifies another FIELD GROUP whose fields are to be included within the referencing FIELD GROUP. Such nested inclusion MAY be specified to any depth.
>
> The rules governing the names and tags associated with fields within a FIELD GROUP are the same as those defined for [STRUCTURE](#structure).
>
> *FIELD GROUP Definition Examples*

[TABLE]

### Namespace Definition (namespace-def)

> *Namespace Definition Syntax*

[TABLE]

> namespace introduces a new naming scope. Definitions that appear within the braces of a name­ space definition are scoped to that namespace, such that their names need only be unique within the bounds of the enclosing scope. The namespace scoped definitions SHALL be separated by com­ mas.
>
> In general, four forms of definitions MAY appear within a namespace: type definitions ([type-def](#type-definition-type-def)), FIELD GROUP definitions ([field-group-def](#field-group-definition-field-group-def)), protocol definitions ([protocol-def](#protocol-definition-protocol-def)) and further namespace definitions ([namespace-def](#namespace-definition-namespace-def)). Namespace definitions MAY be nested to any level. Protocol defini­ tions, however, are restricted such that they SHALL NOT be nested. Thus a namespace can only con­ tain a protocol definition if the namespace itself is not located, at any level, within another protocol definition.
>
> The name used in a namespace definition MAY be either a simple name, such as a, or a scoped-name, such as a.b.c. When a scoped-name is used, the effect is exactly as if multiple nested namespaces had been declared, each named after a part of the scoped name.
>
> It is legal to have multiple namespace definitions, each with the same name, defined within the same scope. The effect is as if there were only a single namespace definition containing a union of the enclosed definitions. Thus, a namespace definition with the same name as a preceding defini­ tion MAY be seen as a kind of continuation of the earlier one.
>
> *Namespace Definition Examples*

[TABLE]

[TABLE]

### PROTOCOL Definition (protocol-def)

> *PROTOCOL Definition Syntax*

[TABLE]

> PROTOCOL defines a Matter protocol. A Matter protocol is a group of logically related Matter TLV con­ structs that together serve a common purpose.
>
> Similar to a namespace definition, a PROTOCOL definition introduces a new naming scope in which fur­ ther definitions may appear. The names of definitions appearing within the braces of a PROTOCOL are scoped in exactly the same way as if they had appeared within a namespace definition. Likewise, con­ structs outside the PROTOCOL definition MAY refer to definitions within the protocol by using a scoped name that includes the protocol name. The PROTOCOL scoped definitions SHALL be separated by commas.
>
> PROTOCOL definitions MAY appear at the global naming scope, or within a namespace definition. However, PROTOCOL definitions SHALL NOT be nested within other PROTOCOL definitions at any depth.
>
> Every PROTOCOL definition SHALL include an [id](#id-1) qualifier giving the id of the protocol, that uniquely identifies the protocol among all other protocols. The id given in a PROTOCOL definition SHALL be unique relative to all other PROTOCOL definitions in a schema. However, it is legal to have multiple PROTOCOL definitions with the same protocol id, provided that they also have the same name and appear within the same naming scope. The effect of this is as if there were only a single PROTOCOL definition containing a union of the enclosed definitions. This makes it possible to break up a PROTO­ COL definition across multiple schema files.
>
> *PROTOCOL Definition Example*

[TABLE]

### VENDOR Definition (vendor-def)

> *VENDOR Definition Syntax*

[TABLE]

> VENDOR associates a name with a Vendor ID. VENDOR definition SHALL include an [id](#id-1) qualifier giving the id of the vendor.
>
> In a TLV Schema that includes a VENDOR definition, the vendor name MAY be used elsewhere in the schema as a stand-in for the associated [Vendor ID](#vendor-identifier-vendor-id-vid). One such place where a vendor name may appear is within the id qualifier of a PROTOCOL definition.
>
> VENDOR definitions MAY only appear at the global name scope, implying they SHALL NOT be placed within the body of a namespace or PROTOCOL definition.
>
> Both the name and id value used in a VENDOR definition SHALL be unique across all such definitions. However, for convenience, a VENDOR definition MAY be repeated provided that the name and id are the same.
>
> The Matter vendor (0x00000) is implicitly defined in all schemas, although it MAY be explicitly defined as well:
>
> *VENDOR Definition Example*

[TABLE]

## Types

> The TLV format supports 10 fundamental types: integers (signed and unsigned), floats, booleans, UTF-8 strings, octet strings, structures, arrays, lists and nulls. Accordingly, a TLV Schema MAY use one of the following type constructs to constrain an encoding to be one of these fundamental types.

### ARRAY / ARRAY OF

> *ARRAY Syntax*

[TABLE]

> ARRAY and ARRAY OF declare an element that is encoded as a TLV [Array](#arrays).
>
> ARRAY OF declares an array where all the items in the array are of the same fundamental type, or taken from the same set of possible types. This form of array is called a *uniform array*, and is gener­ ally used to represent ordered collections of values.
>
> ARRAY declares an array where the types of the array items follow a particular pattern. In this form, known as a *pattern array*; the allowed type for an item depends on its position in the array. The overall pattern of types allowed in the array is declared using a schema construct called a linear type pattern, which is similar to a regular expression (see below). Pattern arrays are typically used to represent vectors, tuples or paths.
>
> A [length](#length) qualifier on an array MAY be used to constraint the minimum and maximum number of items in the array. For a pattern array, the given length constraint SHALL be consistent with (i.e. fall within) the minimum and maximum number of items implied by the type pattern. In cases where the length qualifier places a narrower constraint on the length of an array than that implied by the type pattern, the length qualifier constraint takes precedence.
>
> A [nullable](#nullable-1) qualifier MAY be used to indicate that a TLV [Null](#nulls) MAY be encoded in place of the ARRAY or ARRAY OF. Note that an array that has been replaced by a Null is distinct in terms of its encoding from an array that has no items.

#### Linear Type Patterns

> A linear type pattern describes the sequence of TLV types that MAY appear in a TLV Array or List element. In its simplest form, a linear type pattern is a list of type definitions, or references to defined types, where each item constrains the TLV type that appears at the corresponding position in the collection. The type pattern is always anchored at the start of the collection, with the first type constraining the first item in the collection. Any type or pseudo-type MAY appear within a lin­ ear type pattern.
>
> More complex type patterns can be created by using a quantifier. Quantifiers appear after a type in a type pattern and specify the number of times the associated type MAY appear at that position in the collection. Quantifiers borrow common regular expression notation to denote repetition, with \* meaning zero or more, + meaning one or more, and { } expressing specific counts. Using quanti­ fiers, one can express complex sequences of types, including some that require arbitrary look- ahead to match.

#### Item Names

> Items or groups of items in a pattern array MAY be given textual names. These names do not affect the encoding of the array, but serve as user documentation, or as input to code generation tools. Item names within a pattern array SHALL be unique.
>
> Per the rules for encoding TLV arrays, array items SHALL NOT have tags. Thus the tag qualifier SHALL NOT be applied to an item name with a pattern array.
>
> *ARRAY Example*

[TABLE]

[TABLE]

### BOOLEAN

> *BOOLEAN Syntax*

[TABLE]

> BOOLEAN declares an element that SHALL be encoded as a TLV [Boolean](#booleans). If the [nullable](#nullable-1) qualifier is given, a TLV [Null](#nulls) MAY be encoded in its place.
>
> *BOOLEAN Example*

[TABLE]

### FLOAT32 / FLOAT64

> *FLOAT Syntax*

[TABLE]

> FLOAT32 declares an element that SHALL be encoded as a TLV [floating point number](#floating-point-numbers) with the [ele­](#element-type-field) [ment type](#element-type-field) indicating a 4-octet [IEEE 754-2019](#_bookmark28) single-precision value. Correspondingly, FLOAT64 declares a TLV element that SHALL be encoded as a TLV [floating point number](#floating-point-numbers) with the [element](#element-type-field)
>
> [type](#element-type-field) indicating an 8-octet [IEEE 754-2019](#_bookmark28) double-precision value.
>
> If the [nullable](#nullable-1) qualifier is given, a TLV [Null](#nulls) MAY be encoded in place of the number.
>
> The allowed range of values can be constrained using the [range](#range) qualifier. If omitted, the value is constrained by what the relevant TLV type can represent.
>
> *FLOAT Example*

[TABLE]

### SIGNED INTEGER / UNSIGNED INTEGER

> *Integer Syntax*

[TABLE]

> SIGNED INTEGER declares an element that SHALL be encoded as a TLV [integer](#integers) with the [element type](#element-type-field) indicating the integer is signed. Correspondingly, UNSIGNED INTEGER declares a TLV element that SHALL be encoded as a TLV [integer](#integers) with the [element type](#element-type-field) indicating the integer is unsigned.
>
> If the [nullable](#nullable-1) qualifier is given, a TLV [Null](#nulls) MAY be encoded in place of the integer.
>
> The allowed range of values MAY be constrained using the [range](#range) qualifier. If omitted, the value is constrained by what the relevant TLV type can represent.
>
> SIGNED INTEGER and UNSIGNED INTEGER definitions MAY include a set of enumerated values (enum), each of which associates a textual name (identifier) with a constant integer value (int-value). Each value SHALL conform to the allowed range of values for the SIGNED INTEGER definition as given by its sign and any range qualifier. The presence of enumerated values SHALL NOT restrict senders to only encoding those values. Rather, enumerations merely give symbolic names to particular note­ worthy values.
>
> *Integer Examples*

[TABLE]

### LIST / LIST OF

> *LIST Syntax*

[TABLE]

> LIST and LIST OF declare an element that is encoded as a TLV [List](#lists). LIST and LIST OF declare the same fundamental type, but differ based on how the allowed types of their items are expressed.
>
> LIST OF declares a list where all the items in the list are of the same fundamental type, or taken from the same set of possible types. This form of list is called a *uniform list*. Uniform lists are gener­ ally used to represent ordered collections of values where the tags differentiate the semantic mean­ ing of the value.
>
> LIST declares a *pattern list* where the types of the items in the list follow a particular pattern. In this form, the allowed type(s) for an item depends on its position in the array. Pattern lists are typically used to represent path-like constructs.
>
> The overall pattern of types allowed in a pattern list is declared using a schema construct called a linear type pattern. The syntax and interpretation of linear type patterns for pattern lists are the same as those for pattern arrays (see [Section B.3.1.1, “Linear Type Patterns”](#linear-type-patterns)).
>
> The [length](#length) qualifier MAY be used to constraint the minimum and maximum number of items in the list. For a pattern list, the given length constraint SHALL be consistent with (i.e. fall within) the min­ imum and maximum number of items implied by the type pattern. In cases where the length quali­ fier places a narrower constraint on the length of a list than that implied by the type pattern, the length qualifier constraint takes precedence.
>
> A [nullable](#nullable-1) qualifier MAY be used to indicate that a TLV [Null](#nulls) MAY be encoded in place of the LIST or LIST OF. Note that a list that has been replaced by a Null is distinct (in terms of its encoding) from a list that has no items.

#### Item Names

> As with the ARRAY type, items or groups of items in a pattern list MAY be given textual names to dis­ tinguish their purposes. Item names within a pattern list SHALL be unique.

#### Item Tags

> Items within a pattern list can have a tag qualifier that specifies a particular tag value that SHALL be encoded with the item. The specific tag can be protocol-specific or context-specific, or the anony­ mous tag. The assigned tag values are not required to be unique among the items in a pattern list.
>
> When no explicit tag qualifier is given (which is always the case for uniform lists) the items in a list automatically assume the default tag of their underlying types, if such a tag is provided. This can occur in two situations: 1) when the underlying type is a reference to a type definition that declares a default tag, and 2) when the underlying type is a CHOICE OF whose alternates declare default tags. See [default tag](#default-tags) for further information.
>
> If no tag qualifier is given, and no default tag is available, an encoder is allowed to encode list items with any tag of their choosing.

### OCTET STRING

> *OCTET STRING Syntax*

[TABLE]

> OCTET STRING declares an element that is encoded as a TLV [Octet String](#utf-8-and-octet-strings), and in particular with the [element type](#element-type-field) indicating it’s an Octet String.
>
> The minimum and maximum number of bytes can be constrained using the [length](#length) qualifier.
>
> *OCTET STRING Example*

[TABLE]

### NULL

> *NULL Syntax*

[TABLE]

> NULL declares an element that SHALL be encoded as a TLV [Null](#nulls). There are no qualifiers that can be associated with a NULL type.
>
> *NULL Example*

[TABLE]

### STRING

> *STRING Syntax*

[TABLE]

> STRING declares an element that is encoded as a TLV [UTF-8 String](#utf-8-and-octet-strings), and in particular with the [ele­](#element-type-field) [ment type](#element-type-field) indicating it’s a UTF-8 String.
>
> If the [nullable](#nullable-1) qualifier is given, a TLV [Null](#nulls) MAY be encoded in place of the string.
>
> The minimum and maximum length of the string can be constrained using the [length](#length) qualifier.
>
> *STRING Example*

[TABLE]

### STRUCTURE

> *STRUCTURE Syntax*

[TABLE]

[TABLE]

> STRUCTURE declares an element that is encoded as a TLV [Structure](#structures). The STRUCTURE fields SHALL be separated by commas.
>
> A STRUCTURE definition declares the list of fields that MAY appear within the corresponding TLV [Structure](#structures). Each field definition gives the type of the field, its tag, and an associated textual name. The field type MAY be either a fundamental type, a CHOICE OF pseudo-type, an ANY pseudo-type, or a reference to one of these types defined outside the STRUCTURE definition.
>
> A STRUCTURE definition MAY also contain one or more includes statements. Each such statement identifies a FIELD GROUP definition whose fields are to be included within the TLV [Structure](#structures) as if they had been declared within the STRUCTURE definition itself (see [Includes FIELD GROUP](#includes-field-group) below).
>
> An [extensible](#extensible) qualifier MAY be used to declare that a structure can be extended at encoding time by the inclusion of fields not listed in the STRUCTURE definition.
>
> The [order](#any-order-schema-order-tag-order) qualifiers (any-order, schema-order and tag-order) MAY be used to specify a particular order for the encoding of fields within a TLV [Structure](#structures).
>
> A [nullable](#nullable-1) qualifier MAY be used to indicate that a TLV [Null](#nulls) MAY be encoded in place of the STRUC­ TURE.

#### Fields

> Fields within a STRUCTURE are assigned textual names to distinguish them from one another. Each such name SHALL be distinct from all other field names defined within the STRUCTURE or included via a includes statement. Fields names do not affect the encoding of the resultant TLV, but MAY serve as either user documentation or input to code generation tools.
>
> Per the rules of TLV, all fields within a TLV [Structure](#structures) SHALL be encoded with a distinct TLV tag. Field tags are declared by placing a [tag](#tag) qualifier on the field name. Both protocol-specific and con­ text-specific tags are allowed on the fields in a STRUCTURE definition.
>
> For a given field if the tag qualifier is missing then the underlying type SHALL provide a [default tag](#default-tags). This can occur in two situations:

1.  the underlying type is a reference to a type definition that provides a default tag

2.  the underlying type is a CHOICE OF [pseudo-type](#pseudo-types) whose alternates provide default tags. The tags associated with includes fields are inherited from the target FIELD GROUP definition.

> All tags associated with the fields of a TLV [Structure](#structures) SHALL be unique. This is true not only for tags declared directly within the STRUCTURE definition, but also for any tags associated with fields that are incorporated via an includes statement.
>
> The anonymous tag SHALL NOT be used as the tag for a field within a STRUCTURE definition.
>
> The [optional](#optional) qualifier MAY be used to declare a field which can be omitted from the structure encoding under some circumstances.

#### CHOICE OF Fields

> A field within a STRUCTURE definition MAY be defined to be a [CHOICE OF](#choice-of) (either directly within the STRUCTURE definition or via a type reference). Over the wire, such a field is encoded as one of the alternate types given in the CHOICE OF definition. For example, the user-id field in the following STRUCTURE MAY be encoded as either a TLV [UTF-8 String](#utf-8-and-octet-strings) or an [Unsigned Integer](#integers).
>
> *STRUCTURE with CHOICE OF Field Example*

[TABLE]

> If a [tag](#tag) qualifier is given for a CHOICE OF field (e.g. \[1\] as shown above), that tag SHALL be used in the encoding of the field for all possible alternates. On the other hand, if a [tag](#tag) qualifier is *not* given, then the default tag associated with the selected CHOICE OF alternate SHALL be used in the encoding. For example, in the following structure, a context-tag of 1 will be encoded if the user-id field is an Unsigned Integer, or 2 if the field is a String.
>
> *STRUCTURE with CHOICE OF Field with Default Tag Example*

[TABLE]

> Note that, in all cases, the tag or tags associated with a CHOICE OF field SHALL be unique within the context of the containing STRUCTURE.

#### Includes FIELD GROUP

> A includes statement MAY be used within a STRUCTURE definition to incorporate the fields of a FIELD GROUP defined outside the STRUCTURE. The fields of the FIELD GROUP are included in the STRUCTURE as if they had been listed within the STRUCTURE definition itself.
>
> A particular FIELD GROUP SHALL NOT be included more than once within a given STRUCTURE.
>
> The names assigned to fields within an included FIELD GROUP SHALL be distinct with respect to all other fields contained within the enclosing STRUCTURE, whether defined directly within the STRUCTURE itself, or included from another FIELD GROUP.
>
> Likewise, tags assigned to fields within an included FIELD GROUP SHALL be distinct with respect to all other fields within the enclosing STRUCTURE.

## Pseudo-Types

> Pseudo-types are type-like constructs that provide flexibility in schema definitions. Some pseudo- types, like CHOICE OF and ANY, allow for variance in the fundamental TLV types that may appear in an encoding. Others make it easier to reuse schema constructs in multiple contexts.

### ANY

> *ANY Syntax*

[TABLE]

> ANY declares an element that can be encoded as any fundamental TLV type. Note that ANY is not a fundamental TLV type itself, but rather a pseudo-type that identifies a range of possible encodings. An ANY type serves a shorthand for (and is exactly equivalent to) a CHOICE OF all possible fundamen­ tal types.
>
> There are no qualifiers that can be associated with an ANY type.
>
> *ANY Example*

[TABLE]

### CHOICE OF

> *CHOICE OF Syntax*

[TABLE]

[TABLE]

> CHOICE OF declares an element that MAY be any of a set of TLV types. CHOICE OF is considered a [pseudo-type](#pseudo-types), rather than a fundamental type, in that the CHOICE OF itself doesn’t have a representa­ tion in the final TLV encoding.
>
> The allowed TLV types for a CHOICE OF, known as alternates, are given in the body of the definition. An alternate MAY be any of the fundamental TLV types, an ANY pseudo-type, or another CHOICE OF definition (more on this below). Additionally, an alternate MAY be a type reference (in the form of a scoped type name) referring to a type defined outside of the CHOICE OF definition.
>
> A [nullable](#nullable-1) qualifier MAY be used to indicate that a TLV [Null](#nulls) can be encoded in place of the CHOICE OF. This is exactly the same as if NULL had been listed as one of the alternates.

#### Alternate Names and Tags

> Alternates MAY be assigned textual names to distinguish them from one another. Each such name SHALL be unique within the particular CHOICE OF definition. Alternate names do not affect the encoding of the resultant TLV. Rather, alternate names serve as user documentation, or as input to code generation tools.
>
> Named CHOICE OF alternates MAY include at [tag](#tag) qualifier assigning a particular tag value to the alternate. When qualified in this way, the given tag value serves as a default tag for the alternate whenever the CHOICE OF appears in a context that doesn’t otherwise specify a tag. The tags assigned within a CHOICE OF do not need to be unique, although see the discussion of [Ambiguous Alternates](#ambiguous-alternates) below.
>
> Both protocol-specific and context-specific tags are allowed on the alternates of a CHOICE OF defini­ tion.

#### Nested CHOICE OF and CHOICE OF Merging

> It is legal for an alternate within a CHOICE OF to be another CHOICE OF definition, or a type reference to such. In this case, the effect is exactly as if the alternates of the inner CHOICE OF definition had been declared directly with the outer definition. This merging of CHOICE OF alternates occurs to any level of nesting, and MAY be used as a means of declaring multiple CHOICE OF that are supersets of other CHOICE OF.
>
> When alternates are merged, their names are preserved. In cases where the same name appears in nested CHOICE OF definitions, the name of the outer alternate is prepended to that of the inner alter­ nate, separated by a dot, to form a unique name for the merged alternate. In these cases, the outer alternate SHALL have a name in the schema, to ensure uniqueness.
>
> An example of invalid CHOICE OF syntax, which results in a name conflict when alternates are merged:

> *CHOICE OF Invalid Alternates Merge Example*

[TABLE]

> The example below shows how a valid schema should look to avoid conflict:
>
> *CHOICE OF Valid Alternates Merge Example*

[TABLE]

#### Ambiguous Alternates

> A CHOICE OF MAY contain multiple alternates having the same fundamental TLV type (e.g. two alter­ nates that are both SIGNED INTEGER). If these alternates are also encoded using the same tag, their encoded forms are effectively indistinguishable from one another. Such alternates are referred to as ambiguous alternates.
>
> Ambiguous alternates MAY occur due to the merging of nested CHOICE OF definitions (see above). They MAY also arise in cases where the tags associated with the alternates are overridden by a tag qualifier in an outer context; e.g. when a STRUCTURE incorporates a CHOICE OF field that has a specific tag qualifier assigned to the field.
>
> Ambiguous alternates are legal in TLV Schemas. However, care SHALL be taken when introducing ambiguous alternates to ensure that a decoder can correctly interpret the resulting encoding. This can be achieved, for example, by signaling the appropriate interpretation via a data value (e.g. an enumerated integer) contained elsewhere in the encoding.

## Qualifiers

> Qualifiers are annotations that provide additional information regarding the use or interpretation of a schema construct. Often qualifiers are used to place restrictions on the form or range of values that the construct can assume.

### any-order / schema-order / tag-order

> *Order Qualifiers Syntax*

[TABLE]

> The any-order, schema-order and tag-order qualifiers MAY be used to specify a particular order for the encoding of fields within a STRUCTURE.
>
> The any-order qualifier specifies that the encoder of a TLV structure is free to encode the fields of the structure in any desired order.
>
> The schema-order qualifier specifies that the fields of a structure SHALL be encoded in the order given within the associated STRUCTURE definition. If the STRUCTURE definition contains one or more includes statements, the fields of the referenced FIELD GROUPs SHALL be encoded in the order given in the respective FIELD GROUP definition, and at the position of the includes statement relative to other fields within the STRUCTURE.
>
> The tag-order qualifier specifies that the fields of a structure SHALL be encoded in the order speci­ fied by their tags, as defined in [Section A.2.4, “Canonical Ordering of Tags”](#canonical-ordering-of-tags).
>
> Only a single ordering qualifier MAY be applied to a given STRUCTURE type.
>
> In the absence of an order qualifier, fields within TLV structure MAY generally be encoded in any order. However, the author of a STRUCTURE definition MAY choose to impose custom ordering con­ straints on some or all of the fields if so desired. Such constraints SHALL be clearly described in the prose documentation for the schema.

### extensible

> *extensible Qualifier Syntax*

[TABLE]

> The extensible qualifier is only allowed on STRUCTURE types, and declares that the structure MAY be extended by the inclusion of fields not listed in its definition. When a structure is extended in this way, any new fields that are included SHALL use tags that are distinct from any of those associated with defined or included fields.
>
> Absent the extensible qualifier, a structure encoding SHALL NOT include fields beyond those given
>
> in the STRUCTURE definition.
>
> *extensible Qualifier Example*

[TABLE]

### id

> *id Qualifier Syntax*

[TABLE]

> The id qualifier is used to specify an identifying number associated with a VENDOR or PROTOCOL defini­ tion.
>
> When applied to a VENDOR definition, the id value is a 16-bit unsigned integer specifying the [Protocol](#protocol-vendor-id-16-bits) [Vendor ID](#protocol-vendor-id-16-bits), which uniquely identify an organization or company. VENDOR ids are used to scope other identifiers (e.g. PROTOCOL ids) such that organizations can independently mint these identifiers with­ out fear of collision.
>
> When applied to a PROTOCOL definition, the id value MAY take three forms:

- 32-bit unsigned integer, which is composed of a [Protocol Vendor ID](#protocol-vendor-id-16-bits) in the high 16-bits and a [protocol id](#protocol-id-16-bits) in the low 16-bits

- two 16-bit unsigned integers (separated by a colon) specifying the [Protocol Vendor ID](#protocol-vendor-id-16-bits) and [proto­](#protocol-id-16-bits) [col id](#protocol-id-16-bits)

- vendor-name and 16-bit [protocol id](#protocol-id-16-bits) (separated by a colon). The vendor-name definition SHALL exist elsewhere in the schema

> *id Qualifier Examples*

[TABLE]

[TABLE]

### length

> *length Qualifier Syntax*

[TABLE]

> The length qualifier MAY be used to constrain the number of elements in a collection type, such as an ARRAY or LIST, or the number of bytes in a STRING or OCTET STRING type.

### nullable

> *nullable Qualifier Syntax*

[TABLE]

> The nullable qualifier is used with ARRAY, LIST, STRUCTURE, STRING, OCTET STRING, BOOLEAN, SIGNED INTE­ GER, UNSIGNED INTEGER, FLOAT32, FLOAT64 types. The nullable qualifier declares that a TLV [Null](#nulls) MAY be substituted for a value of the specified type at a particular point in an encoding. For example, in the following sensor-sample structure, a null value MAY be encoded for the value field (e.g. in the case the sensor was off-line at the sample time):
>
> *nullable Qualifier Example*

[TABLE]

> Applying a nullable qualifier to a type is exactly the same as defining a CHOICE OF type with alter­ nates for the primary and NULL. For example, the sensor sample structure could also be defined as follows:
>
> *nullable Qualifier Example*

[TABLE]

[TABLE]

### optional

> *optional Qualifier Syntax*

[TABLE]

> The optional qualifier declares that a field within a STRUCTURE or FIELD GROUP is optional, and MAY be omitted by an encoder. The optional qualifier MAY only appear on the name portion of a field definition within either a STRUCTURE or FIELD GROUP.
>
> Note that an optional field is distinct, both semantically and in terms of encoding, from a field whose type has been declared [nullable](#nullable-1). In the former case the field MAY be omitted from the encod­ ing altogether. In the latter case the field SHALL appear within the encoding, however its value MAY be encoded as a TLV [Null](#nulls). It is legal to declare a field that is both optional and nullable.
>
> The conditions under which an optional field can be omitted depend on the semantics of the struc­ ture. In some cases, fields MAY be omitted entirely at the discretion of the sender. In other cases, omission of a field MAY be contingent on the value present in another field. In all cases, prose docu­ mentation associated with the field definition SHALL make clear the rules for when the field may be omitted.
>
> Optional fields are allowed within FIELD GROUP and retain their optionality when included within
>
> STRUCTURE.
>
> *optional Qualifier Example*

[TABLE]

### range

> *range Qualifier Syntax*

[TABLE]

> The range qualifier MAY be used to constrain the range of values for a numeric type such as SIGNED INTEGER, UNSIGNED INTEGER, FLOAT32, or FLOAT64. Two forms are supported: *explicit constraints* and *width constraints*. Only one form MAY be applied to a given type.
>
> An *explicit constraint* gives specific minimum and maximum (inclusive) values for the type. These MAY be any value that is legal for the underlying type.
>
> A *width constraint* constrains the value to fit within a specific number of bytes. Any of the width constraints (8-bits, 16-bits, 32-bits or 64-bits) MAY be applied to SIGNED INTEGER and UNSIGNED INTEGER types, where 8-bits, 16-bits, 32-bits and 64-bits constraints correspond to 1-octet, 2-octet, 4-octet and 8-octet [element type](#element-type-field) respectively; only 32-bits constraint MAY be applied to FLOAT32 type and only 64-bits constraint MAY be applied to FLOAT64 type.
>
> Note that a width constraint range qualifier does not obligate an encoder to always encode the spec­ ified number of bits. Per the TLV encoding rules, senders are always free to encode integer and floating point values in any encoding size, bigger or smaller, that will accommodate the value.
>
> *range Qualifier Example*

[TABLE]

### tag

> *tag Qualifier Syntax*

[TABLE]

> The tag qualifier is allowed on type names, field names within a STRUCTURE ([STRUCTURE Fields](#fields)) or
>
> FIELD GROUP, item names within a LIST ([LIST Item Tags](#item-tags)), alternate names within a CHOICE OF ([CHOICE](#choice-of-fields)
>
> [OF Fields](#choice-of-fields)).
>
> The tag qualifier specifies a numeric tag value to be used when encoding a particular value. For brevity, the tag keyword SHALL be omitted when specifying a tag qualifier. As a special case, the keyword anonymous MAY be used to signal a value that SHALL be encoded without a tag.
>
> Matter TLV supports two forms of tags: [Protocol-Specific Tags](#profile-specific-tags) and [Context-Specific Tags](#context-specific-tags). A protocol- specific tag is a colon-separated tuple containing a protocol-id and a tag-num. Protocol ids MAY also be specified indirectly, by giving the name of a PROTOCOL definition (protocol-name) located else­ where in the schema. An asterisk (\*) MAY be used as a shorthand to refer to the id of the PROTOCOL definition in which the tag qualifier appears. This protocol is referred to as the *current protocol*.

#### Explicit Tags

> A tag qualifier that appears on a field within a STRUCTURE or FIELD GROUP, or on an item within a LIST, specifies the exact tag to be used when encoding the associated field/item. Such a tag is called an explicit tag, and MAY be either a context-specific, protocol-specific or anonymous (for LIST) tag.
>
> If a field or item lacks a tag qualifier, then the encoding will use a [default tag](#default-tags) associated with the underlying field type, if such a tag has been specified.

#### Default Tags

> A tag qualifier that appears on a type definition, or on an alternate within a CHOICE OF, serves as a default tag. A default tag is used to encode a value when an explicit tag has not been given in the schema.
>
> For example, a field within a STRUCTURE that refers to a type with a default tag will use that tag if no tag qualifier has been specified on the field itself. Similarly, tag qualifiers that appear on the alter­ nates of a CHOICE OF serve as default tags to be used when no other tag has been specified.
>
> Both context-specific and protocol-specific tags MAY be used as default tags. 'anonymous\` tag SHALL NOT be used as default tag.

# Appendix C: Tag-length-value (TLV) Payload Text Representation Format

## Introduction

> This section describes a means by which to depict TLV payloads in a more user-friendly, textual rep­ resentation.

## Format Specification

### Tag/Value

> TLV elements are tag/value pairs. As such, their general textual representation is as follows:

[TABLE]

### Context-Specific Tags

> The basic representation of a context-specific tag is a single scalar number. TLV entries using context-specific tags MAY use the basic representation alone:

[TABLE]

> If the tag has a name from an associated schema, it MAY be represented using that name. The basic representation MAY also be appended in parentheses ("(", ")"):

[TABLE]

### Protocol-Specific Tags

> The basic representation of a protocol-specific tag SHALL be fully-qualified with "::" separating the vendor id and the protocol number and ":" separating the protocol number and tag number. The vendor id, protocol number and tag number are each represented using a single scalar number represented in hexadecimal notation.

[TABLE]

> If the tag has a name from an associated schema, it MAY be represented using that name. The basic representation MAY also be appended in parentheses ("(", ")"):

[TABLE]

### Anonymous Tags

> TLV entries using anonymous tags SHALL display the value alone:

[TABLE]

### Primitive Types

> Signed Integer:

[TABLE]

> Unsigned Integer:

[TABLE]

> If the value is a defined constant, or enumerated value, then the string literal MAY be provided as well:

[TABLE]

> UTF-8 string:

[TABLE]

> Octet String (listed as 8-bit hex digits):

[TABLE]

> Floats:

[TABLE]

> Booleans:

[TABLE]

> Null:

[TABLE]

### Complex Types: Structure

> Braces ({ … }) SHALL be used to convey the start and end of structure scope, with the members separated by commas (,):

[TABLE]

### Complex Types: Arrays

> Square brackets (\[ … \]) SHALL be used to convey array scope, with elements in the array sepa­ rated by commas (,). Since elements in the array are required to be anonymous, each element SHALL display the value alone:

[TABLE]

### Complex Types: List

> Double square brackets (\[\[ … \]\]) SHALL be used to convey list scope, with elements in the list sep­ arated by commas (,). Since a diversity of tag types can be used in a list (including duplicates), the tags SHALL always be present and explicitly stated:

# Appendix D: Status Report Messages

## Overview

> The StatusReport is a core message that encapsulates the result of an operation which a responder sends as a reply for requests sent from an initiator, using a common message of the [Secure Channel](#secure-channel-protocol) [Protocol](#secure-channel-protocol) (Protocol ID = [PROTOCOL_ID_SECURE_CHANNEL](#_bookmark249)).
>
> This section details the standard Status Report message format encoding as Matter Message Format payloads.

## Status Report elements

> A Status Report message describes a protocol-specific operation result or status.
>
> The Status Report message SHALL have the following message header values (some of which may be omitted within protocol messages, as per header flag rules), no matter which protocol actually generated the status report:

- A [Protocol Vendor ID](#protocol-vendor-id-16-bits) set to 0 (Matter common Vendor ID)

- A [Protocol ID](#protocol-id-16-bits) set to 0x0000 ([PROTOCOL_ID_SECURE_CHANNEL](#_bookmark249))

- A [Protocol Opcode](#protocol-opcode-8-bits) set to 0x40 ([StatusReport](#secure-channel-protocol-messages))

> The report message’s [Application Payload](#application-payload-variable-length) SHALL consist of:

- A mandatory *GENERAL CODE* field, providing a general description of the status being reported.

- A mandatory *PROTOCOL SPECIFIC STATUS* field, providing additional details

- An **optional** protocol-specific data section that MAY include any additional information that a protocol requires

  - Individual protocols define the contents of this data section and how it is handled

## Message Format

[TABLE]

1.  **General status codes (**GeneralCode**)**

> General status codes conveyed in the GeneralCode field are uniform codes that convey both success and failures.
>
> The following general status codes are defined:

| **Code** | **Numeric Value** | **Description** |
|----|----|----|
| SUCCESS | 0 | Operation completed successfully. |
| FAILURE | 1 | Generic failure, additional details may be included in the *protocol specific status*. |
| BAD_PRECONDITION | 2 | Operation was rejected by the system because the sys­ tem is in an invalid state. |
| OUT_OF_RANGE | 3 | A value was out of a required range |
| BAD_REQUEST | 4 | A request was unrecognized or malformed |
| UNSUPPORTED | 5 | An unrecognized or unsupported request was received |
| UNEXPECTED | 6 | A request was not expected at this time |
| RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED | 7 | Insufficient resources to process the given request |
| BUSY | 8 | Device is busy and cannot handle this request at this time |
| TIMEOUT | 9 | A timeout occurred |
| CONTINUE | 10 | Context-specific signal to proceed |
| ABORTED | 11 | Failure, may be due to a concurrency error. |
| INVALID_ARGUMENT | 12 | An invalid/unsupported argument was provided |
| NOT_FOUND | 13 | Some requested entity was not found |
| ALREADY_EXISTS | 14 | The sender attempted to create something that already exists |
| PERMISSION_DENIED | 15 | The sender does not have sufficient permissions to exe­ cute the requested operations. |
| DATA_LOSS | 16 | Unrecoverable data loss or corruption has occurred. |
| MESSAGE_TOO_LARGE | 17 | Message size is larger than the recipient can handle. |

> If none of the specific codes above fits for application usage, a protocol SHALL use *FAILURE* and provide more information encoded in the ProtocolId and ProtocolCode subfields.

2.  **Protocol-specific codes (**ProtocolId **and** ProtocolCode**)**

> The protocol-specific portion of StatusReport messages is composed of a fully-qualified ProtocolId
>
> which qualifies the subsequent ProtocolCode space.
>
> The ProtocolId is encoded as a 32 bit value of [Protocol Vendor ID](#protocol-vendor-id-16-bits) (upper 16 bits) and [Protocol ID](#protocol-id-16-bits)
>
> under that Protocol Vendor ID (lower 16 bits), similarly to how message [Protocol ID](#protocol-id-16-bits) and Protocol Vendor ID are encoded in the [Protocol Header](#protocol-header-field-descriptions).
>
> The following rules apply to the encoding of the ProtocolCode protocol-specific field:

- ProtocolCode value 0x0000 SHALL be reserved for use as success placeholder when either a Gen­ eralCode of *SUCCESS* (0) or *CONTINUE* (10) are present.

- ProtocolCode value 0xFFFF SHALL be reserved to indicate that no additional protocol-specific status code is available.

- When the GeneralCode is *FAILURE*, the ProtocolCode value of 0xFFFF SHOULD NOT be used, since the conveyance of specific error codes assists in troubleshooting.

- ProtocolCode values 0x0001 through 0xFFFE SHALL be used to convey protocol-specific status indications.

> Since protocol-specific status reports are meant to convey more information than generic codes, it is RECOMMENDED to always use a specific ProtocolCode value, rather than 0xFFFF, unless there are no additional details to convey.

3.  **Protocol-specific data (**ProtocolData**)**

> The ProtocolData portion of the StatusReport message is composed of all data beyond the Protocol­ Code field. If a StatusReport message of size N octets is received, the first 8 octets of payload encode the GeneralCode, ProtocolId and ProtocolCode, while the remaining N - 8 bytes represent the proto­ col-specific ProtocolData.
>
> Encoding of the ProtocolData portion of the payload depends on the ProtocolId and potentially Pro­ tocolCode. To decode this data, the ProtocolId has to be examined and decoding SHALL be done according to that protocol specification. For example:

- A vendor-specific protocol would encode additional custom error metadata in the ProtocolData.

- The [Bulk transfer (BDX)](#bulk-data-exchange-protocol-bdx) protocol does not require additional error information and will always have ProtocolData empty.

1.  **Presenting** StatusReport **messages in protocol specifications**

> In order to simplify referring to StatusReport messages, the following mnemonic encoding will be used in the descriptive text for a given protocol.
>
> References to StatusReport messages take one of the following forms:

- No ProtocolData present:

  - StatusReport(GeneralCode: \<value\>, ProtocolId: \<value\>, ProtocolCode: \<value\>)

    - Example 1: StatusReport(GeneralCode: FAILURE, ProtocolId: BDX, ProtocolCode: START_OFFSET_NOT_SUPPORTED)

      - Encodes as: 01 00 02 00 00 00 52 00

&nbsp;

- Example 2: StatusReport(GeneralCode: SUCCESS, ProtocolId: {VendorID=0xFFF1, Proto­ colId=0xAABB}, ProtocolCode: 0)

  - Encodes as: 00 00 BB AA F1 FF 00 00

&nbsp;

- Additional ProtocolData present:

  - StatusReport(GeneralCode: \<value\>, ProtocolId: \<value\>, ProtocolCode: \<value\>, Protocol­ Data: \<value\>)

    - Example: StatusReport(GeneralCode: FAILURE, ProtocolId: {VendorID=0xFFF1, Proto­ colId=0xAABB}, ProtocolCode: 9921, ProtocolData: \[0x55, 0x66, 0xEE, 0xFF\])

      - Encodes as: 01 00 BB AA F1 FF C1 26 55 66 EE FF
